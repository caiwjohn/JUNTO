coindesk	100-billion-controversy-xrps-surge-raises-hard-questions-ripple	$100 Billion Controversy: XRP's Surge Raises Hard Questions for Ripple - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T20:37	Ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, is on a bull run. According to CoinDesk data, the price of XRP is up over 1,000 percent in just the last month alone, eclipsing $3.50 per coin Thursday after spending much of 2017 under $0.30. With a market capitalization above $120 billion, the token has usurped ethereum as the No. 2 cryptocurrency after bitcoin, and social media is rife with speculation about when it might take first place. But where some might see the kind of meteoric growth that's often associated with a breakout product, industry insiders have been quick to tap the brakes. Rather than herald the run-up as a success story, some are using the spotlight to revive long-standing controversies that have dogged the Ripple blockchain network, the startup that created it and its fair-weather approach to marketing the cryptocurrency. Indeed, founded with the mission to bring bitcoin's decentralized, cryptographic architecture to financial services, Ripple has had a complex relationship with XRP – at times touting it as a way for banks to transact seamlessly across borders, while at other points describing it as a benign value-add to enterprise versions of the company's software. Such hot-and-cold thinking has long been on display in the company's public remarks on the subject. As far back as 2012, for instance, the founder and former CEO of Ripple, Chris Larsen, spoke of the service as a bitcoin-like payment system. Only a couple years later, Larsen was de-emphasizing XRP's role, telling the Financial Times, "The world is not going to adopt a new math-based currency." Seemingly aligning with a rise in regulatory concerns over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, executives at Ripple even explained to Fortune in 2014 that its cryptocurrency is not meant to be a store of value or a medium of exchange. And there were times when Ripple leadership hesitated to call XRP a cryptocurrency at all. Asked directly about its use of terminology in 2016, Larsen pegged the decision to marketing, dismissing the term outright. "It's not powerful," he said then. "I think sometimes the word 'crypto,' branding-wise, is less institutional than 'digital asset.'" Yet, as the term "cryptocurrency" has come back into fashion over the past year, that narrative has changed. In contrast to his predecessor, Brad Garlinghouse, who replaced Larsen as CEO when he stepped down at the beginning of 2017, has proclaimed the value of cryptocurrency, specifically XRP. And in interview with CoinDesk Thursday, Asheesh Birla, who's been the vice president of product at Ripple for five years, said he doesn't remember anyone at the company downplaying the necessity of digital assets. Rather, he said: "What we did realize is that there is a pragmatic way of developing use cases that will use digital assets. I think that is a very pragmatic approach of building a payments solution. I think the patience, and the pragmatic nature that we’re working towards is paying off." And Birla has a point – three years ago digital assets were thinly traded compared to today, so it was hard to market XRP as a liquidity play. Yet the company's shift in tone, coupled with the XRP cryptocurrency's recent boom, has brought out a sea of critics who want to take Ripple to task for its seemingly opportunistic stance. However, they're being met by an equally strong force: a new group of crypto adopters who, all of a sudden, see XRP as an affordable way to get exposure to cryptocurrency and relieve their FOMO. The XRP faithful Given the passionate support of its online fanbase, it's perhaps not a surprise that Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency has attracted interest, especially as new investors seek to diversify in the cryptocurrency market. For instance, Ripple evangelist and XRP bull Tiffany Hayden wondered in a tweet whether XRP could jump 740 percent to reach $20 a coin, and while that might seem a stretch, it sounds more plausible when considering that XRP gained 30,000 percent over 2017. Further, according to a tweet from Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, if XRP's price stayed around where it's at today and bitcoin's stayed around $15,000 a coin, by the time each of those network's cryptocurrency units (100 billion for XRP, 21 million for bitcoin) had been released, the XRP Ledger would have a network value greater than bitcoin's. Since bitcoin hit $20,000 this past December, a slew of cryptocurrencies have reached new all-time highs, some even outperforming bitcoin by leaps and bounds. But what sets XRP's activity apart may be the sheer volume of crypto enthusiasts who, seemingly, are working under cloudy impressions of the industry. In speaking with retail buyers, CoinDesk has found that, for some, XRP is their very first foray into cryptocurrency. In one conversation, a source, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that a friend had pushed him to buy XRP. This investor also cited other reasons for taking the plunge: "Surely, because of the advantage of transferring funds very quickly and efficiently anywhere in the world; also its endorsement by [potentially] Amazon and Amex. It didn't hurt that it went from 20 cents to $1 rather quickly." It's an interesting answer that sheds light on the state of the crypto industry as it moves into 2018. Bogged down – at least in the eyes of new investors – by a years-long technical debate, bitcoin seems to have lost its hold on the faster, more efficient payment method use case. In turn, cryptocurrencies that seem more mainstream (such as XRP in its proximity to Ripple) are looking more attractive to rookies. Yet, the partnerships Ripple has forged recently hide an inconvenient truth – that enterprises using Ripple's services aren't necessarily using XRP. And as such, XRP investors might not understand they're buying into a cryptocurrency very different from bitcoin and the others that have gained widespread attention over the years. Without XRP Case in point: While XRP investors might be charmed by the thought of holding a cryptocurrency that one day a large swath of the banking system may use, the vast majority of Ripple's banking clients are using the company's xCurrent product – a glorified messaging platform. This product provides banks with real-time, bi-directional messaging with which they can track and manage cross-border payments, and is superior, Ripple executives say, to SWIFT's messaging platform, which only allows for one-way communication. So for instance, if an account number, name or some other data needed to send a payment gets mistyped when sending a SWIFT message, that message must go through its life cycle before the error can be corrected, with the receiving party sending back an error-and-cancellation message. The sending bank then has to go find where it messed up, and once the errors are corrected, a new transaction must be initiated. (However, SWIFT recently revealed a real-time gross settlement platform and is experimenting with blockchain technology to enhance its processes.) Ripple's platform, on the other hand, allows senders and receivers to communicate in real time, so simple errors can be fixed quickly, and transactions aren't canceled, but instead merely put on a momentary hold of sorts. Laid out to CoinDesk during the company's inaugural Swell conference in Toronto in October, Ripple's main product doesn't involve its XRP token at all. Onstage during the event, a number of banks using xCurrent asserted that they would not be using XRP anytime soon, contrary to what XRP investors might be banking on today. And xCurrent is the platform American Express is using. In mid-November, Amex announced that it had partnered with Ripple to connect Amex customers in the U.S. using U.S. dollars to Santander bank accounts in the U.K. using British pounds. During the launch, Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, Marcus Treacher, told CoinDesk that Amex and Santander were connected directly with no need for an intermediary cryptocurrency. Yet, the price of XRP rallied on that news, hitting a high, for the time, around $0.30 per coin. And now, with the price of XRP continuing its upward momentum, there seems to be another pump based on misperceptions about the Amex relationship and speculation that Amazon will accept XRP sometime this year – both were mentioned by the anonymous neophyte as reasons he's investing in XRP. Secondly, many investors new to the cryptocurrency space might not be aware of where all the XRP actually exist. Unlike bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, XRP isn't created on a particular timeline through mining – or the act of securing decentralized networks. Instead, the 100 billion XRPs (the cryptocurrency's coded limit) are already available, with most under the control of Ripple itself. Ripple currently controls about 61 billion XRP, although in May (where the price ranged from 5 cents to 41 cents) the company announced it would move to lock up 55 billion XRP is escrow, to be released at a rate of 1 billion a month for at least four and a half years. According to Birla, that lock-up started in December, and any XRP not used during the month is put back into the escrow accounts. In May, Garlinghouse told CoinDesk funds were being spent at a rate of 300 million per month, but Birla declined to disclose any updates to that number. Yet, Birla did say, with the price increase, the company would be re-evaluating what it needs. What's wrong? First and foremost, XRP's rise on old news and unconfirmed speculation displays one of the challenges within the crypto market – that there's no foolproof way to value cryptocurrencies. And not only that, but the definition of cryptocurrency is a bit murky as well. Because XRP's use is fixed to the Ripple Network, its protocol doesn't involve any mining and Ripple itself controls the majority of tokens, many long-time crypto enthusiasts would put XRP in a separate (albeit in some ways similar) bucket from bitcoin and other, more decentralized cryptocurrency projects. "XRP will go down as the Icarus of cryptocurrency," tweeted Preston Byrne, an outspoken blockchain pundit, referencing a Greek mythological tale about hubris. In an interview, Byrne said he finds extremely troubling the trend of private companies issuing their own monies, retaining some for employee compensation and working capital, listing them on exchanges for speculation and then selling their monies on those exchanges to fund operations. Byrne, the founder of Tomram Consultancy and former general counsel of blockchain startup Monax, told CoinDesk: "The scale of this activity has become distinctly market-distorting. My greatest fear is that these schemes could, if left unchecked, lead to a systemic crisis." And chief among the criticisms leveled at Ripple is that the project is not truly decentralized, and so is little more than blockchain hype on a traditional system. The bitcoin developer and perennial blockchain skeptic Peter Todd has recently taken to tweeting a number of his concerns, and while they're all focused around the question of decentralization, his real uneasiness with Ripple revolves around the company's opaqueness. Ripple relies on a Unique Node List (UNL) – currently encompassing five core validators all run by Ripple – when matters of consensus need to be determined. According to Ripple, it cannot recommend any new validators to this list. In Todd's interpretation, Ripple has been slow to add new nodes to the UNL primarily because these validators must be trusted entities that stay in consensus with Ripple itself. And while a number of people and organizations run nodes on the Ripple network, according to Todd, choosing to route transactions through a node that's not a part of the UNL means that if your node comes to a different determination about the state of consensus than those nodes run by Ripple, it could split you off onto a separate "Ripple" chain. While Birla seemed to acknowledge the issue in conversation, he also said XRP Ledger (which was rebranded from Ripple Ledger last year) was decentralized in that it is open for anyone to use or build on top of. "Anyone can download the XRP ledger package and become a validator and start broadcasting immediately, but getting everyone else to listen to you is a second point," Birla said. To address the paltry number of trusted nodes on the UNL (in comparison, bitcoin has about 10,000 validating nodes and ethereum has about 30,000), Ripple released a scaling roadmap which stated it intends to increase the number of trusted nodes on the UNL to 16 over the next 18 months. But according to Todd: "The really dangerous thing here is Ripple's technical documentation doesn't make any of these risks clear – nowhere do they describe in detail how nodes can fall out of consensus with one another if their UNLs don't match." First step Todd continued, saying that for Ripple's bank clients, being transparent about it's model as a centralized system that users can fully validate shouldn't be much of a problem.. "For some customers that may even be seen as an advantage," Todd told CoinDesk. Yet, he alleges that Ripple muddies the waters because "they don't want the market to lose confidence in XRP." This much is clear: right now the market has a lot of confidence in it. Yet, while it seems people are rushing into XRP ahead of any real use of the cryptocurrency, Birla said that more companies will be announcing their use of XRP in the first quarter of 2018. Birla said he expects a "full list" of XRP users this year, telling CoinDesk about the xRapid product, which is basically xCurrent with XRP on top: "There is a whole pipeline of folks now integrating into that product. We'll release names early this year." He continued, saying the success of getting banks to use Ripple's non-cryptocurrency-related products is positioned as the first step of a bigger plan to move banks to XRP. And Ripple has had success in getting financial institutions to see the value in its xCurrent product. In total, since it started its "war" on SWIFT and the legacy financial system, more than 100 companies have joined its network. As far as XRP itself is concerned, though, only one company has publicly revealed its use of the cryptocurrency. In October, Mexican financial services firm Cuallix partnered with Ripple to convert cross-border fund transfers into XRP for easy delivery between currencies. When asked whether new XRP investors understand the relationships between Ripple, its clients and XRP, Birla said, "Big names like Amex and smaller names, like other companies were signing, are all helping build out the network. We're adding on the liquidity [part] after that" – that is, the xRapid product that uses XRP. He continued, "We've been really clear. The way that we looked at solving problems was a very methodical approach, a pragmatic approach." According to him, XRP's use case couldn't be realized until Ripple had built out the network. "We've identified a use case, we've identified a pain point, we have real customers using our product," Birla said, concluding: "We have continued to get market traction. That has continued to get a lot of interest in Ripple and XRP in general." Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

coindesk	1k-next-ether-price-climbs-to-new-record-high	$1K Next? Ether Price Climbs to New Record High - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T13:00	The price of ether, the native token of the ethereum platform, has hit a new all-time high and is now eyeing the $1,000 mark. As of writing, ether (ETH) is trading at a record $978. The world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 11 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source CoinMarketCap. A deeper look at the individual markets suggests the cryptocurrency is trading above $1,000 on Asian exchanges offering ETH/KRW pairs. Meanwhile, on western exchanges, ETH is trading slightly below $950 levels. Notably, 24-hour trading volume stands at $5.83 billion, which marks a 125 percent increase since Jan. 1. A high volume rally indicates strong hands are at play and the move has legs. The technical chart also indicates scope for a rally to $1,045 levels. Ether 1-hour chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows: Bull flag breakout, a bullish continuation pattern. As per the measured height method (flag height added to breakout price), ether could rally to $1,045 levels. The relative strength index (RSI) is well short of the Jan. 1 high (overbought conditions), indicating scope for the rally. Other factors, including higher lows as represented by rising trend lines and the upward sloping 50-day moving average, also favor further upside in ETH prices. View Ether looks set to rise above $1,000 and possibly extend gains to $1,045–1,050 levels. The overbought conditions as shown by the daily RSI could yield a wave of profit taking, although dips below $875 (Dec. 19 high) could be short-lived, as suggested by the upward sloping moving averages.

coindesk	2017-year-crypto-became-new-asset-class	2017: The Year Crypto Became a New Asset Class - CoinDesk	2017-12-30T14:00	Hunter Horsley is the co-founder and CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, a cryptocurrency specialist asset manager which launched the first cryptocurrency index fund earlier this year. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review. 2017 has been a watershed year for crypto assets. The combined market cap rocketed from $15 billion in January to over $600 billion by year's end. And in doing so, crypto assets crossed another kind of threshold, transforming from something easily dismissed to something hard to ignore. The multiple-thousand percent price appreciation has been accompanied by trade volumes well over $1 billion since May, continued low correlations to other assets and sharpe ratios that compare favorably despite high volatility. Unsurprisingly, this is now attracting the interest of new market participants, retail and institutional alike. The spectrum of new investors ranges broadly — tech-savvy teenagers, busy mothers thinking about how to invest their savings, individuals disenchanted by central institutions, high-net worth professionals, nimble family offices, financial advisors on behalf of clients, and even sophisticated hedge funds and institutions. People are taking note of the returns, headlines in the media and stories of new millionaires being minted overnight. But they are also emboldened by low correlations, bitcoin’s eight-year track record of security, technical developments around protocols and an emerging ecosystem of companies working on crypto assets. To be sure, crypto assets are still in an early, immature, evolving stage of their existence. But this year was a milestone. As we head into the new year and take stock of 2017, I think we’ll regard it as the year that crypto assets officially became a new mainstream asset class, one with a distinct set of opportunities and challenges. Fragmentation As this new set of stakeholders contemplates investing, it has drawn into focus the challenges to accessing the market today. 2017 has been a year of tremendous growth for crypto assets, but also of increasing complexity and fragmentation. The fragmentation is a big deal. Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin had always been 85% of the total market cap of all crypto assets, that is until this year. As of May, bitcoin’s proportion has dropped to around 50%. Not because it’s lost value —it's up over 1,000% on the year— but rather because a number of other assets have appreciated to significant sizes. There are now over 10 crypto assets with a total supply valued upwards of $5 billion. Some are competing with bitcoin, while others are endeavoring to do different things, each with their own communities, contributors, advocates and critics. The implication for investors is that there’s a lot more research that needs to be done to understand the landscape. Prior to this year, an investor who wanted to invest in the crypto assets as an asset class might feasibly just buy bitcoin. But today, to bet on the asset class rather than picking winners you’d need to buy a portfolio and actively manage it as things change. Both of which are increasingly hard. What assets should an investor hold, in what allocations, where can you buy them, and what information do they need to monitor? All are new and pertinent questions for those seeking exposure to the space. Complexity This brings us to the second point, which is that the complexity of the space is immense and has increased tremendously this year. Different coins are tackling different use cases: some coins are focused on storing value like gold, some on private transactions, some on fast transactions, some on allocating resources like computation, etc. Methods for fundamental analysis to value assets are not yet agreed upon or well developed, and the approaches that do exist vary depending on the type of crypto asset. You have to consider the trustworthiness of counterparties like exchanges, public figures in the media, informational sites and wallets. And there are frequent, relatively abrupt events you have to work to stay abreast of: hard forks, airdrops, regulatory developments (domestic and international), partnerships, new listings on exchanges, changes to algorithms and security vulnerabilities. Navigating all of this is incredibly laborious and risky. While many enthusiasts navigate these details either professionally or as a passion, it's a huge barrier to most. If you’re looking to make a 1 to 5 percent allocation of your portfolio into crypto, as many new to the space now are, it’s just not feasible. Returns That's not to say there aren't solutions. In response to this combination of interest and obstacles, 2017 has been an unparalleled year of new investment vehicles and services seeking to abstract away the complexities. New vehicles have spanned the gamut: actively managed crypto asset hedge funds, futures, single coin investment trusts, passive index funds, funds of funds and dozens of applications for exchange-traded products. Several custodians are working to help non-crypto asset-only funds buy and store crypto assets. And many wallets and exchanges are now offering the ability to trade additional coins. Above all else, though, 2017 was the year of new actively managed crypto asset hedge funds. Morgan Stanley Research estimates there were over 84 new funds formed this year, up from 11 in 2016, managing an estimated $2 billion in capital. Some crypto asset hedge funds are focused on ICOs, some on active trading, some on picking the best long positions. At a high level, all are focused on delivering exposure to crypto assets and abstracting away the complexities of participating directly. According to the HFR Cryptocurrency Index, which tracks the performance of active crypto asset hedge funds, these funds averaged over 1,600% return on the year as of November, before fees. This compares to over 850% for bitcoin, over 6,500% for ether and over 1,200% for the HOLD 10 Index, our product that offers exposure to the 10 largest coins over the same period. Looking ahead to 2018, if demand sustains itself, we will continue to see growth in the number and variety of vehicles and services seeking to provide exposure to crypto assets while handling the complexities for investors. That will mean both more of the vehicles and services we’ve seen already, as well as new approaches. Think a certain crypto asset is bound for success in 2018?

coindesk	2017s-crypto-revolution-just-beginning	2017's Crypto (R)evolution Was Just the Beginning - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T00:30	Bobby Cho is head of global trading at Cumberland, where he oversees one of the largest cryptocurrency and digital asset trading operations. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review. When we kicked off this year, bitcoin had just topped $1,000 for the first time in three years. It was a signal to the market, but cryptocurrency still lacked serious interest from mainstream banks and institutional investors. Today, we’re looking at a very different market and, as one of the largest liquidity providers in the space, Cumberland has had a front row seat to the evolution — or revolution, depending on your perspective. Over the last several years, anyone who was following cryptocurrency or involved at all in the markets alluded that "Wall Street" was coming. This was the year we actually saw this start to happen, driven by the new ventures, burgeoning demand and market maturation that generally accompany a rapid run up in price. Real dollars are put to work 2017 was an inflection point. We saw a shift from getting familiar with cryptocurrencies to putting real dollars to work — a shift from education to action that was evident throughout the activity we saw in the crypto markets. Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies saw their valuations grew consistently over the first half of the year and, as we entered the back half of the year, prices reached all-time highs over and over again, with year-over-year market cap figures growing over 4,000%. The end-of-the-year headlines are telling the story of volatility (those of us who have been in these markets for some time know that volatility defines them — and, indeed, all nascent markets), but the fact remains we've seen prices up 1500% this year. And demand to invest real, new money has followed. Realizing that bitcoin is here to stay, CME, CBOE and Nasdaq all announced plans to list bitcoin futures contracts, with a race to get the first product listed. CME and CBOE have already launched and have active market participants. Historically, adding derivatives to a spot market has been an indication of maturity, and we see these contracts as a natural progression in the expansion of bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) as an asset class. These developments also signal that action will only continue, as futures have been a known precursor to an ETF — and NYSE and CBOE have both announced plans to list. Futures and ETFs are familiar to institutional money, and many investors who have been on the sidelines are using these products to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. Market players change face Bitcoin has always had a diverse group of followers, historically made up of early adopters, crypto-centric companies, individual traders, high net-worth individuals and a small group of institutional traders like Cumberland. But it's the birth of the crypto-specific hedge fund that has really signaled a trend from education to action among institutional capital. At Cumberland, we saw these funds emerge this year in truly meaningful numbers, from a handful in 2016 to around 70 in the middle part of this year to now more than 120 and growing, a figure which represents approximately 1 percent of all hedge funds globally. We’re seeing everything from early crypto-enthusiasts who did well for themselves now running funds to the more established funds turning their full-time focus on cryptocurrencies. From our perspective, it’s a trend that shows no signs of slowing down in 2018. We're also seeing the changing face of the cryptocurrency investor reflected in the shifting landscape between early crypto movers — let’s call them bitcoin 1.0 — and newer users or bitcoin 2.0. Both groups are ultimately trying to achieve the same goal – making bitcoin scalable, secure and usable, and making it the largest decentralized network for the movement of value. We have seen some significant developments over the last year which brought about different solutions, with one ultimately creating bitcoin cash. It remains to be seen which philosophy will come out on top and what that means for the continued mainstreaming of the asset. Ecosystem builds on bitcoin We also saw a shift this year as the interest in bitcoin gave rise to interest in other cryptocurrencies, with a cottage industry of new products and services emerging around them. As people embraced bitcoin and ether, other cryptocurrencies began to attract investors, which eventually led capital into different and diverse projects. If you didn’t like certain attributes of bitcoin for whatever reason, other tokens and protocols were more readily available in 2017 than ever before, and this demand came sooner than was really expected. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies that exist today for a wide array of utilities and use cases, and over the last year, we have seen an increase in demand for these cryptocurrencies. We believe that an overall interest in decentralized technologies, community investment and collaboration, and the dramatic increase in the market capitalization of the crypto ecosystem have all fueled this acceleration. This year's action also gave rise to ICOs, an entirely new layer to the ecosystem. We've seen the number of ICO white papers increase dramatically over the last year as entrepreneurs look to fund a dizzying array of projects. According to Icodata.io, the number of funds raised increase by over 6,000% and the number of deals issued increase by over 2,500% year-over-year. Action to adoption If 2017 was about education turning to action, 2018 is about action turning to adoption. 2018 could set the stage for white papers converting into production-grade products. Right now, investors are still exploring what their strategy will ultimately be — despite the giant increase in demand this year, a lot of it was more dipping a toe in than making a big splash. Looking at the year ahead, we expect to see the institutional capital magnified, with cryptocurrencies more fully established as an asset class. More crypto-funds popping up, more institutions making crypto a key part of their strategy, more jurisdictions providing regulatory clarity. And to be clear, many of the ideas and projects in the marketplace will fail, but may give rise to better developed ideas and projects down the line. While it's still early days and no one knows with certainty how this will all play it, I expect it will be fascinating ride — and Cumberland is looking forward to being here at every step.

coindesk	2018s-challenge-promote-responsible-blockchain-innovation	2018's Challenge: Promote Responsible Blockchain Innovation - CoinDesk	2018-01-19T13:00	Beth Knickerbocker is chief innovation officer at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the U.S. agency that charters, regulates and supervises all national banks. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review. Innovation in financial services is critical to meeting the nation's changing consumer and business needs, and the OCC's Office of Innovation is working to promote responsible innovation in the federal banking system. Operational since January 2017, the Office of Innovation is responsible for improving the agency's ability to identify, understand and respond to financial innovation affecting the federal banking system and serves as the agency’s central point of contact and clearinghouse for innovation-related matters. Early last year, the Office hosted "Office Hours" in technology hubs New York and San Francisco with more than 40 banks and non-banks to gain a better understanding of common issues and concerns that these entities face regarding innovation-related products, services, and emerging technologies. The goal of the meetings was to provide these entities with candid regulatory advice and give participants a welcoming environment in which to express their views. Other topics discussed at these informal meetings included partnering with banks, third-party risk management expectations and how best to prepare to operate in a highly-regulated environment. Action points A dedicated web page was established on OCC.gov with links to innovation guides for community banks, financial technology companies (for example, marketplace lenders and startups in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency space), and other non-bank institutions. The page describes the OCC's Responsible Innovation Framework and provides links to innovation-related news, speeches, and special purpose national bank charter information. Banks, non-bank companies, and fintech companies can contact the office through a dedicated e-mail address or phone number. In addition to Office Hours, the OCC participated in more than 50 outreach events related to fintech and responsible innovation. Additional outreach and awareness efforts included collaborating and sharing information with other domestic and international regulators. Internally, the Office conducts research, develops awareness materials, and maintains a library of fintech and innovation-related news articles, podcasts, and other resources. This material is available to the OCC workforce so that examiners, in particular, are prepared to discuss innovation topics with bankers and to answer questions about the OCC's responsible innovation efforts. The Office is also working with the OCC's Continuing Education department on updating training plans to help OCC staff learn more about responsible innovation. In March 2017, the OCC published a draft supplement to the Comptroller’s Licensing Manual describing its proposed approach to chartering fintech companies. The draft supplement clarifies the agency's approach to evaluating national bank charter applications from fintech companies, describes how it would supervise these banks and articulates expectations for how these banks would ensure fair access and fair treatment for all customers. To date, the OCC has not decided whether to exercise its authority to grant special purpose national bank charters to non-depository fintech companies under 12 CFR 5.20(e)(1). In a July speech to the Exchequer Club, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika made clear that fintech companies can seek national bank charters under other authorities used to charter full-service banks, as well as other, long-established special-purpose national banks, such as trust banks, banker's banks, and Competitive Equality Banking Act (CEBA) credit card banks. Outlook Looking ahead to 2018, the OCC is considering developing a program for the OCC to participate in bank pilots to further the its understanding of innovative products, services, processes, or technologies. A program such as this may accomplish the same goals as what others call "sandboxes," and allow the OCC to foster responsible innovation by OCC-supervised banks and enable participants to obtain OCC feedback early in the development process. Information gathered in the pilots could also inform OCC policies and ensure that we are ready to supervise the new activity when implemented on a larger scale. Pilots, however, do not provide a safe harbor from banks' compliance responsibilities. Also in 2018, the OCC will expand its Office Hours program to other financial innovation hubs, build on its outreach and research efforts, and improve the awareness and knowledge of OCC staff on emerging trends in the industry. The OCC will continue to identify ways to promote and support banks interested in engaging in responsible innovation by partnering with fintechs and other non-bank companies in a safe and sound manner, reducing costs and increasing earnings, and serving their customers more effectively.

Yet, while tech giants give us access to the stuff we like – music, movies, shopping – blockchain enthusiasts think an individual's web experience could be greatly improved by decentralization. If the web's giants decentralize, the web itself will become a wildly different place – it's hard to even wrap your head around, just like it would have been impossible to imagine meme culture in 1999. Today, a site and its database are one entity. In the decentralized version, the database doesn't belong to its creators; it belongs to its community, and that community can build lots of different business models on top of the database. Think of it like this: if the web had been decentralized from the beginning, you could have made your first social media profile on Friendster in 2003. Then, when MySpace came along, you wouldn't need to create a new profile, you'd just give MySpace permission to access the one you had already made for Friendster. Same thing for Facebook. Obviously, each new site would add new features and ways of interacting, but users would not have needed to start over, lose friends from other sites or the content created on prior platforms. Are those advantages strong enough to upend the Dot-Com era's familiar incumbents? Entrepreneurs and the various investors who have committed capital – whether that be in the form of traditional venture capital, or perhaps more common in the space today, through initial coin offerings (ICOs) – have made their bets that it is. And with ICOs providing not only a new fundraising mechanism for these blockchain startups, but also a tool for users to interact with these new distributed networks, the underlying infrastructure for a new internet – a "web 3.0" – is growing. Below are three verticals on the web that blockchain startups are aiming to take market share from through the use of crypto tokens. Eliminating eBay? eBay logo image via Shutterstock While eBay is an internet O.G., in the early days of the web, there were also other sites built around specific products, such as comic books, where sellers sold directly to buyers. One might imagine that focused marketplaces would naturally provide a better customer experience, but eBay, which offered an array of different products, proved that wrong. It turned out that it was better to sell comic books on the site that also sold bicycle parts, because someone might come looking for one and end up buying both. On top of that, it was just easier to remember one site for buying used stuff, rather than many. While there's nothing stopping a seller from offering one product on both a specialized site and a general site, such as eBay, it would take sophisticated software to make sure the same item didn't get sold twice, and eBay doesn't want to make that kind of thing easy. But what if consumers could have both? What if the comic books, for example, lived in the same database as the all the other products, but different websites could be built around that data? In that way, a listing could show up in a variety of marketplaces, but if one listing sold on any one marketplace, it would show as sold on all of them. That's possible, according to Gee Chuang, the CEO of Listia, an existing marketplace that's developing a decentralized version of eBay called Ink Protocol: "Ink Protocol's vision is to decentralize peer-to-peer marketplaces, taking the power away from the companies that run them and giving it back to the buyers and sellers. As a result, more value is distributed back to the actual user." In an effort to create this system, Listia plans to sell $15 million worth of crypto tokens, starting on Jan. 29. Listia will also seed early users of its existing marketplace, where people already earn Listia credits for trading items peer-to-peer, with the token. Listia credits will convert into the crypto tokens as the blockchain network launches. It's a similar goal to OB1's OpenBazaar, one of the longest-running and most popular decentralized marketplaces, except that OB1 is also focused on making it easier for users to transact anonymously, and has only used bitcoin for transacting. Yet, that could soon change, as OB1's CEO Brian Hoffman announced at Token Summit II recently that that company would be pursuing a token offering in response to increased congestion on the bitcoin network. Speaking to the benefits of a decentralized marketplace, Listia's Chuang said, "Sellers in decentralized marketplaces have the freedom to use any platform they like at any time, while bringing that hard-earned reputation with them everywhere they go." Move over YouTube YouTube image via Shutterstock YouTube is the number one place in the world to share and search for video. While the site has created a new career path for content creators, the tensions between those creators and its central administrators have become heated. Content creators suffer as YouTube decreases its revenue share with video makers and uses automation to pull advertisements from their videos if they suspect the video displays offensive or inappropriate behavior, catching some suitable videos in its wide net. Consumers, meanwhile, complain that advertisements are becoming too prevalent on the site in general. A new generation of startups believes decentralizing their platforms will allow content creators to interact directly with their audiences with the use of a crypto token. At the same time, users will get more choice in how their attention can be monetized – they can view ads, release personal information or even contribute part of their computing power to the operation of the system. "Bittorrent — with more than 250 million users worldwide — has been already proven to be capable of delivering good quality content in a decentralized and compelling manner," said Adrian Garelik, CEO of Flixxo, a decentralized video sharing platform that closed its token sale in November. Released in 2001, Bittorrent works by connecting users to copies of content held on other people's devices, rather than a centralized server system. And Garelik envisions making the torrent network more robust by giving people more incentive to host content by earning cryptocurrency. "By creating this incentivized network, any kind of content could be distributed in a peer-to-peer fashion, with a lot of monetization possibilities," Garelik said. According to Flixxo creators, users of peer-to-peer file sharing platforms have been in need of an effective peer-to-peer payment system to make the platforms more useful. And that seems to be a thought shared by a number of blockchain-based startups looking to decentralize file sharing, including Stream, Theta and Livepeer, each that has its own token. And that's not all of them – there are handfuls of players at each level of the online video stack. As explained by another decentralized video company Paratii in a blog post: "What we see forming is not a single pyramidal stack, where the choice of one piece of tech inevitably 'disables' another. Rather, what we have are protocol silos, with more or less interoperable layers." Disrupting Apple Music iTunes gift cards image via Shutterstock It's possibly taken years to purchase and download all that music that gets your heart racing when you're at the gym or mellows you out after a long day of work – the perfect soundtrack to your life. And just as special as all that is to you, those tastes are just as important to the companies that control the online music marketplaces where you get that music. That's because, as users participate in marketplaces like Apple Music, they build up their own intellectual property by creating playlists, following artists and flagging their favorite songs. And that data is lucrative for the marketplaces to track and control, so much so that they make it difficult to move those preferences to another service. According to Jesse Grushack from Consensys's Ujo, a blockchain-based music supply chain provider: "We are being locked into these systems controlled by corporate giants." And many startups, not just Ujo, agree. A handful of blockchain-based companies have started up looking to disrupt various layers of the music industry, including Viberate, which looks to eliminate the need for musicians' rent-seeking agents with smart contracts. Even more mainstream names are seeing potential benefits in adopting blockchain and cryptocurrency in the music biz. Icelandic singer Bjork announced in November that she'd be accepting four different cryptocurrencies for her forthcoming album, and a former Universal Music Group executive raised $1.2 million in October for a music-rights management platform called Blokur that uses the ethereum blockchain. While many of these platforms haven't announced crypto token sales, Grushack admitted that Ujo might issue a token down the road. Currently, though, the company is focused on the concept of a "portable fan badge" – a token-like instrument that links identity to data – so that as a fan, you could port what musicians, songs and genres you like across all different kinds of music marketplaces. In this way, Grushack said, the musician would really know a person is a fan, and could then market them new content directly. And not only that, but the portal is designed to make it easier for any number of parties to share rights, for example of one song, where each musician that participated gets paid out based on the work they put in. While this is technically possible today, the process would require a significant number of intermediaries who would all want to take a cut, making it worthless for artists today. "Right now Apple is in the process of phasing out purchases for music, so that leaves us in a scenario where everything we consume is in a rental model," Grushack said, adding: "If we did transition back into a system in which we bought music, being able to own that music and relationship regardless of the platform is something blockchain enables." Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blokur, Livepeer and OB1.

coindesk	90-crypto-mobile-apps-trouble-security-report-claims	90% of Crypto Mobile Apps 'In Trouble,' Security Report Claims - CoinDesk	2017-11-29T04:55	The vast majority of mobile cryptocurrency wallet apps employ poor security. Or so claims new research from San Francisco security firm High-Tech Bridge based on an analysis of more than 2,000 apps on Google Play. Of the first 30 crypto apps with up to 100,000 total installations, 93 percent contain at least three "medium-risk" vulnerabilities and 90 percent contain at least two "high-risk" issues. Among the most-downloaded apps, the numbers are a little better, but not by much. Ninety-four percent of apps with over 500,000 installations contain at least three "medium-risk" vulnerabilities and 77 percent contain at least two high-risk vulnerabilities. The most common vulnerabilities, according to the analysis, include "insecure data storage," which means information that should be private can leak unintentionally, and "insufficient cryptography," which indicates some form of cryptography was implemented to shield data, but was used incorrectly. In short, this means users might be at risk. "Depending on the application functionality, design and vulnerabilities, a wide spectrum of nuisances is possible, up to sensitive data and even the wallet (private key) theft," said Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and founder of High-Tech Bridge. He added: "Unfortunately, I am not surprised with the outcomes of the research." Kolochenko attributes the poor scores to a lack of emphasis on security across mobile development. "For many years, cybersecurity companies and independent experts were notifying mobile app developers about the risks of 'agile' development that usually imply no framework to assure secure design, secure coding and hardening techniques or application security testing," he added. Users and developers can use the company's free security analysis tool, Mobile X-Ray, to plug in mobile apps and see the vulnerabilities for themselves. However, when it comes to securing funds, there's plenty that can go wrong. The tech firm implies that its own research doesn't go far enough. Its analysis, for instance, only looks at the frontend of the apps, and there could be other problems in the backend. The report remarks: "This is just the tip of the iceberg."

coindesk	a-new-blockchain-etf-is-up-for-sec-approval	A New Blockchain ETF Is Up for SEC Approval - CoinDesk	2017-11-29T10:06	Horizons ETFs Management has filed for a new blockchain exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC filing, dated Nov. 22, reveals that the Horizons Blockchain Index will invest at least 80 percent of its total assets in the common stock of the companies that are included in the fund. The index will invest in U.S. and foreign equity securities and companies that participate in "the adoption and integration" of blockchain technology. The prospectus states: "The [ETF] is an index fund that employs a 'passive management' investment strategy in seeking to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, generally correspond to the performance of the Horizons Blockchain Index." Horizons ETFs Management will track the index using "a replication strategy", the filing indicates – that is, it will invest in common stock in the index generally in proportion to its weighting. Further it hopes to accrue profits from companies "companies poised to grow due to blockchain." Earlier this month, two other ETF specialists also filed with the SEC for blockchain-related vehicles. In its filing, Reality Shares Advisors revealed its plans to work with Nasdaq to offer securities for different blockchain companies. Amplify Trust ETF also filed for permission to invest and trade in blockchain startups.

coindesk	aia-aig-join-b3i-blockchain-consortium-adds-23-members	AIA and AIG Join B3i as Blockchain Consortium Adds 23 Members - CoinDesk	2017-10-02T22:00	Major insurance groups AIG and AIA are among 23 new members of the B3i blockchain insurance consortium. The new slate of entrants was unveiled earlier today, drawing in members from Asia, the Middle East and North America, among other regions. B3i initially launched in October of last year, backed by a group of notable European-based insurers that included Allianz, Aegon, Swiss Re and more. All told, the group now counts more than three dozen insurers and reinsurers amongst its ranks. The companies join just as B3i prepares to begin testing a jointly developed platform focused on catastrophic insurance contracts, a process scheduled to begin later this month. Other projects being pursued by the consortium include a smart contract tool designed to streamline administrative work done by counter-parties to insurance contracts, as well as work that will see members "developing and prototyping further use cases during 2018 for market adoption." "In less than a year B3i has become truly global, both in terms of the work we are undertaking and the companies we represent. We look forward to working with the new entrants who will take part in our market testing, and to learning from each other's expertise and experience," said Paul Meeusen, ‎head of finance and treasury services for Swiss Re and a co-founder of the consortium.

coindesk	aim-fire-bulletproofs-breakthrough-privacy-blockchains	Aim, Fire: Bulletproofs Is a Crypto Privacy Breakthrough - CoinDesk	2018-01-02T14:00	There's a new privacy technology in the crypto Wild West, and if the rate at which it's winning favor from developers is any sign, it's one to watch. Called "bulletproofs," the new invention by University College of London's Jonathan Bootle and Stanford's Benedikt Bunz was announced last month, and quickly developers from major blockchains took steps to implement the code. Created initially for use on bitcoin, bulletproofs are already being adapted for monero and mimblewimble, and litecoin's creator has said its blockchain, one of the 10 largest, may follow suit. And the reason for the interest is that bulletproofs is believed to offer something of a rarity in the cryptocurrency sector, code that is both simple for blockchains to execute and powerful in the way it boosts privacy. While part of a public blockchain's appeal doubtless lies in the transparency it provides (enabling, say, more auditable financial markets), this attribute isn't always desirable, especially when users want to transact privately or enterprises need some level of confidentiality between partners. Reflecting on the hype, Bunz told CoinDesk that while some of the cryptography underlying bulletproofs has been in use since the 1970s, new advancements are allowing it to be applied to cryptocurrency systems. "If there wasn't a clear application in mind, the time and resources would have been devoted to something else," Bunz said, continuing: "It's a lucky and good marriage of these two timelines working together. The killer application and the technology are meeting each other. The killer application is the money application." Behold, bulletproofs Based on a technology called confidential transactions, bulletproofs' most notable feature may be that it minimizes computational excess. Instead of obscuring the entirety of a blockchain, bulletproofs only conceals the quantities sent within a transaction – the sender and recipient's address are still visible, but the amount being sent is not. And while it's not total anonymity, the confidentiality added with bulletproofs can be handled by already operational blockchains, said Bunz. "I wouldn’t want my salary to be made public, and if you run a business you don't want to say publicly how much you're paying your supplier," Bunz said, adding: "I don't think you have to be a idealist to see that confidentially for money is basically a requirement." There could be other derivative benefits as well. For example, according to reports from the monero developement team, the use of bulletproofs could reduce transaction fees (another hot topic as blockchain fees continue to rise ) for private transactions by up to 80 percent. On top of this, the more bulletproof transactions you verify at once, the cheaper the process gets, Bunz told an audience at a lecture in UCL, pointing out that this could mean it works even better when used with existing privacy tech like " CoinJoin " – a popular piece of code that today fuses transactions together. But it's not just the lightweight confidentiality that makes bulletproofs so attractive. It's also in the fact that the tech doesn't require trust in others, like zcash's zk-snarks tech does (the reason for its elaborate generation ceremonies ). And, while the trusted setup is getting increasingly more secure, the process is still much criticized. For bulletproofs, the real cause for celebration is perhaps that developers don't seem to have found any issues with it. Speaking to CoinDesk, anonymous researcher for the Monero Research Lab, Surang Noether described bulletproofs as a "net win on all fronts" for cryptocurrency. Echoing that sentiment, Bunz told CoinDesk: "It's just better. It's shorter, more efficient, three times faster – it's better than the old system in every way." Testing continues That said, bulletproofs technology is still young and nascent, and while other blockchain developers are interested in adding it to their tech stacks, it won't see implementation on bitcoin anytime soon. On Reddit, co-author of the bulletproofs white paper and bitcoin developer Peter Wuille said its still "far too premature" to propose the tech's inclusion in bitcoin. Adding to that, another co-author of the white paper, Andrew Poelstra, wrote on a mailing list that the tech is still not ready for a "serious proposal to get anywhere." And speaking to CoinDesk, mimblewimble's lead developer, Ignotus Peverell, agreed with the hesitation, saying that the tech should be deployed and tested in the wild, on smaller platforms like monero or mimblewimble before high-profile blockchains like bitcoin should add the feature. Still, according to Peverell: "We're a lot closer to that goal [of private transactions] now, than we were before bulletproofs."

coindesk	allianz-unveils-blockchain-prototype-self-insurance-products	Allianz Unveils Blockchain Prototype for Self-Insurance Products - CoinDesk	2017-11-07T19:00	Global insurer Allianz has unveiled a new blockchain prototype focused on "captive" insurance policies. The prototype, the firm announced today, is aimed at providing a more streamlined approach for captive or self-insurance policies. With this type of product, a company will essentially insure themselves and their subsidiaries versus a more traditional policy purchase. Per Allianz, the complexities involved in this process – which can cover multiple jurisdictions – make the strong case for a more distributed solution. According to Allianz, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions handled the payment process involved with the insurance. The prototype utilized the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 software, which was published by the Linux Foundation-backed consortium of enterprises in July. Hartmut Mai, a board member for AGCS, said in a statement: "We are currently seeing many blockchain applications in the financial services industry and we are eager to explore the potential of this exciting technology in the corporate insurance segment." The prototype's unveiling is the latest indication that Allianz sees a potentially positive role for the tech within its services. Allianz has been testing blockchain use cases as early as 2015, when it revealed that it had brought in a blockchain startup within one of its accelerator programs. Since then, the insurance giant has experimented with applications in areas such as catastrophe bond trading.

coindesk	amazon-user-orders-bitcoin-miner-gets-boss-baby-dvd-instead	Amazon User Orders Bitcoin Miner, Gets 'Boss Baby' DVD Instead - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T22:45	A U.K. resident tried to purchase a bitcoin miner off of Amazon last year – but received a DVD copy of an animated film instead. As reported by local media including The Herald, Plymouth resident Ichim Bogdan Cezar was trying to buy a Bitmain AntMiner S9 at a cost of about $5,000. Yet rather than receiving his bitcoin mining hardware in the mail, he found a copy of the 2017 film The Boss Baby. Cezar, who has reportedly since received a refund from Amazon, reached out to the hardware seller and ultimately Amazon customer support. And though he was eventually granted a refund, per a report from The Herald, that didn't come until January. He told The Herald that the issue was both stressful and annoying, due to how much money he had spent on the miner. "Obviously it’s great that they will finally process a refund for me but it shouldn’t have taken that long, especially when there is such a big amount of money involved." Amazon finally refunded Cezar the full amount of the machine in late January, along with several other customers who reported similar occurrences. Minifigures Direct Ltd’s page on Amazon has multiple negative reviews noting the lack of Antminer deliveries, with several users complaining about receiving a Sharpie marker, Scotch tape or a pen instead of the machine customers ordered. However, the company does not seem to have any items listed for sale as of press time.

coindesk	angellists-naval-ravikant-token-summit-bitcoin-solves-money-problems	Naval Ravikant: Bitcoin Solves 'Money Problems' - CoinDesk	2017-12-06T18:00	Bitcoin's eye-popping price movements have some observers saying the market is in bubble territory. But while he's not ruling it out entirely, Naval Ravikant, the co-founder of AngelList, holds a less alarmist view. "Money is a bubble that never pops," he said at yesterday's Token Summit II in San Francisco. He told attendees: "It's a consensus hallucination." And speaking to the newfound attention to bitcoin, Ravikant said people are interested in growing the wealth that they have. With most savings accounts returning zero these days – as central banks conduct what Ravikant called their "grand money printing experiment" – the general public is looking for alternative places to store their money and watch it grow. Bitcoin and other protocols seem to offer that, as even the less-developed cryptocurrencies are showing substantial returns. "I think people are looking to solve their money problems," he said. Yet at the same time, he warned that some of the cryptocurrency industry has been overhyped. In particular, Ravikant believes the market puts way too much faith in the concept of decentralization. "One indicator we are in a very frothy environment is we have a lot of tokens trading at very high values that are junk," he said, without specifically naming any. "Right now, I think the market isn't distinguishing quality." Having said that though, Ravikant concluded that the cryptocurrency economy is here to stay. In fact, he gave the audience some insight into what cryptocurrencies he's interested in. These include bitcoin, for storing value; zcash, for transacting easily; basecoin, to act as a stable unit of account; and tezzies, to access the Tezos smart contract platform. "I think we'll see a lot more of the money use cases realized," he predicted, adding: "If you can redefine what money is, that's a trillion-dollar outcome." Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company, the for-profit entity that develops the zcash protocol.

coindesk	antpool-adds-support-for-siacoin-mining-amid-bitmain-miner-launch	Antpool Adds Support for Siacoin Mining Amid Bitmain Miner Launch - CoinDesk	2018-01-18T14:45	AntPool, one of the largest cryptocurrency mining pools, has announced it will now support the siacoin token. The announcement of AntPool mining support comes alongside the news that China's mining chip giant Bitmain, which owns AntPool, has launched a new mining hardware device, dubbed the AntMiner A3. Data shows that, currently, AntPool accounts for 18 percent of the global bitcoin hashing power. Siacoin is the native token of the sia blockchain, developed by Boston-based blockchain startup Nebulous to support its decentralized cloud storage system. According to Bitmain, the new 815 GH/s miner supports the "blake2b" hashing algorithm, which is also used to secure the siacoin blockchain. However, the launch appears to be not well-received by at least one member of the siacoin development team. One representative, going by the pseudonym "Taek42" on Reddit, argued that Bitmain might put profit ahead of the sia ecosystem. Taek42 added that the sia blockchain could be changed to block mining via the AntMiner A3, but that it would require a soft fork to do so. While some agreed with Taek42's sentiment, others welcomed the addition of Bitmain to the sia arena. "Bitmain selling a Sia miner is great for the price of the coin, it brings us into the mainstream," wrote JoWi96 on Reddit. As of press time, Bitmain had not responded to a request for comment.

coindesk	apple-patent-filing-hints-blockchain-timestamp-use	Apple Patent Filing Hints at Blockchain Use - CoinDesk	2017-12-07T17:35	A new patent application from U.S. electronics giant Apple points to the potential use of blockchain within a prospective system for creating and verifying timestamps. In an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, Apple details a program able to certify timestamps by combining aspects of blockchain technology with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) tools. The use case in question involves tying a piece of information to a particular transaction on a blockchain, establishing the state of that data at a particular point in time. Should that information be changed, additional transactions can be created that detail changes to the data. Apple's application describes three possible methods for establishing timestamps, with one of these scenarios centering around a blockchain platform. The program would generate a block containing a timestamp, with every subsequent block being added as miners verify each transaction conducted on the chain. This system is part of what Apple is calling a "multi-check architecture," meaning that another system would confirm the timestamp after the block is generated but before it is added to the chain. According to the application, Apple would consider using a blockchain due to the decentralized security features it offers. As the document notes: “If any party attempts to alter a node some time earlier in the blockchain, each hash puzzle solution for block subsequent to the altered block becomes broken or incorrect.

coindesk	arsenal-football-club-signs-deal-to-promote-igaming-firms-ico	Arsenal Football Club to Promote iGaming Firm ICO - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T10:40	iGaming platform provider CashBet has partnered with Arsenal Football Club in a deal that will promote the firm's new crypto token. The British Premier League team's sponsorship deal with the iGaming platform provider is claimed to be the first collaboration between a major sports team and a cryptocurrency provider. The agreement will see the company's new token, CashBet Coin, being advertised at Arsenal's Premier League home games at the Emirates Stadium in London, while CashBet can use the Arsenal brand across its ICO promotions. CashBet CEO and founder Dr. Mike Reaves said in a press release yesterday: "With our ICO for CashBet Coin, we are actively targeting a global, multi-billion dollar marketplace of iGaming content providers, operators and players.We are delighted to do so in partnership with one of world football's true giants in Arsenal, enabling us to build our brand and engage this audience in a meaningful way." CashBet Coin is intended for use across the company's gaming platform and the company hopes the sale will raise between $40 million–$70 million. The ICO presale kicked off yesterday and will end on Feb. 20 unless the hard cap is reached before that date. The public sale will be held from March 20 to April 27. Reaves explained in a different release that the introduction of the token will enable operators to solve major problems facing cryptocurrency-based casinos: "speed, trust, and cost." Integrating blockchain into the CashBet platform will open new markets by "democratizing access" for a new group of users currently underserved by the banks, he continued. Further, the addition of the token is expected to make the platform more scalable and cost-efficient.

coindesk	as-bitcoins-slide-continues-prices-look-towards-8k	As Bitcoin's Slide Continues, Prices Look Towards $8K - CoinDesk	2018-01-17T13:00	Bitcoin looks like it might soon test near-$8,000 levels, as December's record-breaking rally continues to unravel. With major losses over the last few days seemingly brought about by negative regulatory news from China and South Korea, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $10,280 levels at time of writing, according to Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index. A slight recovery from the 1.5-month low of $10,064 hit yesterday ran out of steam at $11,698 at 00:20 UTC today, and price once more started to drop. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 14.35 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data provider CoinMarketCap. With the indicators still all in bearish territory, the technical charts indicate scope for a drop close to $8,000 levels. Bitcoin chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows: Bitcoin closed (as per UTC) well below the Dec. 30 low of $12,500 yesterday, marking a bearish breakdown. Bitcoin has breached the support of the ascending trendline (drawn from Sep. 15 low and Nov. 12 low). The 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) carry a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards). The relative strength index (RSI) also remains bearish. The above technical factors clearly favor a further drop towards $8,690 – the support of the trendline sloping upwards from Jul. 16 low and Sep. 15 low. However, the bears are struggling to take bitcoin below $10,313 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 rally) in a convincing manner, and yesterday's dip below that level was short-lived. As for today, prices quickly recovered from the $10,070 (intraday low) to above $10,313. 4-hour chart As seen in the chart above, yesterday's long-legged doji candle was accompanied by a surge in trading volumes, indicating strong dip demand at $9,928 (doji candle low). View The broader outlook remains bearish as indicated by the daily chart. Prices look set to test $8,690–$8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 rally) in the next few days. A close (as per UTC) today below $10,313 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would boost the odds of a convincing break below $9,928 (4-hour doji candle low) and a slide towards $8,690–$8,052 levels. However, a brief recovery to $13,000 levels cannot be ruled out, courtesy of the strong dip demand below $10,000 and an oversold RSI on the 4-hour chart. Bullish reversal scenario: Only a close above the descending trend line (drawn from Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) would signal a bullish trend reversal and open the doors for $20,000.

coindesk	asx-says-yes-securities-exchange-approves-dlt-replacement-post-trade-system	ASX Says Yes: Stock Market to Settle Trades with DLT - CoinDesk	2017-12-06T22:21	The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has announced that it will replace its CHESS post-trade settlement system using technology developed by blockchain startup Digital Asset. After two years of building proofs of concept, working with potential users and testing the implementation, the much-anticipated decision represents a key milestone, as ASX is set to become the first mainstream exchange in the world to migrate one of its core services to a blockchain-based system. Dominic Stevens, managing director and CEO of ASX, said in a statement: "We believe that using DLT to replace CHESS will enable our customers to develop new services and reduce their costs, and it will put Australia at the forefront of innovation in financial markets. While we have a lot more work still to do, today’s announcement is a major milestone on that journey." The platform developed by Digital Asset uses the technology in order to allow the mutualization of financial market data and processes across multiple market participants. It does this while maintaining confidentiality and scalability – both critical for market infrastructures. ASX also announced that the firm has taken up its pro-rata right to participate in Digital Asset's recently announced Series B financing. With this, the total amount raised by Digital Asset to date is over $115 million.

coindesk	atomic-action-will-2018-year-cross-blockchain-swap	Atomic Action: Will 2018 Be the Year of the Cross-Blockchain Swap? - CoinDesk	2018-01-11T05:00	What if there were no exchanges to hack? As a new generation of crypto users begin to invest in the technology, developers are growing concerned about its infrastructure. They've seen this happen before – new users enter the space attracted by big gains, then suddenly, a catastrophic failure, usually at the very exchanges designed to hold and custody those funds. But out of adversity, inspiration is taking hold, with high-profile coders turning their focus to atomic swaps, a concept that claims to allow for the direct, peer-to-peer transfer of cryptocurrencies across different blockchains. In the place of the vulnerable exchanges we use today, the idea behind atomic swaps is that these large repositories of customer money could be rendered obsolete by code. And seasoned blockchain developers like Alex Bosworth believe this is all too necessary, especially given that users today need to effectively give up custody of their assets if they choose to hold funds on exchanges. He told CoinDesk: "Putting users in control of their own private keys has the best aggregate track record for security despite individual cases of loss. Funds under centralized control on exchanges have led to the most massive security failures we've seen." Andrew Gazdecki, CEO and co-founder of Altcoin.io, which recently launched a beta wallet for atomic swapping between crypto tokens, describes the problem in similar terms, arguing that users should be empowered to hold their own private keys (the alphanumeric strings that allow users to unlock, access and spend their funds) without relying on others. "There are literally billions of dollars being held within these digital honeypots, and it's nearly impossible to find the perpetrators," he said. Early examples of atomic swaps technology emerged in various stages in 2017, and while there's disagreement as to the timeline they'll be available to the public, some believe 2018 will be their year. As Jameson Lopp, a BitGo software engineer, recently tweeted : "Nearly instant atomic swaps... are coming sooner than everyone thinks. Definitely not a year away, but mere months." Atomic swaps already? In some ways, atomic swaps are already here – depending on the kind of atomic swap you're looking to make. For instance, last year saw swaps between different blockchains built on similar code – the cryptocurrencies decred, litecoin and bitcoin – executed. Meanwhile, atomic swaps between cryptocurrency tokens on the same blockchain became more commonplace, with decentralized exchanges such as 0x and, as mentioned above, Altcoin.io, adding instant trades between tokens on ethereum compatible protocols. Cryptocurrencies running on blockchains with much different codebases, though, must rely on purpose-built tools to facilitate these kinds of transfers today. Toward this goal, a tool for exchanging zcash for bitcoin called ZBXCAT was developed last year. Described by co-developer Jay Graber as the "walkie-talkie of payments," the tool will soon be accompanied by a simplified web interface. Indeed, atomic swaps "could always be done manually," Graber said. However, because this requires a degree of technical skill, before atomic swaps see mainstream use, easier to use platforms will need to be developed. At the same time, Lightning Labs, a company devoted to promoting bitcoin's Lightning Network, recently conducted its first off-chain atomic swap on its test blockchain. Completed in November, the transaction saw litecoin and bitcoin swapped on an off-chain payment channel. Off-chain hurdles Off-chain atomic swaps of this type are highly anticipated since trading would be automatic, not reliant on the processing times of different blockchains, but the technology needed to implement off-chain atomic swaps – things like the Lightning Network and Raiden Network on ethereum – are still under development. Which is why some, like Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, are less optimistic about cross-blockchain atomic swaps. Stark recently discounted the hype, writing on a development channel, "Anyone telling people that Lightning swaps will be ready in months doesn't know what they're talking about." And in interview with CoinDesk, Stark said: "There's still a good amount of infrastructure to build." One website, swapready.net, provides a breakdown of how close each cryptocurrency is to supporting cross-chain atomic swap capabilities – and to date, there's very few that can interoperate. Mirroring Stark's sentiments, Philippe Castonguay, developer relations manager at 0x, which offers on-chain atomic swaps of tokens on ethereum, told CoinDesk that developers looking to create atomic swaps between vastly different protocols are faced with "a lot of challenges." The infrastructure needed to interface between bitcoin and ethereum, for example, is still in development, and "to make it even worse, these cross-chain platforms also need to solve some of the main problems other blockchains are trying to solve, such as scalability," Castonguay said. Still optimistic Yet, even with a lot a work still to do, many remain assured advances are close. Bosworth, whose work has focused mostly on developing applications for bitcoin's Lightning Network, for one, made his excitement about a new era public, tweeting : "The atomic age is coming, what cannot be swapped will be left behind." And Castonguay, whose work focuses on ethereum, also remains encouraged by the development happening within that ecosystem. Even if swaps between blockchains with different code bases prove cumbersome, he believes the blockchain could yield other solutions given the expansive capabilities of its code. "Eventually the ethereum blockchain will be able to communicate with other blockchains," he said. "Once this happens, all the different coins from different blockchains will be representable on the ethereum blockchain." For example, if bitcoin and ethereum blockchains can communicate with each other in a trustless way, then users could have an ERC-20 bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain, pegged one to one with bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain, he posited. Such short-term solutions, he thinks, could help advance the atomic swaps concept overhaul. Castonguay concluded: "I do believe it is possible that some blockchains might be able to interact with one another this year, but I think 2019 through 2021 would be a safer bet."

coindesk	australian-government-grants-8-million-for-blockchain-energy-pilot	Australian Government Grants $8 Million for Blockchain Energy Pilot - CoinDesk	2017-11-20T11:01	The Australian government has announced that it will provide over AU$8 million (around US$6 million) in grants for a blockchain-powered smart utilities project. The funding will see a grant of AU$2.57 million go directly to the project, which will be set up in the City of Fremantle. A futher AU$5.68 million will be provided via project partners including blockchain firm Power Ledger. According to the company's blog, the pilot has been set up to explore how cities can use blockchain technology and data analytics to power distributed energy and water systems. The trial is being conducted with academic and technology partners, including Curtin University, Murdoch University, LandCorp, CSIRO and Cisco. Curtin University is to oversee project management and carry out research supporting the trial. According Curtin's Prof. Greg Morrison: "We will develop a smart metering, battery storage and blockchain trading system to allow energy and water efficiencies between critical dispersed infrastructures that would otherwise have required physical co-location." Power Ledger, the post states, is providing a transactional platform for renewable assets, as well as the ownership model for the "precinct sized" battery. Image via Power Ledger The federal grants are being provided as part of the government's Smart Cities and Suburbs Program, with support also coming from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), Western Power, and the CRC for Low Carbon Living. The pilot is expected to commence within two months, and will last for two years, the post states.

coindesk	australias-commbank-plans-to-issue-a-bond-on-the-blockchain	Australia's CommBank Plans to Issue a Bond on the Blockchain - CoinDesk	2017-12-06T13:00	The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has revealed a plan to issue a bond over a blockchain system, possibly as soon as next year. Though few details were revealed, Sophie Gilder, CommBank's head of blockchain, said that the bond would be transferred and paid for over a blockchain-based system in collaboration with an unnamed major world issuer, according to ZDNet report. In comments made during the GMIC Sydney conference Tuesday, Gilder said that bank has been exploring blockchain use cases for more than four years and has completed 25 proofs-of-concept and trials aimed to address real-world business issues. CommBank, she continued, is eyeing the technology for equities, bonds, syndicated loans and other applications where it considers there are high levels of "friction." Gilder stated: "We think the platform we have built can make this more efficient." Earlier this year, as reported by CoinDesk, CommBank announced that it is developing a blockchain-based system for the sale of government bonds. The concept was tested by the Queensland Treasury Corporation, which acts as the Australian state’s central financing authority. Other institutions are also moving to adopt blockchain technology for bond issuance. This October, Russia's National Securities Depository said it had issued its first-ever live bond using blockchain. The financial instrument, a $10-million bond for shares in Russian telecom giant MegaFon, used smart contracts and the open-source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. And, in late 2016, French bank BNP also announced that it was exploring the technology for use in distributing instruments known as "mini-bonds."

coindesk	axa-using-ethereums-blockchain-new-flight-insurance-product	AXA Is Using Ethereum's Blockchain for a New Flight Insurance Product - CoinDesk	2017-09-13T17:50	French insurance giant AXA has launched a new flight delay insurance product that uses the public ethereum blockchain to store and process payouts. The product, called Fizzy, is being pitched as a "smart insurance" tool that flyers can use to insure their trips if their flight is delayed by two hours or more. As such, the product makes notable use of smart contracts, self-executing piece of code that triggers once certain conditions are met on a blockchain. According to AXA, ethereum's public blockchain plays two key roles here. It maintains an accessible record of the insurance contract itself within a smart contract, and serves as a mechanism for triggering the payment to the client once the two-hour mark is passed. AXA representative Jean-Baptiste Mounier told CoinDesk in an email: "The smart contract is the party that decides whether or not we should indemnify the policy holder and triggers a payment request to our system. The use of a smart contract to trigger claims will add trust in the insurer / policy holder relationship." Ultimately, AXA is positioning the product release as a way to build more transparency into the insurance process. "Building customer-oriented offers is our definite goal at AXA. By removing insurance exclusions and using an Ethereum smart contract to trigger indemnifications, we increase the level of trust our customers can have with AXA," he said. Looking ahead, AXA is weighing additional uses of the ethereum blockchain for the Fizzy offering. For now, insurance payouts from Fizzy are being made in government-issued currencies to the customer. However, AXA said that, in the future, it wants to denominate those payments in ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network. "In the future, we want to include payment and indemnification in ether, which will completely guarantee coded trust in the fact that indemnification will for sure take place (and the insurer will not be able to trick consumers, which is a fear some customers have)," Mounier explained.

coindesk	back-1500-bitcoin-cash-see-dip	Back at $1,500: Bitcoin Cash Could See Further Dip - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T15:35	Bitcoin cash (BCH) is trading on the back foot today, with technical analysis suggesting the market risks a bearish breakdown over the weekend. At press time, the cryptocurrency has depreciated by 7 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChinaFX. On Bitfinex, the largest market for BCH/USD trading, bitcoin cash fell to $1,479 today; its lowest level against the dollar since Jan. 17. As of writing, it is trading at $1,599. The development follows a sharp recovery from the Jan. 17 low of $1,343, which witnessed a follow-through buying in the subsequent days. However, the move ran out of steam at a high of $2,110 on Jan. 20 and BCH turned lower again, thus creating a lower high pattern (bearish pattern) on the charts. That said, the 7 percent drop seen today is largely in line with the weakness in other cryptocurrencies. For instance, BCH's rival bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 5 percent in the last 24 hours. Further, Ripple's XRP token and Stellar's XLM token are down 8 percent each, while ethereum's ETH cryptocurrency is down 2 percent. Bitcoin cash chart The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows: BCH is creating head and shoulders bearish reversal pattern. A close (as per UTC) below the neckline would confirm a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. 50-day MA has shed bullish bias (topped out). Falling channel marked by downward sloping trendlines representing lower highs and lower lows. The relative strength index also favors the bears. View Confirmation of head and shoulders breakdown (close below $1,398 - neckline support) would open doors for a drop to $1,100 (Nov. 29 low) and possibly to falling channel support seen sloping lower to $1,050 over the next few days. A violation there would expose support at $851.12 (Nov. 17 low). Meanwhile, the 50-day MA of $2,195 could be put to test if the bulls defend the neckline support and prices quickly move above $1,806 (Jan. 22 high). On a larger scheme of things, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $2,400 would revive the bull run. Such a move would confirm upside break of the falling channel pattern and could yield $2,900-$3,000.

coindesk	bank-blockchain-integration-challenge-overcome	Bank Blockchain Integration: A Challenge Overcome - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T14:00	John Whelan is b lockchain lab director at Banco Santander, where he specializes in the application of blockchains, distributed ledgers and smart contracts within the financial industry. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review. For the past couple of years, there has been an extraordinary amount of hype around the potential of blockchain (or more correctly distributed ledger technology ) to transform the banking industry. The reason for this hype is quite profound: DLT has given us the opportunity to rearchitect the financial industry. In the years ahead, we will move from a system of many banks with many ledgers (with all the associated reconciliation, central clearing parties, auditing, etc) to a simpler system of many banks but fewer ledgers where reconciliation is automatic. Central clearing parties may no longer be necessary and regulators will have a real-time view of the positions and risks across the industry. But this transition, if it finally happens, is going to take a long time, and the chief reason is simple: legacy bank infrastructure and the tens of billions of dollars that have already been spent on building that infrastructure. The core bank systems of today, designed with security in mind, are extremely robust and secure. But as a result, they sacrifice flexibility and aren't exactly friendly in how they communicate with other technologies. Luckily though, over the past several years, the APIs of core bank systems have been upgraded to be REST -compliant and some even support events and web sockets. So, integrating a DLT platform with a core bank system can be relatively straightforward even though the underlying DLT network topology, architecture and security considerations may still be a work in progress. Keeping it simple The key to any successful integration is to minimize complexity. Certain use cases and transaction processes (e.g. cross-currency swaps) are complex and touch upward of 20 computer systems. And although very promising for the application of DLT, they may not be the obvious place to start as we move forward with the first real-money pilots. Other transaction processes like cross-border payments are simpler, and it is these kinds of applications that are probably the closest to production. So, how do integrations work in practice? At Banco Santander, our Blockchain Lab starts by building a prototype to tackle a specific business problem on a particular DLT platform (ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, R3's Corda). In order to make the prototype as close as possible to the real thing, first we will build a limited core bank simulator that emulates the core bank systems for that particular application. Next, we will map out the process flow for the use case that we are building and then spend the next two to three months in a series of sprints that result in an application that is robust enough to demonstrate to the business. If the business leaders like what they see, they may support taking the application to the next phase: pilot. At Santander when we say "pilot," we mean running the application on real money systems, though at limited scale. (The pilot phase is when the bank's IT teams – corporate IT and ops, security, infrastructure – get involved.) Together, we will do an architecture and security review of the prototype application and figure out all the necessary modifications that will need to be made to plug it into the bank’s pre-production environment. But because we have already been building on core bank simulators, connecting to the real core bank systems becomes significantly easier. These pilot integrations have been taking us four to 12 weeks, depending on the amount of work involved. Once the pilot integrations have been done, performing a robust series of tests on a defined schedule is the next step. It is during these tests that bugs are identified and squashed. The chief concern here is maintaining atomicity between the core bank system and the blockchain. In other words, it is imperative that the numbers that are reflected in the core bank are exactly the same as the numbers that are present in the blockchain. In practice, though, this is not too difficult to achieve and the two systems play quite nicely with each other. Very nicely, in fact. A sample use case A good example of a hypothetical integration process might be the development of a killer app like digital cash (aka a "fiat-backed stablecoin" in industry parlance) that will support micropayments, pay-per-download of digital content and the natural extension of Internet of Things, the machine-to-machine economy. Digital cash as a concept is not new and has been tried before, starting with the original Ripple gateways in 2013 and followed by later attempts like BitAssets that involved backing the stablecoin with a non-fiat asset. More recent efforts like basecoin are at the white paper stage, with theoretical approaches to creating an algorithmically backed stablecoin. And, while we are waiting for central banks to issue digital versions of their own currencies (very possible, but unlikely to happen for quite some time) existing commercial banks could get the ball rolling. So, what integrations would be needed to deploy a fiat-backed stablecoin? First, we would have to identify the components and integration points needed for a simple tokenized digital cash system as follows: User wallet: The user registers his or her blockchain wallet with the digital cash platform. Know your customer(KYC) checks would be performed at this time. An integration with a KYC system is required. Escrow account: The account at the bank where the funds from all the different users are pooled. Segregation of those funds happens on the distributed ledger. Tokenizer: The interface between the core bank system and the blockchain. This application detects incoming transfers to the escrow account and creates the matching amount of digital tokens in the user’s wallet. It also handles redemptions of tokens and triggers their destruction and the corresponding transfer of real funds from the escrow account back to the user’s bank account. Transactions: These occur directly between user wallets on the blockchain. No integration as such is needed, although regulations may require that both wallets conduct KYC in advance and anti-money-laundering (AML) screening might be required for transactions above a certain size From a technical point of view, building a digital cash application is quite straightforward. Very few integrations with core bank systems are required. The "tokenizer" does most of the work, with KYC and AML being done off-chain if needed. Of course, there are many legal and regulatory challenges that will need to be overcome before bank-backed digital cash becomes a reality on public blockchains. But for blockchains, particularly smart contract platforms, to reach their true potential and become an integral part of the lives of the Earth's 7 billion people, enabling tokenized versions of real money is an essential step. Admittedly some of the technology is not quite ready to support digital cash at scale. But the good news is that from an integration point of view at least, creating a fiat-backed stablecoin might not be too difficult. In fact, it might be the easiest integration of all. Disagree?

coindesk	battle-testing-lightning-26-schools-start-contest-secure-bitcoins-layer-2	Battle-Testing Lightning: Schools Start Contest to Secure Bitcoin’s Layer 2 - CoinDesk	2018-01-20T11:30	While many see the Lightning Network as the main hope for bitcoin's scaling issues, it's unclear whether many developers are actually working to make that a reality. According to Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, there may be as few as 10 total full-time developers focused on implementations of the technology, something that's kept the network from launching sooner. Against this backdrop, a group of 26 universities known as the Bsafe.network have launched a contest to entice people to evaluate bitcoin's layer-two technologies, namely Lightning. Although the prize hasn't been named yet, the contest looks to entice engineers, students and professors to measure the security and privacy of the network and "collect attack models" that bad actors could use to disrupt payments going over the Lightning Network, a technology which is heralded as a way to scale bitcoin and potentially reduce fees. This extra boost in scrutiny comes at a time when users and developers are anxious for Lightning to launch for real. While Lightning Network developers recommend only using the technology on the testnet with dummy coins, a handful of eager users and developers have begun playing around with the technology with real bitcoin. Some of these intrepid testers have even lost a little money in the process. A few companies, such as VPN provider TorGuard, already accept Lightning Network payments. The competition is inspired by past successful contests to improve the cryptography standards commonly used across the internet to secure data, such as AES and SHA-3, said Bsafe.network co-founder and Georgetown University research professor Shin'ichiro Matsuo. And, he continued, Bsafe's global test network maintained by the universities will act as a neutral research body to analyze submissions for battle-testing Lightning Network. Matsuo told CoinDesk: "We think many enhancements of Lightning Network will come through this competition." Submissions for the contest, which is open to anyone, are due in March. Once all the proposals are in, the universities will test all of them on Bsafe's global test network, culminating in a conference in August where winners will be announced. Figuring it out Matsuo said he also hopes the submissions will shine a light on the security and privacy of the technology and how it will interact with the cryptocurrency's "layer one." Because no one can really know how the technology will be used or exploited at scale, this contest could help. By asking for proposals from all over the world, which will be analyzed by academics from a number of different countries and fields, Matsuo believes the competitive atmosphere will help to shed light on what the precise trade-offs are. "Layer-two technologies such as the Lightning Network are needed to enhance the scalability of payments over the bitcoin blockchain, but they might change the trust model, meaning Lightning Network might not be wholly decentralized," he told CoinDesk. Because of this, the technology has its fair share of critics, the strongest of whom contend it won't be decentralized in practice. The contest, then, is an effort to glean insights about the Lightning Network's strengths and weaknesses. Open competition And after the submissions are judged and awarded, the Bsafe.network plans to "disclose all of the evaluations" and open-source all the code so the bitcoin community can pick through it and learn from the results. But beyond improving the Lightning Network, Matsuo hopes Bsafe.network will have another broader impact on the bitcoin and blockchain industry. Matsuo wants this contest to be only the first of many and wants to grow the network of universities that are part of the group, in an effort to make its reach even more diverse. "With 26 universities and growing, doing this type of open competition gives us a neutral result to compare that kind of technology," he said. And if the group can convince the wider community of its neutrality, Matsuo hopes those engaged in fiery arguments – such as the block-size debate – in the community can turn to Bsafe for guidance based on tests. In his mind, the vitriol that many times comes from the debates is exacerbated by "communication issues" that a Bsafe.network could steer more productively by providing technical analysis. He concluded: "We already have this for cryptography, but for bitcoin and blockchain, we need a more neutral way of analyzing the technology."

coindesk	bear-grip-strengthens-as-bitcoin-price-nears-10k	Bear Grip Strengthens as Bitcoin Price Nears $10K - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T12:20	Having closed below a key long-term moving average yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) prices look set to explore sub-$10,000 levels. Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index fell to a low of $10,050.79 yesterday and dipped below $10,000 soon before publishing. At press time, BTC had bounced back to $10,150 levels. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 11.70 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChainFX. On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, BTC hit a five-day low of $10,025 yesterday. The sell-off gathered pace after prices breached strong support at $11,000 (confluence of 100-day moving average (MA) and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). Also, BTC closed (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA for the first time since July. Looking ahead, the price chart analysis favors a break to further below $10,000 levels. Bitcoin chart The above chart (prices per Coinbase) shows: The decline from the weekend high of $13,000 has left another lower highs (bearish) pattern on the daily chart. Further, prices closed below 100-day MA. Both likely reinforcing the bears. Prices closed (as per UTC) below $11,004 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $5,511.11 to $19,891.99), signaling potential for more losses ahead. The 50-day MA has topped out (has shed bullish bias). The 5-day MA and 10-day MA carry a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards). The bearish crossover between the 5-day MA and 100-day MA is likely to happen soon. The accelerated trendline (drawn from Jul. 16 low and Sep. 15 low) is likely to offer support around $9,100 levels today. It is worth noting that in 2017, dips to or below the 100-day MA were short-lived and followed by a sharp rally. For instance, prices closed (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA on Jul. 16 only to recover sharply on the following day. BTC then proceeded to set new record highs by mid-August. However, things look different this time. To start with, BTC witnessed a sharp recovery from sub-100-day MA levels on Jan. 17, but the follow-through has been weak. BTC faced rejection at $13,000 (weekend high) and closed (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA yesterday. Clearly, the bears appear to be in control. Also, as seen in the recent past (Jan, 22, Jan. 17, Jan. 16 and Dec. 22), dips below $10,391 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to 2017 high) have been transient. Again, the level could be breached convincingly this time, courtesy of the bearish chart set up as listed above. View BTC looks set to test the rising trendline support of $9,100 over the next 48 hours. A violation there would expose $8,148.79 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to 2017 high). A corrective rally is likely to be capped around the $12,000 mark, as suggested by the downward sloping 5-day MA and 10-day MA. Only a close (as per UTC) above $13,000 would abort the bearish outlook.

coindesk	belarus-government-cuts-taxes-crypto-businesses	Belarus Government Cuts Taxes For Crypto Businesses - CoinDesk	2017-12-22T23:00	The government of Belarus has passed new statutes aimed in part at encouraging the development of companies around cryptocurrency and blockchain. According to the state-owned media agency BelTA, on Dec. 22 Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko signed a digital economy development decree that legally enshrines the use of emerging technologies like blockchain, while also offering significant tax incentives in a bid to attract business activity. The decree, as summarized by a local IT firm that advocated for the legislation, boosts development of the country's High-Tech Park, a special economic zone the government wants to serve as a hub for tech and financial startups. One component of the law provides a legal basis for companies working on smart contract development, token issuance, cryptocurrency trading and mining – all of which would be exempt from income taxes for the next five years. The law states: "Turnovers, profits (income, proceeds) from various operations with tokens are not recognized as taxable items until January 2023." As reported in July, the country's central bank had already been considering avenues for domestic banks to incorporate blockchain as part of a transaction guarantee system. In another report published today, central bank chief Pavel Kallaur noted the push for the High-Tech Park to serve as a place for cryptocurrency businesses to set up shop. "As for cryptocurrencies, the Digital Economy Development Ordinance allows resident companies of the Hi-Tech Park to use cryptocurrencies for international deals. We are okay with that," he told BelTA.

coindesk	better-off-abroad-blockchain-health-firms-are-gaining-ground-outside-the-us	Better Off Abroad? Blockchain Health Firms Gain Ground Outside the US - CoinDesk	2017-10-08T11:10	Frustrated by the red tape of the U.S. healthcare system, blockchain startups founded to improve the sharing of patient data are looking abroad to prove their use cases. The moves by Gem, which has partnered with a Scandinavian company, and IncentHealth.io, which is scouting opportunities in Canada, underscore the challenges blockchain technology faces in any heavily regulated market with powerful incumbents and resistance to change. In U.S. healthcare specifically, rigid privacy laws, an abundance of intermediaries and actors, and the dominance of a few electronic health record (EHR) vendors have hindered startups' efforts to create comprehensive medical histories for people. "It's the problem that everybody brings up at every conference, but it never really gets solved in the U.S.," said Micah Winkelspecht, founder and CEO of Gem. One possible response is to start with a subset of healthcare not yet mired in such complexity. "Innovators in the healthcare space are definitely looking for use cases that do not involve Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulation," said Daniel Schott, the co-founder of North Dakota-based IncentHealth.io, which created a smoking cessation program using the ethereum blockchain. Yet, even though Schott doesn't think his project falls under HIPAA's scope, he's still looking outside the restrictions of U.S. industry first. "Because healthcare blockchain use cases face U.S. regulatory hurdles and the slow pace of technology adoption within healthcare, I will be looking to Canada as a space to further develop the IncentHealth prototype and find partner organizations," Schott told CoinDesk. But IncentHealth isn't quite as far along in development as enterprise healthcare blockchain startup Gem is, nor does it have the struggles that come from dealing with the traditional EHR system, which in the U.S. is dominated by two players, Epic and Cerner. So Gem had a similar idea to IncentHealth: take the product overseas. As announced at the Distributed: Health 2017 conference in Nashville several weeks ago, Gem has partnered with Nordic-based Tieto, one of Europe's largest IT software and service providers, to build a blockchain ecosystem that aspires to give consumers control over their individual data. Winkelspecht told CoinDesk: "Europe has taken a very progressive stance on essentially protecting the rights of individuals as to how their data is used and managed and shared. Tieto is a shining example of that mentality." Particularly in Scandinavia, Gem found less-convoluted healthcare systems, a more consumer-centric ethos toward health data and a partner on the ground willing to deploy a blockchain solution in its home market. Taking back control The move makes Tieto – which controls 60 percent of the EHR market in Finland and has a significant footprint in Sweden and Norway – the first major legacy health record vendor to fully embrace a blockchain project. Blockchain goes hand-in-hand with the company’s long-term vision for building a decentralized health model that emphasizes patients rather than providers, said Maria Kumle, business development manager at Tieto. She continued: “The notion that you as an individual actually control your digital self and anything that has to do with it is fundamental to how we see development in this industry." Expected to launch next year, the application will be built on Gem's enterprise blockchain platform and will aim to give consumers control over their medical records and genomic data. Such control, according to adherents of the idea in the blockchain space and in traditional industry, has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs and waste, create personalized medicine plans and put greater focus on preventive care. Further, a blockchain-based system could in theory let patients leverage their data for other purposes. For instance, they could consent to provide their data for research or for customized precision medical treatments. Data minefields The partnership will also serve as a test case for how blockchain solutions can help firms comply with stringent new consumer data protection rules in the EU (scheduled to come into effect in May 2018). The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) harmonizes a wide swath of patchwork consumer data protection rules into a single framework and canonizes them at the EU level. The rules apply to any company with EU customers, and failure to comply could result in a fine of as much as 4 percent of gross global revenue. The Tieto project is attempting to tackle the portion of GDPR requiring user consent for data sharing, Winkelspect said. Because consent will need to be provided before a company can use an individual’s data for a specific purpose, and that consent must be demonstrable afterward, the immutability and auditability of a blockchain make it a potentially powerful compliance tool in this scenario. Winkelspecht said: "Part of this is just proving the compliance of gathering consent, and blockchains can serve a function there as an audit history log of those event." Resistant to change Through all this, Winkelspecht hopes to come away with enough successes from the project to prompt legacy EHR vendors and stakeholders in the U.S. and elsewhere to take a deeper look at blockchain-based health data storage and ownership systems. "One of the biggest complaints about EHR systems and the large vendors is that, while they talk about interoperability a lot, it takes them literally decades to open up their systems and, even then, they really only open them up when they have to," he said. As with any project seeking to build a blockchain ecosystem, the key challenge will not just be getting the infrastructure right, but creating a user experience that will entice consumers to participate. But if it's successful, the project could be a stepping stone toward rethinking ground-level assumptions on how consumers view healthcare data, Winkelspecht said, adding: "This is a big paradigm shift of who really owns and controls data. The entire infrastructure that we've built [in the past] was always built around a controller-centric model, so this is a pretty big undertaking that is going to change a lot of systems."

coindesk	big-four-chinese-bank-launch-blockchain-bancassurance-product	'Big Four' Chinese Bank to Launch Blockchain Bancassurance Product - CoinDesk	2017-09-26T09:00	One of China's "Big Four" banks is close to launching a blockchain application aimed at the insurance and banking sectors. Announced last week, China Construction Bank (CCB) now intends to begin using a custom blockchain platform for bancassurance as soon as Q3, moving a process by which the bank today sells third-party insurance products to a distributed ledger. To be used by CCB's Asia operations, the effort has been designed to improve customer experience, reduce processing times and boost transparency. IBM, which has partnered on the technical side of the project, said its Hong Kong team has been working with CCB and its insurers on a solution to meet these needs. As such, the platform is now reportedly under testing by participants. Built with IBM Blockchain, the product comes amid a wider push by the U.S. tech giant to take the products and services it's been incubating with the technology live. For example, while IBM launched its first commercial blockchain platforms in March, it is still striving to create live networks wherein the technology can be utilized by real businesses. As recently as May, IBM's VP of blockchain technologies spoke on the issue, telling CoinDesk its strategy was then shifting to prioritize more serious customers. Still, there's evidence to suggest CCB may meet this standard. Given the 2017 launch timeline, the project could be among the first DLT implementations to see wider use.

coindesk	big-money-murky-governance-kicking-tires-telegrams-token-sale	Big Money, Murky Governance: Kicking the Tires of Telegram's Token Sale - CoinDesk	2018-01-16T09:15	Pitched as a game-changer for the cryptocurrency industry, Telegram's initial coin offering could be a lifesaver for the company. Launched in 2013 by Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, the company has never executed on the vague proposals it has floated to monetize its messaging platform. And with hefty annual operating expenses ($70 million in 2017 alone, according to the token sale primer obtained by CoinDesk), Telegram has likely burned much of the Durovs' personal fortune, which is the project's sole known funding source, people familiar with the situation said. But if successful, the forthcoming sale of cryptographic tokens known as "grams" would leave Telegram flush again, with $1.2 billion. And if the tokens hold their value over time, the company would have a recurring source of funds from the 52 percent of the 500 billion total grams created that its new foundation is keeping. Those are big ifs, of course. Heralded as the most ambitious token sale the industry has ever seen, the ICO would finance development of the Telegram Open Network for inexpensive real-time payments and eventually, a platform for decentralized identity, storage and more But while the offering has piqued widespread interest among hedge fund managers excited about the idea of Telegram bringing crypto to the masses (the company reports its messenger app has 200 million users), others are skeptical about the prospects. "There's a serious challenge to building the infrastructure," said Evgeny Vigovsky, the chief operating officer at crypto depository Saifu, which is launching an ICO soon, and an alum of Russian security giant Kaspersky Labs. "In my opinion, they are trying to take a swing at something with which they have a lack of competence." For one thing, as far as CoinDesk was able to ascertain, there isn't even an alpha version of the product yet. And further, the company's approach to encryption has long been questioned by professional cryptographers worried about the security vulnerabilities inherent in its tech, Vigovsky said. While the Telegram team has denied all such vulnerability claims in the past, Vigovsky continued: "This raises concerns about the security of the new project." Telegram has not responded to multiple requests for comment from CoinDesk. Yet perhaps more important is that the documents obtained by CoinDesk regarding the Telegram ICO do not explicitly outline why the company is seeking such a large haul. The reserve It's not unusual for token issuers to hold some of the tokens they create in reserve for use by the company later on. The hope is that the network proves enticing enough that, once the tokens start trading on the open market, they go up in value, giving the company another pool of capital (some of which it can sell later) that can keep its operations going. And sometimes, management of those reserve funds is put in the hands of foundations, and this is indeed the case with the Telegram ICO. According to the white paper, management of the reserve tokens will be handed over to the non-profit TON Foundation, and the foundation will hold off on any further sale of grams while the platform goes through its early development. Telegram's staff will keep 4 percent of the token supply, as an incentive to continue iterating on the platform, thereby theoretically increasing the value of their own pool of tokens. The TON Foundation also sets out a predictable formula for the sale of its tokens, with the very first token selling for 10 cents, and each subsequent token sold from the reserves sold for no less than one-billionth more than the last gram sold for. According to a deal summary sheet attained by CoinDesk, participants in the private sale will have access to a fixed price of $0.308 per gram, for the first $600 million in grams sold. The price for those in the public sale will increase as the sales go on, following the formula described above. If the team succeeds in raising another $600 million in the public sale, the average price paid for buyers in that sale will be $0.969 per gram. The Foundation "reserves the right not to sell any of the remaining grams at all, or to sell them at a higher price, but never at a lower price (taking into account the uncertainty of quickly changing exchange rates)," the white paper explains. Co-founder of Turing Group and token economics expert Siddhartha Kalla ran the numbers of the pricing scheme defined by the white paper. Following the white paper's formula, as the token price increases, Telegram and the TON Foundation would bring in something like $14.7 billion, Kalla said. He added: "The last gram would be sold at $14.84, which would value the five billion gram supply at $74.21 billion." That's years away and it assumes the project goes well and the TON platform attains widespread use. As MIT professor Christian Catalini told CoinDesk, "Reserves are worth nothing until the coin is allowed to float in the market." Durov control While the economics behind the gram token prioritize stabilizing the money supply, Catalini noted that it's unclear, right now, whether it will have the intended outcome. Plus, Catalini is worried about governance on the platform. According to the white paper, "The TON Foundation will have a majority of votes during the first deployment phase of the TON Blockchain, which may be useful if a lot of parameters end up needing to be adjusted, or if the need arises for hard or soft forks." Neither of the documents that CoinDesk has seen go into detail about governance, but this implies that grams equal votes over the development of the protocol. For such a large project, it's especially strange that even something as simple as voting isn't clear. Other ICO projects go into considerable detail about how governance will move forward, settling disputes and voting schemes. The TON project is opaque on all these points. For an industry that emphasizes trustless systems so much, the Durovs are asking investors to place a lot of trust in them and the Telegram team. "Overall, I would be more worried about the governance over the arbitrary parameters that can be changed ex-post by the foundation and team," Catalini told CoinDesk. "Investors should evaluate the capacity of any team to execute on their plan and vision, as well as the protections they have if things go wrong." And with that, Catalini said, more details need to be revealed about how the proceeds will be used beyond the everyday expenses. He concluded: "They need to provide a lot more detail on the monetary policy, how the parameters will be decided, what governance they see for the foundation, etc." Telegram icon on phone image via Shutterstock margin-top: 30px; padding-top: 10px; color: #aeaeae; font-style: italic;"> The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

coindesk	bitcoin-blockchain-bet-will-thrive-2018	Bitcoin or Blockchain? Bet That Both Will Thrive in 2018 - CoinDesk	2017-12-29T06:00	Caitlin Long is the chairman and president of Symbiont, an enterprise blockchain platform. The following article, an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review, outlines Long's personal views and is not intended to provide investment advice. Bitcoin and blockchain are often pitted against each other, but I come from both worlds and believe that both are game-changers in their own right. I first learned about bitcoin in 2012 through liberty-oriented channels, which I’d discovered during a search for answers about the financial crisis in 2008. But I also took a deep dive into enterprise blockchain in 2014 while at Morgan Stanley, as a side interest to my day job of running its pension solutions business. In August 2016, I joined Symbiont full-time. When I look ahead, I see 2018 as a year of maturity for both the bitcoin and enterprise blockchain parts of the space. Bitcoin will yet again prove its anti-fragility, more corporates will embrace it for payments, and the community will successfully resist its financialization. Enterprise blockchain will gain wider acceptance in production applications. Bitcoin goes corporate Bitcoin will increasingly be used for B2B foreign-exchange payments by multinational companies in 2018, as bid-offer spreads continue to tighten, daily liquidity consistently exceeds $5 billion and corporate new entrants gain comfort with liquidity providers (which enable corporates to use bitcoin for “cross-currency” transactions without touching the bitcoin itself--in other words, as an intermediary currency for foreign exchange in illiquid currencies). Corporate bitcoin use will remain predominantly for payments in markets where banking systems are not well-developed. A tell-tale sign that corporate demand is sustainable would be this: when foreign exchange (FX) trading desks start making markets in bitcoin non-deliverable forwards (NDFs). When that starts – possibly within the next 2 years – Jamie Dimon will admit his mistake and encourage corporate clients to route payments through JPMorgan’s foreign exchange desk, which will become one of the most active market-makers for cross-currency FX involving bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies will continue to attract users as more folks learn about distortions in mainstream financial markets that just don’t make sense, such as this: household net worth in the U.S. was $96.9 trillion, up $7.2 trillion in the year ending September 30, 2017 (according to the Fed’s latest Z.1 report). This means the U.S. economy supposedly generated wealth at a rate equal to roughly 40% of its annual income (GDP), despite Americans consuming virtually all of their income and saving very little. Wow, that’s a miracle! Remember this: all prices are fractions. Prices can go up either because numerators go up or because denominators go down (such as when central banks dilute fiat currencies). So...are financial markets climbing because we're truly getting richer, or because of central bank-induced asset price inflation? Are quantity-constrained cryptocurrencies a safe-haven alternative? Time will tell, but I predict cryptocurrencies will broadly benefit as more folks come to understand what’s driving distortions in financial markets. One of the "big 3" cross-currency central banks will announce in 2018 that it is preparing to issue its currency on a blockchain. The “big 3” are the “super-regional” central banks through which most “cross-currency” foreign exchange transactions settle, including the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. The Fed is behind the curve, but in 2018 either the BoE or the BoJ will step forward to allow tokenization of its currency to be executed by institutions in regulatory sandboxes. Corporate treasurers around the world will cheer at the prospect of same-day FX settlement through one (or two) of these “big-3” currencies because it will free up hundreds of billions of capital currently trapped on corporate balance sheets, due to payment system latency. Yet for all bitcoin’s strengths, I believe advances in the enterprise blockchain will outpace those of bitcoin in 2018. Let’s face it – enterprises are slower to move than the cryptoasset sector, which moves-fast-and-sometimes-breaks-things. I believe 2018 will be the year in which a watershed event happens: an enterprise blockchain platform passes a CISO (chief information security officer) audit and is deployed inside the firewall of major financial institutions. Enterprise goes live Consensus 2018 will be "back to the suits." Let’s face it: attire at industry’s biggest conference has been a pretty good barometer of what's hot in the space. At the inaugural Consensus conference in 2015, bitcoin t-shirts dominated the audience. In 2016, business suits dominated as bankers discovered the space. In 2017, the dominant attire swung back to t-shirts, but this time for ethereum and ICOs. In 2018, I predict it will be "back to the suits" as enterprise blockchain accomplishments will again dominate the sector’s headlines, late-followers will scramble to catch up, and corporate treasurers will attend en masse. The first institutional bond offering will be issued on a blockchain in the U.S. in 2018. Bond markets, not stock markets, will see the first U.S. institutional-level securities issued on a blockchain. Because the regulatory requirement to issue securities in “depository-eligible” (indirect) form does not apply to bond markets, the first institutional securities issued on a blockchain will be bonds – something I’ve predicted for years. In 2018, I believe it will finally happen. Yet, the coming clash between the federal securities laws that govern equities (which contemplate indirect ownership via the DTCC’s Cede & Co.) and state corporate laws (which contemplate that shares are owned directly by shareholders) will not happen yet in 2018. No new blockchain consortiums will be formed in 2018. If 2017 were the year of forming new consortiums, 2018 will be the year of bilateral projects. Blockchains are networks and therefore suffer from the proverbial chicken and egg problem – consortium first and then project, or project first and then consortium? Consortiums now exist across a wide variety of industries, but – at least for now – more action is happening outside of consortiums than inside them. Enterprise blockchain adoption will advance beyond incremental-type uses in production, such as sharing of data, to include transformational uses, such as custody of institutional financial assets that only ever exist on a blockchain. This will shine light on quality differences between platforms -- and separate those that are decentralized and offer transformational benefits from those that don’t quite. A big gap will open in 2018 between the "haves" and "have-nots" in enterprise blockchain. 2018 will be a consolidation year as the sector matures. The sector came of age in 2017, as adoption broadened in both bitcoin and blockchain. In 2018, both will strengthen and deepen further. And property owners the world round will rejoice.

coindesk	bitcoin-bull-reversal-sighted-momentum-proves-weak	Bitcoin Bull Reversal Sighted, But Momentum Proves Weak - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T12:50	Bitcoin bulls seem to have gained an upper hand, but the cryptocurrency is still struggling to find follow-through buying today. On Wednesday, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price index (BPI) closed (as per UTC) 5.15 percent higher at $11,399. The positive close above $11,000 adds credence to the solid defense of the $10,000 mark seen earlier this week. That said, the follow-through is not necessarily encouraging. The BPI clocked a high of $11,711 at 03:59 UTC today before falling back below $11,200. As of writing, the BPI stands at $11,350. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 3 percent in the last 24 hours, says data source OnChainFX. Bitcoin chart - Bull reversal confirmed The bullish doji reversal at the key support of $10,391.02 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to 2017 high) validates the argument that BTC has built a base around $10,000 and points to a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. The 5-day MA and 10-day MA carry a bearish bias and could limit the upside in BTC. A bullish doji reversal occurs when a doji candle (as seen on Tuesday) is followed by a positive price action (yesterday's 5 percent gain). So, the short-term outlook is bullish. Still, there is merit in being cautious. Comments on social media indicate the investor community is not convinced by previous day's bullish price action and wants to see a sustained move above $11,500 before calling a bottom. The argument has substance says the chart below. 4-hour chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows- Bitcoin witnessed a solid recovery on Jan. 17 from the low of $9,005 on the back of strong volumes. However, volumes have dropped in the subsequent days. This could be the reason behind bitcoin's failure to rise above the falling trendline hurdle on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21. BTC has had another go at the trendline resistance today, but once again volumes remain low. Higher lows as represented by the rising trendline. View Bullish doji reversal was confirmed yesterday, but so far bitcoin has been unable to generate the follow through necessary to declare that the bottoming process is complete. Only a high volume break above the trendline resistance on the 4-hour chart would add credence to the bullish doji reversal and open doors for a sustained move higher to $13,000 and $14,250. On the other hand, rejection at the falling trendline followed by a high volume drop below $10,300 (rising trendline support on the 4 - hour chart) could yield re-test of last week's low of $9,005. That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below $10,391.02 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to 2017 high) would revive the bearish outlook.

coindesk	bitcoin-defends-11000-mark-and-eyes-move-higher	Bitcoin Defends $11,000 Mark and Eyes Move Higher - CoinDesk	2018-01-22T12:10	Bitcoin is stuck in a narrow range currently, but a breakout may lie ahead, the price charts indicate. Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rallied to a high of $13,000 on Saturday, but the spike was short-lived as prices fell back to $11,096 at 20:59 UTC yesterday. As of writing, BPI stands at $11,700 – up 5.4 percent from yesterday's low. Still, the cryptocurrency is down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis, as per data source OnChainFX. Interestingly, some in the investor community feel the U.S. government shutdown may have influenced the rise in BTC prices over the weekend. However, if history is any guide, BTC is unlikely to rally significantly on the political standoff in Washington. For instance, during the last standoff (Oct. 1–17, 2013), BTC appreciated by 10 percent (not a huge move by BTC's standards), as data from CoinMarketCap shows. Further, prices were largely range-bound in the run-up to the deadlock and began rising sharply after it ended. That possibility aside, the price chart analysis indicates scope for a rally to $15,000 and above – if the narrow range ($11,000 to $13,000) ends with an upside break. 4-hour chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows: BTC rallied to $12,500 as expected and extended gains to $13,000 over the weekend, yet failed to cut through the descending trendline resistance (marked by a circle). The failure at the trendline hurdle and a drop to sub-$12,000 levels only add credence to the downward sloping (bearish bias) 50-MA, 100-MA and 200-MA. Bitcoin chart Prices closed (as per UTC) above $12,500 on Saturday, signaling a short-term bottom is in place at $9,005 and potential for a rally to $15,000 levels. However, the follow-through was weak. BTC fell back to $11,500 levels yesterday and is currently trading at $11,700 levels. The reversal below $12,500 has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook. Meanwhile, BTC's strong defense of 11,004.61 (100-day MA + 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) is keeping bears the bay. View The bias is neutral as long as price remains stuck in the range of $11,000–$13,000. That said, risks are skewed to the upside, given the repeated rebound from near $11,000 levels. Only a close below $11,004 following a rejection at $12,500 would open the doors for a deeper pullback to $8,000 levels. On the other hand, a violation at $13,000 could yield rally to $15,733 levels (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $19,891.99 to $9,005).

coindesk	bitcoin-dev-jimmy-song-is-now-a-blockchain-capital-partner	Bitcoin Dev Jimmy Song Is Now at Blockchain Capital - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T13:00	Blockchain Capital announced today that bitcoin developer Jimmy Song has joined the company as a venture partner. With his expertise around cryptocurrency technology, Song's addition is aimed to provide technical assistance to the firm's investment research efforts, as well as build bridges between Blockchain Capital and crypto developers, according to a press release. He will also head upcoming programs to advance blockchain innovations. The blockchain industry has been evolving differently from the internet, stated c o-founder and managing partner of Blockchain Capital, Bart Stephens. This difference, he said, has made possible for developers and engineers to stand at the forefront of innovation. With Song's addition to the firm, Stephens continued: "Jimmy has demonstrated a deep commitment to the crypto development community. These 'unsung heroes' push the innovation envelope and bring to market much of the technology and services that comprise the blockchain and crypto industry today." Aside from his bitcoin development work, Song has served as a principal architect at blockchain firm Paxos, as well as vice president of engineering at open-source wallet management platform Armory Technologies. At present, Song also runs a training company called Programming Blockchain, that provides blockchain programming and development training. He is also the author of " Bitcoin Tech Talk," a cryptocurrency-focused blog. With his new role, Song stated that his passion for cryptocurrency industry grew two years after bitcoin was founded in 2009. " At that time, the community was relatively small and comprised of a core group of developers willing to volunteer their time and intellectual capital for the good of the industry. Now, the ecosystem has soared past numerous milestones," he said.

coindesk	bitcoin-emerging-systemic-risk	Bitcoin Is an Emerging Systemic Risk - CoinDesk	2017-12-01T02:00	Preston Byrne is an independent consultant and founder of Tomram LLC and the former chief operating officer of Monax Industries, an enterprise blockchain software vendor. Recent news stories make it pretty clear that the new people in bitcoin have no idea what they’ve gotten themselves into. Bitcoin is the Gom Jabbar of high finance. Cypherpunks who have populated the space to date hold the line because they do not care about money, and therefore do not fear. These new people are different. The only reason they are here is the money. They reek of fear. When we consider that money from fresh, naive amateurs is flowing into the sector at a rate of millions of people per month, we should also understand that these amateurs are more susceptible to the animal spirits than their stoic, abrasive, less-socially-adept, battle-hardened forebears. They will be prone to cut and run. As such, a shock to the system, such as an exchange being taken down in a necessary and overdue enforcement action, could lead to a loss in confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole and a stampede for the exits the likes of which bitcoin has not seen to date. In a recent post on my own blog, I pointed out that bitcoin, by setting itself up as a sort of decentralized bank, was also creating an unreasonable expectation to its new "depositors" that they will always be able to redeem their assets at par, given a wild mismatch between its $200 billion "market cap" and new investor money – which is clearly well shy of that number. This expectation is dangerous as it means, in the event of a liquidity crunch, people will behave not as people necessarily behave when there’s a sharp sell-off in a stock, but more along the lines of when their bank’s solvency is being called into question. Remember bank runs? As bitcoin qua decentralized bank is running a fractional reserve with a chronic shortage of dollars, a shock therefore has the potential to not just drive the price of bitcoin down a little bit, but also lead to a major liquidity crunch and abject panic. Credit comes to crypto In my post, I wrote: "In the current environment, there are a number of ways such a shock could arise. To begin with, I seriously question the intermediaries’ and traders’ ability to top up their USD holdings quickly enough to catch up with their depositors’ and counterparties’ paper gains in bitcoin. There is also the possibility that, in the event of a correction or an enforcement action, a risk-averse bank to a major service provider withdraws either credit or banking services to that provider, compromising that service provider’s ability to convert BTC into dollars, provide margin lending, or even to hold fiat deposits at all." I had a hunch people were lending into the sector. I just didn't know the degree of alacrity with which this lending was taking place. Fortunately, I was reading CoinDesk this afternoon and the reporting from the Consensus:Invest conference delivered : "Dan Matuszewski, the head of trading at Circle Internet Financial, said during a morning panel that there is a ‘real strong need’ for the ability to borrow in this market. It would not only facilitate short positions but also provide working capital for trading desks to make markets, he said. During his talk, [Max] Boonen of B2C2 acknowledged the irony of the situation given that bitcoin was born as a reaction to the 2008 credit crisis. ‘Bitcoin enthusiasts really, really do not like credit,’ he said. But, he added, ‘for better or for worse, credit is an important part of a functioning and liquid financial market…’ …Even before the institutional money started flowing in, he noted, 'by necessity, credit did creep back into bitcoin and crypto markets in general,' with the major exchanges offering leverage to the early retail investors." So someone's lending directly into the market, we just don't know who, nor how much, nor where the liquidity for these lines of credit is ultimately coming from. Leverage sneaks into the ecosystem in other ways, too; for example, Coinbase accepts credit cards, which is basically margin trading for grandmas, without collateral and with 20%+ rates of annual interest. Given that rather a lot of people seem to be interested in buying bitcoin in this way, and that platform is racking up a few hundred thousand new users a week, there’s undoubtedly systemic risk building up there. Then there’s Bitfinex and Tether, which I do not intend to discuss save to share this passage from The New York Times : "One persistent online critic, going by the screen name Bitfinex’ed, has written several very detailed essays on Medium arguing that Bitfinex appears to be creating Tether coins out of thin air and then using them to buy Bitcoin and push the price up." Long story short, these neophyte masters of the universe, too young (or too busy working as a dev in California) to know what a financial crisis feels like, and too dilettantish to find out, are successfully (a) getting buyers to leverage to buy coins, in some cases probably up to the hilt, or (b) convincing institutions to lend into this titanic, one-way, unhedged, $300 billion insanity trade, and trying to convince more of them to do so in greater amounts. This could become serious There are two not necessarily mutually exclusive ways people are responding to the Great Bubble of 2017: anticipatory schadenfreude on the one hand, abject horror on the other. So far the response from mainstream finance has been the former, with The Wall Street Journal’s treatment of the subject being more or less a long-form joke. But while there is something ineffably twee about a retiree trying to show how they’re hip and "down with the kids" thanks to their position in "big coin," the fact that they are doing so raises very serious questions about bubble-driven risk (and attendant negative externalities to society) which merits closer attention. As of right now, the notional value of the cryptocurrency sector is roughly a third the size of Long-Term Capital Management at its peak. Cryptocurrency is, admittedly, much smaller than the subprime bubble that popped a decade ago, which was roughly two orders of magnitude larger than bitcoin today. But bitcoin has shown, on several occasions, a persistent ability to defy detractors like me to grow an order of magnitude in less than 12 months; if it does so again, it will be three times larger than LTCM. LTCM on its own very nearly ruined the world in 1998. If we aren’t careful, this is the kind of market where a financial institution can get in serious trouble extremely quickly (imagine the damage a character like Nick Leeson or Kweku Adoboli could have done trading Bitcoin contracts – which are coming soon to both the CME and, reportedly, Nasdaq). We know that cryptocurrency marketing is writing checks the technology can’t cash; most of these systems are unusable as backbones for global finance. It is a matter of time before the punter on the street becomes as disillusioned as I, an irascible blockchain software entrepreneur, have become. It’s just that none of the newcomers know what they’re doing, and most of the old-timers who have figured this out are keeping their mouths shut out of self-interest. Put another way, this is a disaster waiting to happen. Fortunately for us, 2008 is not ancient history, and the fact that Bitcoin is a classic, manic bubble is so transparently obvious that it should be impossible for thinking people to deal with it otherwise. There are no excuses for not doing right by the societies and taxpayers who had to bail out the financial services industry last time around. Just say no So, banks, shadow banks, and anyone else of systemic importance, I implore you: for the good of everyone, by which I mean for the good of the human species, keep this garbage, and anything connected to it, the hell off of your balance sheets. For once, please have the good sense to not load up on frothy bubble-driven financial assets, which you have done hitherto with such predictable regularity that the European Central Bank can model it and write a 52-page paper on the subject which is actually fun to read. That way, when regulators finally bring this party to the bitter end it so richly deserves, the rest of the ship won’t go down with it.

coindesk	bitcoin-exchange-btcc-just-got-acquired	Bitcoin Exchange BTCC Just Got Acquired - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T14:30	Bitcoin startup BTCC has been acquired by a Hong Kong-based blockchain investment fund. While details remain scarce on the deal, BTCC said in a press release that the move will help its efforts to expand internationally following its recent closure in mainland China. Bobby Lee, BTCC's co-founder, said: "Today's acquisition is an incredible milestone for BTCC.... I'm very excited about the resources this gives BTCC to move faster and aggressively grow our businesses in 2018 and beyond.” According to the statement, the company now aims to "lead every segment of the digital currency ecosystem," expanding into the international market after Chinese authorities forced the closure of all cryptocurrency exchanges at the end of September 2017. While its DAX cryptocurrency exchange is no longer in operation, BTCC will focus on its three main products: a mining pool, its Mobi bitcoin wallet and a USD/BTC exchange service. According to BTCC, which is now registered in the U.K., its exchange business traded over $25 billion in bitcoin in 2017, while its mining pool produced almost $900 million-worth of bitcoin in the same year. CoinMarketCap data indicates that trading volumes for USD/BTC on the BTCC exchange was $123 million over the last 24 hours. It is currently in eighth place in the global volume rankings. The BTCC mining pool accounts for 3.2 percent of bitcoin's hashing power at press time, according to blockchain.info.

coindesk	bitcoin-is-back-above-11500-but-bulls-not-out-of-the-woods-yet	Bitcoin Is Back Above $11,500, But Bulls Not Out of the Woods Yet - CoinDesk	2018-01-18T12:30	Despite a sharp price recovery to over $11,500 today, bitcoin's bulls are not out of the woods yet, the price charts suggest. Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) has climbed 25.9 percent from the eight-week low of $9,199.59 hit yesterday at 15:44 UTC. As of writing, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $11,590 levels. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 8 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChainFX. However, the investor community isn't convinced by the move, and comments on social media show that some believe the overnight recovery is nothing more than a " dead cat bounce." The price chart analysis indicates that only a close (as per UTC) above $12,500 (prices as per Coinbase) would add credence to rebound from sub-100-day moving average (MA) levels and confirm that a short-term bottom is in place. Bitcoin chart: Bottom in place? As seen on the chart above (prices as per Coinbase), bitcoin has consistently left higher lows at/below the 100-day MA line. On the previous two occasions, the relative strength index (RSI) showed oversold conditions. As of today, the RSI is staying within the oversold territory (above 30.00). Bitcoin's drop below the 100-day MA yesterday was short-lived. The situation looks similar to that seen in mid/late March 2017, when BTC prices flirted with 100-day MA for more than a week before moving higher. Back then, the RSI was just shy of oversold conditions Still, it appears to be too early to call a bottom. Yesterday's long-tailed candle (big difference between intraday low and UTC close) does show strong dip demand. However, only a positive close today would validate the sharp recovery from $9,005 (previous day's low). Bitcoin chart: Bulls need a close above $12,500 The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows: A long-tailed candle indicating dip demand near the ascending trendline (drawn from July low and September low) support. Lower highs and lower lows as indicated by the descending trendline and a drop below $12,500 on Tuesday. 5-day and 10-day MAs carry a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards). The RSI remains below 50.00 (in the bearish territory). Except for the first point, all other factors favor a drop to $8,690–$8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 rally). View The recovery from $9,005 has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook. The daily chart suggests that a historical pattern (higher lows along the 100-day MA) could be repeated. However, only a close (as per UTC) above $12,500 (Dec. 30 low) would confirm a bottom is in place at $9,005 (previous day's low) and open the doors for a rally to $15,800 (descending trendline hurdle) and beyond. The sell-off would resume if BTC fails to hold above the 100-day MA over the next 48 hours. In such a scenario, prices could test $8,690–$8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 rally).

coindesk	bitcoin-likely-become-niche-product-says-ings-top-economist	Bitcoin Likely to Become 'Niche' Product, Says ING's Top Economist - CoinDesk	2017-12-19T07:00	The chief economist for Dutch banking giant ING believes bitcoin will likely wind up as a niche financial product, according to a new report. In a report from Dec. 18, ING's principal economist Teunis Brosens argued that actual use of the cryptocurrency will be limited to "tech nerds, people obsessed about their privacy, [and] people afraid of (hyper) inflation of traditional currencies," among others. "In the long term, bitcoin has little to offer to a wider audience, and will likely return to being a niche product for a select group of enthusiasts," he wrote. Bronsens' opinion is perhaps at odds with other pronouncements about bitcoin in recent days, which has seen its price trade in excess of $18,000 amid the launch of derivatives contracts on regulated exchanges in the U.S. Indeed, he argued that some of bitcoin's characteristics that are often cited as strengths – the lack of a central intermediary, for example – would keep it out of arm's reach from a more mainstream audience. He also posited that the price volatility around bitcoin makes it a poor method of payment for most consumers. "For bitcoin to function as a means of payment, it needs to be stable. A world in which your money buys you a large latte today, but only a small espresso tomorrow, is hardly convenient," he wrote. While the economist's commentary mostly focused on bitcoin, he also extended his criticism to cryptocurrencies in general, arguing that one of their core features – being open source – is also ill-suited for mass-market use. "While cryptocurrencies do compete with each other for users, and can create value for their users by providing an extensive network of other users, they are not able to create unique value for their users by being a distinctive platform with special features not found elsewhere," Brosens wrote in the report. While casting a critical eye on bitcoin, Bronsens struck a largely positive note about blockchain, writing: "Blockchain is an impressive technology that may bring progress to a variety of fields, ranging from finance to health care, and from notary to voting. Long live the blockchain."

coindesk	bitcoin-mining-wastes-energy-thats-good-thing	Bitcoin Mining Wastes Energy? What If That's Good? - CoinDesk	2018-01-09T09:00	Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative. I am frustrated by the debate over whether or not bitcoin is an environmental disaster waiting to happen. No one seems to know what assumptions to use. Depending on what efficiency ratios we assume for currently operating ASIC mining rigs, they're either consuming 35 terawatt-hours per year, the equivalent of Denmark, or something far less, closer perhaps to Bolivia. The stinginess of mining pools to provide information about their operations can be partly blamed for this. We also don't know how much of mining runs on low-carbon energy, such as the mining farms that use geothermal energy in Iceland or hydropower in Washington State. Surely that matters. And then there’s the "compared to what?" question. Gas-guzzling banks If bitcoin is to be assessed as an alternative to fiat currencies, banks and traditional payment systems, then we must consider the costs of securing those systems – the physical bank branches, the armored cars, the staff employed in fraud detection, and so forth. While only a portion of those legacy costs goes to energy consumption, savings from foregoing those costs could be put toward constructive uses for humankind, such as building more renewable energy sources. But then, what metric do we use to compare bitcoin to banks? Bitcoin is still a pipsqueak compared with the total value of fiat transactions, which still means its energy consumption is proportionately very high. Motherboard recently claimed that one bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as the average house does in a week. Still, we all know that transaction growth on the network has slowed due to congestion and a fixed block size. So, as rising bitcoin prices keep enticing miners to add more hashing power, the numerator is increasing while the denominator stays steady, resulting in a massive surge in per-transaction electricity. And while that's hardly a shining endorsement for bitcoin, it's less of a critique of its energy efficiency than of its scaling challenges. Things change Which brings me to an even bigger gripe I have with the ill-defined bitcoin energy debate, which is that too many people assume that technology remains static, perhaps without thinking. That's a crazy assumption for an industry in which intense competition for block rewards and an open-source developer pool come together in a dynamic cauldron of development. Technological advances in both cryptocurrencies and energy are changing more rapidly than any of us can keep up with. We must keep that in mind. On that note, point number one: Lightning is coming. While its payment channels solution isn't specifically aimed at energy efficiency, if we think about the cost issue as a per-transaction metric, it could help making bitcoin less damaging to the environment – at least when assessed relative to its utility as a payments service. Whether Lightning succeeds in encouraging more people to use bitcoin for small transactions, rather than hoarding it to capture price gains, remains to be seen. But if you compare what it costs to run the tiny amount of computer processing power to send peer-to-peer payments over a network of Lightning channels against those of the banking and infrastructure needed to process card payments over the Visa network, this future model for bitcoin starts to look far more efficient. Point number two comes via Coin Center's Peter Van Valkenburgh, who astutely argued that the more miners are enticed to compete for bitcoin – again, a function of its rising price – the more they are encouraged to seek ever-more efficient sources of power to boost margins and secure an advantage over others. With the price of solar and wind energy in some places now at 2 cents per KwH or lower, that search will increasingly lead them in the direction of renewable sources. Where the argument gets really interesting is when we assume that a rising bitcoin price will drive demand for hashing power so high that the network, as some alarmists say, will consume more power than the U.S. by 2019. Bitcoin saves humanity? If that happens, then it should not only incentivize miners to seek low-cost renewable energy, but also drive energy firms to work hard at developing solutions for them, with spillover benefits for the rest of the world. In other words, the incentives that bitcoin demand puts in place could not only drive efficiency and green energy solutions in the crypto world but help to spur them in the wider economy too. In retrospect, Van Valkenburgh's point should have been blindingly obvious to all familiar with how Moore's Law and the incentives of economic competition have driven technology toward greater efficiency for the past 50 years. It wasn't obvious because, as I mentioned, people tend to think in terms of a stasis. They fail to see the dynamic feedback loops generated by rapidly changing technologies such as bitcoin. This, I think is the most important lesson from the many debates that roil the bitcoin community. In an industry where technological change – rapid, relentless technological change – is the only constant, any debate about the future must acknowledge it as a variable.

coindesk	bitcoin-no-threat-to-financial-stability-say-european-economists	Bitcoin No Threat to Financial Stability, Say European Economists - CoinDesk	2017-12-20T10:00	A group of European economists believe bitcoin is no threat to the financial stability, although regulatory oversight needs to be increased, new research shows. In a survey published yesterday by the U.K.-based Center for Macroeconomics, 100 prominent European university economists were asked for their thoughts regarding the recent market growth of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. According to the results from the 50 respondents – in response to the question "Do you agree that cryptocurrencies are currently a threat to the stability of the financial system, or can be expected to become a threat in the next couple of years?" – nearly 50 percent of the respondents said they "disagree," while another 25 percent "strongly disagree." Some economist argued that, even with a near-$300 billion market capitalization, bitcoin is still trivial compared to the overall financial market. For example, Michael McMahon, professor in economics from the University of Oxford, was quoted as saying: "Cryptocurrencies are still too small and lacking in widespread ownership, especially among large investment groups, to be a serious risk to the overall financial system." Similarly, Ethan Ilzetzki, assistant professor from the Economics Department Centre for Macroeconomics at London School of Economics, called bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies "a toy for a very narrow segment of investors." Further, they are "detached" from the financial system and the "real economy," he said. While not recognizing bitcoin as a threat, a majority of the respondents still expressed concerns around the role of bitcoin and its challenge to traditional central bank-issued currencies. In fact, 61 percent of the interviewees either "agree" or "strongly agree" that regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies needs to be increased. For instance, Sylvester Eijffinger, professor of financial economics at Tilburg University, argued that cryptocurrencies are "undermining the monopoly of money creation by the central banks and [leading to] the ineffectiveness of conventional and unconventional monetary policy." However, the European Central Bank takes a somewhat different view on bitcoin. Addressing the European Parliament late in November, the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi, stated that digital currencies are "not yet something that could constitute a risk for central banks."

coindesk	bitcoin-price-looking-heavy-news-turns-negative	Bitcoin Price Looking Heavy As News Turns Negative - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T11:45	Bitcoin's possible upside appears capped by a recent run of negative news. Following a hack against the exchange Coincheck last week, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) turned lower from $11,942 (Sunday high), ultimately hitting a low of $11,110 at 09:59 UTC Monday. Still, what may be more notable is not the recent price (which continues its sideways 2018 trajectory), but the changing narrative for potential buyers. Though the Coincheck news did not impact bitcoin directly (no bitcoin was stolen), it does appear to have marked a change in a mainstream news narrative that has breathlessly provided tailwinds for the market since late last year. For example, the 6.9 percent drop from the high of $11,492 may be due to concerns regarding the solvency of a startup called Tether, which provides a proxy cryptocurrency used by exchanges in lieu of the U.S. dollar. While bloggers have long accused Tether of creating the asset out of thin air, news reports are now speculating doomsday scenarios following a CoinDesk report that suggests the startup has broken ties with an auditor acquired to calm market fears. In the press, experts have been quoted as saying that bitcoin (BTC) price could crash 80 percent if it turns out Tether is fraudulent. And though that scenario doesn't appear likely, coupled with chart analysis, it does perhaps increase the odds of a break below $10,000. As of writing, BTC is trading at $11,064 on Coinbase's GDAX exchange. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 1 percent in the last 24 hours, says data source OnChinaFX. Bitcoin 4-hour chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows- Failed bullish breakout - BTC's failure to cut through resistance at $11,690, despite the upside break of the symmetrical triangle on Friday could end up strengthening the bears. Currently, prices are threatening to drop below the rising trendline support. 50-MA, 100-MA and 200-MA are sloping downwards in favor the bears. View A break below the rising trendline would open doors for $10,000 and possibly extend the drop to $9,000. As discussed in the previous update, dips below the $10,000 mark are to be viewed with caution. On the higher side, only a move above $11,690 could yield a sustained rally to $13,000.

coindesk	bitcoin-price-seeks-direction-as-trading-range-narrows	Bitcoin Price Seeks Direction as Trading Range Narrows - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T13:40	Bitcoin's price range continues to narrow with each passing day, but a big move on either side could happen soon, the technical charts suggest. Having witnessed a bull reversal on Wednesday, prices on CoinDesk's bitcoin price index (BPI) rose to $11,711 at 03:59 yesterday. It appeared as though bitcoin (BTC) would break above $12,000 and confirm completion of the bottoming process. However, prices fell back to $10,889 at 17:59 UTC. Bitcoin bulls made another attempt to regain lost glory, but faced rejection at $11,608 in Asian hours today. The failure to capitalize on Wednesday's bull reversal has yielded a drop to a three-day low of $10,321 today. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $10,600. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 4.11 percent in the last 24 hours, says data source OnChainFX. Further, the drop from the previous day's high of $11,711 to below $10,500 has neutralized the immediate outlook. A break either up or down would likely set the tone for the next major move. 4-hour chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows bitcoin has created a symmetrical triangle. It comprises of two converging trendlines, representing a series of sequentially lower peaks and higher troughs. It is a trend continuation pattern, i.e. it usually ends with a big move in the direction of the original trend. In BTC's case, the symmetrical triangle is formed in a downtrend (sell-off from a record high of $20,000). So, the narrowing price range (symmetrical triangle) could end with a big move to the downside. Such a move would open doors for a slide to $5,232 (target as per the measured height method - the difference between triangle high and low subtracted from the breakdown price/triangle support of $10,480). However, the downside target sounds far-fetched. Nevertheless, BTC could revisit $9,000 following confirmation (4-hour close below triangle support) of a downside break of the symmetrical triangle pattern. The relative strength index (RSI) is sloping downwards, suggesting scope for a drop in prices. The key MAs - 50, 100, 200 - are sloping downwards in favor of the bears. So, the downside break looks likely as per the 4-hour chart. That said, the dips below the $10,000 mark are to be viewed with caution says the daily chart. Daily chart So far, the bears have consistently failed to keep BTC prices under $10,000. Also, BTC has been able to avoid a daily close (as per UTC) below $10,391 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to high). Further, the rising trendline (drawn from July low and September low) support is lined up at $9,370. So, there is always a risk of BTC running into bids anywhere between $9,000 to $10,000. View A bearish symmetrical triangle breakdown could yield a sell-off to $9,000, but dips below $10,000 could be transient. Only a daily close (as per UTC) below the ascending trendline support of $9,370 would open doors for a sustained move lower to $8,148 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to high). Bullish Scenario: An upside break of the symmetrical triangle would add credence to persistent demand around $10,000 and could see BTC test resistance at $13,000 and $14,622 (50-day moving average) over the weekend.

coindesk	bitcoin-takes-private-blockchains-need-patience	Bitcoin Takes All? Enterprise Blockchains Need Time, Too - CoinDesk	2017-12-16T14:45	Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and the former editor-in-chief of American Banker. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers. Last week I described how bitcoin, as a deflationary currency, encourages delayed gratification. Now there's evidence that bitcoin's straight-laced twin, enterprise blockchain technology, requires such an attitude as well. Overshadowed by the bitcoin price action, the enterprise use case – and one of its most prominent evangelists – scored a major advance last week. But it was a hard-won victory. After two years of exploration, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) decided to replace its decades-old post-trade settlement system with a distributed ledger from Digital Asset, the startup led by former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters. That's right, replace. This is not another pilot or a proof of concept or a sandbox, it's real production. Masters called the agreement "precedent-setting," and it'll be interesting to see what else her company does with its $115 million war chest after this prolonged and successful courtship. But the achievement is all the more impressive considering that the ASX was publicly skeptical about the technology throughout the testing process. Plan B So skeptical that the exchange had a contingency plan in place, in case it decided Digital Asset’s technology wasn’t suitable. It probably didn’t help that just months after the partnership with DA was announced, the ASX CEO who had championed blockchain resigned (even though the exchange quickly reaffirmed its commitment to exploring the tech’s possibilities.) And it almost certainly didn’t help when, about a year into the process, stakeholders started to express disillusionment about blockchain in the Australian financial press. Despite all these hurdles, Masters’ team won over the ASX. "We believe that using DLT... will enable our customers to develop new services and reduce their costs, and it will put Australia at the forefront of innovation in financial markets," Dominic Stevens, managing director and CEO of the ASX, said in announcing the final decision. Believe. That’s a strong word, one you hear often in bitcoin, but seldom in enterprise blockchain. Too big to bungle And perhaps rightly so. Financial market infrastructure is, to use the parlance of regulators, "systemically important" – too big and too interconnected with the rest of the economy to bet on a buzzword. The careful, deliberate approach ASX took with DA before closing the deal last week was appropriate. If anything, it’s remarkable it took only two years to get this far. But that, in turn, means others watching and participating in the space are going to have to exercise patience as well. This is not the kind of technology where you can "move fast and break things," as Facebook famously encourages its employees to do. Bitcoin’s resurgence this year has embarrassed the know-it-alls who wrote it off two years ago, confidently declaring that the blockchain, not the currency, would take off. But DA’s big win shows it was also premature to declare commercial blockchains over, as many bitcoiners were understandably tempted to do this year.

coindesk	bitcoin-wont-cause-lehman-style-meltdown-says-mas-fintech-chief	Bitcoin Won't Cause Lehman-Style Meltdown, Says MAS Fintech Chief - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T17:15	The fintech chief at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country's de facto central bank, has said that bitcoin is unlikely to cause a global financial meltdown similar to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008. Speaking in an interview with Channel News Asia, MAS chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty said that he does not foresee a bitcoin price collapse triggering a major financial crash, adding there are indications that global regulators are "getting serious" about the cryptocurrency market. Mohanty said: "We know exactly when to intervene, based on the market size and the demand and transaction volume, and we will come in at the right time. So, I'm not overly worried about getting to some large financial system crisis." The fintech head further stated that regulators would come forward to apply regulation on consumer protection amidst hype in the digital currency market. MAS has made several statements on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings in recent months. In December 2017, citing the recent "speculative" escalation in prices across the crypto markets, the monetary authority released a statement advising the public to take "extreme caution" if investing in digital currencies. And the previous month, MAS issued guidance on the application of securities laws when it comes to initial coin offerings (ICOs). It stated at the time that tokens sold through the ICO model may be considered securities under certain circumstances, according to Singapore's Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act. Its report included case studies, including a token tied to a computing power-sharing platform (which wouldn't count as a security) and another of on a token connected to a startup investment fund (which would count as a security).

coindesk	bitcoins-lightning-network-problem-people-already-using	Lightning Has a Problem: People Are Already Using It - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T05:00	Fake money is boring. At least, that's the contention of many micropayment enthusiasts, whose impatience for the Lightning Network has led to an influx of real bitcoin being transacted over the network, even though developers caution people against doing so since it's still in the testing phase. "The testnet just doesn't have the same adrenaline rush," representatives of VPN service TorGuard told CoinDesk, after announcing it would be accepting Lightning payments. And they're not the only ones – Blockstream launched a Lightning-only merchandise store using its own Lightning implementation, c-lightning, and a Lightning main net explorer suggests more than $33,000 in bitcoin has been transacted via Lightning Networks. The excitement is not hard to explain – the off-chain technology promises near-instant transaction speeds with vastly reduced fees – and many enthusiasts believe using the network on the bitcoin mainnet, as opposed to on the testnet, will speed up the time it takes to get the Lightning Network ready for prime time. "I think it's time for [Lightning Network] to go live, even if still buggy. But this is the best way to harden it," one Twitter user wrote. Yet using the network while it's still in development has not only led to confusion as to its readiness, but it's also caused several people to lose real bitcoin funds. Because of that, Blockstream's decision has been criticized, and others have called opening Lightning channels with hundreds and thousands of dollars of bitcoin " crazy." In spite of persistent warnings, though, mainnet implementations of Lightning already have over 205 nodes and 548 channels, at press time, with no sign of stalling. Yet, what this momentum is slowing, according to developers, is the rate at which Lightning will be safe to use on the bitcoin mainnet. As Pierre-Marie Padiou, who develops Lightning at ACINQ, told CoinDesk: "Recently we have seen more and more users configuring their software for mainnet, some thinking that this will make Lightning Network deployment happen faster somehow." Distracting the devs But that's just not the case. In a recent interview, CEO of Lightning Labs, Elizabeth Stark, approximated the developer count on the Lightning Network to be as low as ten individuals – a factor which as detailed by CoinDesk could be slowing down the release of the tech. Perhaps due to this shortage, Lightning Labs has appealed to users to stop sending money over the system, stating that, "It has become an unnecessary distraction for our devs." "A lot of people want to get on mainnet and it’s hard to tell them that it’s not quite ready and that they should test on testnet," said Alex Bosworth, a Lightning developer. "I wouldn't recommend using mainnet unless you are explicitly testing and fully know what you are doing." According to Bosworth, who runs two of his own mainnet nodes, one major problem Lightning developers could run into as they move to release a mainnet implementation is needing to be backwards-compatible, so that the upcoming release would interoperate with the current prototypes being developed. If the nascent mainnet continues to mature – it has doubled in node count in the past 72 hours – it could "reduce the speed of development," as devs would "have to worry about keeping backwards compatibility with previous versions," Bosworth said. Yet, even with all this in mind, there's no sign active use will stop. "We plan on keeping our Lightning Network nodes up and running permanently to help support the network," said TorGuard CEO Ben Van Pelt. Finding bugs And that aligns with Lightning adopter David R. Sterry's defense of the active use of the in-development network, saying the criticism "isn't unanimous," and adding that developers "could have made it harder to do if [they were] really against it." He continued, "There are some issues you'll only find with real money." And mainnet testing has led to the uncovering of several bugs. According to the International Business Times, Blockstream's deployment of the tech led to the discovery of 20 bugs in the first 14 hours following its launch. And the CEO of TorGuard, Ben Van Pelt, told CoinDesk the company has encountered a few bugs along the way, but none that have caused the company or its users to lose money. In this same vein, CSO of Blockstream Samsom Mow tweeted : "Using Lightning Network on mainnet isn't just bug fixing, stickers and being #reckless. It's also learning about usability issues that we may not be considering." But Padiou thinks this overlooks an important point, saying once the network is live, "Every bug encountered will potentially be orders of magnitude more costly in terms of development resources. That's why on the way to a stable, working Lightning Network, rushing things will not make us actually go faster." The active network "just puts more pressure and adds more distraction to the already small number of people actually doing the development," he continued, adding: "Let's not forget that [developers] are the scarcest resource of all."

coindesk	bitcoins-price-drops-below-10000	Bitcoin's Price Drops Below $10,000 for First Time Since Early December - CoinDesk	2018-01-17T14:26	The price of bitcoin has fallen below $10,000 for the first time since early December. According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the cryptocurrency's value has hit a low of $9,714.02 as of press time. The last time bitcoin's price was below $10,000 was on Dec. 1, BPI data shows. As of the time of writing, the price had recovered somewhat, trading at $9,737.20. Market analysis suggests that the price could shift in either direction and recent regulatory developments – out of South Korea and China in particular – could roil markets further, according to some observers. Bitcoin's come comes amid the backdrop of a wider fall in cryptocurrency markets, a state of affairs which was on full display during yesterday's trading session. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that many of the top cryptocurrencies remain in the red for the past 24 hours, including ether, which has fallen below $900. By far the worst performer is the BitConnect cryptocurrency, which has plunged more than 90% on news that the company behind is moving to shutter its lending and exchange platform amid a wave of criticism and regulatory scrutiny. As it stands, the collective market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has dropped more than $200 billion since yesterday.

coindesk	bitgo-scores-43-million-series-b-crypto-goes-corporate	BitGo Scores $43 Million as Crypto Goes Corporate - CoinDesk	2017-12-11T14:00	BitGo, the maker of multi-signature cryptocurrency wallets for enterprises, has closed a $42.5 million Series B funding round in a sign that demand has at last arrived for institutional-grade services in the market. Led by Valor Equity Partners with participation from Bill Lee and David Sacks, the round of venture capital brings BitGo's total funding to more than $55 million, following a Series A in June 2014. As part of the investment, Antonio Gracias (who sits on the boards of SpaceX and Tesla) and Sacks (who co-founded PayPal and Yammer) will join BitGo's board of directors. Strategic investor Don Wilson, the founder of asset trader DRW and a co-founder of blockchain startup Digital Asset, will also join BitGo as an advisor. Announced today, the fundraising caps a transitional year for the veteran bitcoin startup, which was founded to serve businesses back in 2013 – long before this year's influx of institutional money helped drive the currency to record highs. As a result of that market maturation, BitGo turned a profit for the first time this year. Based in Palo Alto, CA., the firm was building institutional products when most other startups in the space were focused on bringing bitcoin to the masses. With clients such as CME Group, which is expected to launch a much-anticipated bitcoin futures product next week, BitGo now facilitates a total $8 billion-worth of bitcoin transactions per month, charging a fee on each one. In an interview, BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe discussed the firm's long path to achieving profitability and scoring one of the largest venture capital raises in the blockchain industry. All this time, Belshe said: "We've been behind the scenes plotting away, building a bigger, better system." Multi-coin support When BitGo was founded, it focused on enabling businesses to securely use bitcoin with wallets that require multiple cryptographic signatures to access. But over the years, the company has evolved to meet an institutional demand for both "hot" (online) and "cold" (offline) storage of six currencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash. With the new investment, Belshe said the company will be able to expand that pool of currencies by "at least" three in 2018 – and perhaps more importantly, to more quickly on-board new currencies that result from forks of existing ones. Currently, adding these spinoff currencies can sometimes take days or weeks to accommodate. In addition to supporting new currencies, Belshe indicated that BitGo intends to invest in helping develop and implement scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network, "that are able to drive off-chain payments" – something he says is crucial to helping his corporate clients build at scale. Lastly, Belshe spoke in broad terms about "a number" of other opportunities that will be explored as a result of the additional funding. One area he mentioned specifically included services that could be offered as a result of BitGo having a bird's-eye view of where transactions are coming from and going to. "What we see now is a big opportunity ahead," he said. "We know that it's going to take some strong growth, and we are aligning the resources that we need to be able to capitalize on that." Patience makes perfect BitGo was born the same year bitcoin's price surged from less than $100 to more than $1,000, before beginning a long slow decline in the wake of the Mt. Gox exchange collapse. As the industry emerged from that trough, largely due to retail purchases at exchanges like BTCC, Coinbase and Kraken, the institutional investors BitGo courted largely stayed on the sidelines. "We had a quiet 2014, a quiet 2015, 2016 started to grow a little bit, but still pretty quiet," said Belshe. "Then 2017, finally traditional finance and institutional investors are here. They are looking around desperately for, what do they do?" Surviving a hack of one of BitGo's largest clients in 2016, the company went on to become profitable for the first time earlier this year, largely thanks to a single revenue stream: the transaction fees charged to those using the hot wallets. A less significant amount of revenue comes from cold storage. While the privately held firm isn't sharing actual revenue or user numbers, Belshe said both are "strong," enabling BitGo to double the size of its team from 20 employees in January to 40 today. In spite of the patience Belshe and his team seem to have exhibited over the past few years, he maintains a humble stance when explaining this year's rapid expansion, saying: "The industry has grown, and it's made us strong with it."

coindesk	blockchain-bloat-ethereum-clients-tackling-storage-issues	Blockchain Bloat: How Ethereum Is Tackling Storage Issues - CoinDesk	2018-01-18T05:22	24,270 tokens. 27,358 pending transactions. 463,713 digital kittens. Ethereum has hosted a lot of activity recently, and while many crypto enthusiasts see that as a positive sign, as the network's usage soars, its history gets longer and its blockchain more unruly. And although network congestion leading to transaction backlogs and rising fees has taken the spotlight, there's another issue this scale causes – a growing database that puts significant storage costs on users wanting to run a full node. That database, called the ethereum state, hold all the computations that need to be memorized by the computers supporting the platform and the ethereum blockchain itself. And with the costs (both in time and money) of storing the state increasing, fewer and fewer people are choosing to run full nodes, which many worry will centralize the network into the hands of only a few arbitrators. And developers recognize the problem. For one thing, ethereum developers are well underway engineering protocol-level changes such as sharding, aimed at minimizing the database. But since these technologies are still in development, other stakeholders, namely those running ethereum clients – the software needed for users to communicate with the blockchain – have been under fresh pressure to cope with the growth of the state database. "The fact that improving this stuff is critical has been known since late 2016, the ideas have been floating around for half a year to over a year. Where are the implementations?" said ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin on a developer channel recently. The frustration is palpable with both Buterin and Afri Schoedon, who manages technical communications at ethereum software client provider Parity. Schoedon told CoinDesk: "At the current growth rate it's predictable that the state is going to grow very fast this year, to a point where it would be hardly manageable on small devices." In an effort to limit the effects of the unwieldy state, then, the two most popular ethereum clients – Geth and Parity – have recently released updates that attempt to improve the situation. Turbocharged The first update, released last week by Parity, reduced storage requirements by eliminating unnecessary, temporary files produced as the software memorizes ethereum's history. By vastly minimizing the storage requirements, users hooking up to run full nodes then experience faster synchronization times. And with that, the company said its ethereum software could now be run on a hard drive instead of a solid state drive (SSD), a particularly notable feat since long sync times have made ethereum unable to run on a hard drive since last summer. The update even got an excited response from Buterin, who said on a developer channel, "Wow. How did you guys accomplish that?" As a result of the update, users have been reporting a vastly improved experience. At the same time, independent developer Alexey Akhunov has been working on a rewrite of the geth client, called "turbo geth." Described by Akhunov as an "obsession," the project aims to remove a lot of unnecessary repetition in how ethereums' clients process the overall state. While it's nowhere near ready, it has opened up some interesting avenues of "speculative optimization," Akhunov said in a recent developer chat. For example, Akhunov suggests “hard coding” certain information about the ethereum state into the clients themselves. Ultimately, the goal is to adapt the software to simply run using random access memory, or RAM, which could make the clients much faster – allowing them to potentially synchronize with the network instantly. Developers at Geth itself are also working on optimizations, for one trying to correct a quirk in how information is stored when a client syncs with the network in what is called "fast" mode. Described by Geth core developer Péter Szilágyi as "really horrible," the existing code is likely to be replaced along with a whole bunch of updates that make synchronization much faster and less storage-intensive. The limits There's also research being done into a client type called "stateless clients," which only store a compression of the overall state. Even Buterin is interested in the idea, recently undertaking a study that describes a scenario where "miners and full nodes in general no longer need to store any state." Plus, Buterin said later in a developer channel, stateless clients would also alleviate the need to clear up the state by other measures, such as pruning old, irrelevant data, for example, empty or long-inactive accounts. "I'm now in favor of the stateless client approach," Buterin wrote. And there is even speculation that stateless clients might be possible without making protocol-level changes. Touting such clients as a possible solution to the scaling hurdles faced by ethereum following the success of CryptoKitties, Akhunov wrote in a recent blog post : "I believe (stateless clients) can be implemented already now, without any hard fork, 'simply' by changing the ethereum clients... This means that nodes do not need to access storage from files and block validation times should drop significantly." However, client optimizations can't be the only thing the network relies on to decrease state concerns. According to Szilágyi, eventually, client optimizations will reach their limit. And then developers will have to turn their attention to in-progress technologies, such as sharding, which splits up the ethereum database into smaller pieces stored at different nodes, in an effort to alleviate the pressure of storing the full database on individual clients. Perhaps in response to the recent strains on the network, sharding development has advanced in recent months, with an early stage specification sketched out on Github. "We can optimize the database and make it ten times faster and more optimal, which gives us room to grow to ten times our current size," Szilágyi said, adding: "But eventually, we will get to the point where we won't be able to do database optimizations anymore, and by that time we need to be able to shard our data."

coindesk	blockchain-bonanza-overstock-gets-100-million-investment-soros-fund	Overstock Gets $100 Million from Soros Fund for Blockchain and More - CoinDesk	2018-01-05T20:30	Overstock.com just got a hefty chunk of change from one of the biggest names in finance, and CEO Patrick Byrne says much of it will fund the company's blockchain work. The company disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing this week that the holder of a warrant had exercised its right to buy $100 million worth of shares. Although the filing did not identify this investor, Byrne told CoinDesk it was the Quantum Fund, managed by billionaire George Soros. Of the $100 million Overstock received, Byrne said he anticipates $20 million will fund DeSoto Inc., the blockchain property rights joint venture he is working on in partnership with economist Hernando DeSoto. As for the other $80 million, Byrne said he intends to invest the funds across Overstock's flagship e-commerce platform (which accepts bitcoin for payments) and the other blockchain ventures that are part of its Medici Ventures subsidiary. Yet, Byrne indicated he sees those two businesses working more closely in the future. "Maybe it’s about time we stop seeing Overstock as two separate businesses," he said. "Our retail platform had 40 million unique people come to it last month. So as we’re developing these blockchain applications, these blockchain companies, the retail business is an extremely valuable retail business to have in terms of bringing awareness and traffic to the blockchain properties that we anticipate developing." Byrne continued, telling CoinDesk: "By having the retail business involved, what we can really create is the wormhole between the two universes, the universe of conventional and the universe of crypto." Quantum Fund did not respond to requests for comment by press time, but the Soros-controlled vehicle disclosed its purchase of a warrant to buy Overstock shares in November. Byrne mentioned tZERO, Overstock's blockchain development platform for capital markets, as another area where some of the proceeds would be headed. But none of the Quantum investment will be used to purchase any of the crypto tokens issued in an initial coin offering (ICO) by tZERO in December. Separately, however, Overstock itself is buying $30 million worth of tZERO tokens with other funds, Byrne told CoinDesk. During the initial phase of its ongoing ICO, tZERO received $100 million in commitments from investors interested in purchasing the crypto tokens. Generally speaking, Overstock will be hiring people "across Wall Street with expertise in risk management," Byrne said.

coindesk	blockchain-day-big-pharma-seeks-dlt-solution-drug-costs	Big Pharma Seeks DLT Solution for Drug Costs - CoinDesk	2018-01-09T05:04	What if blockchain could be used to actually save lives? That's the thinking ongoing at pharmaceutical heavyweights Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi. The three companies – typically black boxes when it comes to their work – are now eyeing blockchain as a means of streamlining the process of developing and testing new drugs. Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk, representatives from the companies shed light on how they are combining efforts to develop a blockchain framework that can address current logjams in the clinical trials process. But while it might seem strange that these fierce competitors are interested in working together, according to Jaydev Thakkar, product innovation lead for digital health at Amgen, there is growing momentum to collaborate on foundational issues of industry-wide importance. Thakkar said: "[The focus is] to help each other so that running the engine of clinical research is as optimized as possible for each of us." In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have been put under more pressure to bring new, more personalized drugs to market faster and at more affordable prices and in a personalized fashion. But because of government regulations, the growing complexity of the studies undertaken and stringent standards, the current research and development process is highly cumbersome – with studies typically lasting between six and seven years. And about 90 percent of the drugs that enter clinical testing fail, according to Ken Getz of the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University, making the average cost of successfully developing a single drug about $2.6 billion. "The likelihood of recouping that $2.6 billion investment is much lower today than it was five years ago," Getz said. Yet, Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi believe blockchain can help. "This is about execution and operations models," said Munther Baara, senior director of development business technology at Pfizer. "It's all about collaboration." All about data Ultimately, reducing the length and cost of clinical trials and improving their success rate is dependent on one thing in particular: improved data management and movement. On that front, the pharmaceutical industry faces the same problem as does the rest of the U.S. healthcare system, the fact that most data is stored in proprietary data silos with limited interoperability and transferability. "The issue that we all struggle with in pharma is... the fact that data is fragmented. If you see five different physicians, you end up with data stored in five different systems," said Baara. And for pharma, the limited access to and portability of patient data means that locating and recruiting individuals who meet the eligibility criteria for a given trial is challenging. The current recruiting process involves hiring research organizations and investigators to beat the bushes, so to speak, by visiting physicians’ offices to find patients who qualify and are interested in participating in a study. The inverse is also frequently true, in that patients with diseases who want to participate in research often have difficulty being matched to an appropriate study. To bridge these gaps, a blockchain-based system could be used that allows individuals who want to participate in trials to aggregate their health data and make it visible to recruiters, according to the pharma executives. While the data on the ledger wouldn't immediately be connected to a particular identity, recruiters could prompt an anonymous eligible candidate, and once the individual consented, their identity would be revealed. Baara added: "The beauty with the blockchain is the control is with the individual." Circling back Yet, the individual is sometimes difficult to keep around. Because clinical studies typically span several years, retaining patients has also become a problem for the industry, particularly since entire studies can be invalidated if enough patients don’t show up within the required time window. As such, a blockchain-based conduit for patient interaction could offer immediate utility. "Today doctors and nurses running clinical trial programs are still having to resort to calls or post to remind patients about their appointments, which in this setting are particularly time-sensitive," said Dany DeGrave, senior director of innovation programs and external networks at Sanofi. "In the future, we envisage automation will make the whole process a lot more efficient." Not only do the executives think a blockchain system could automate communication between pharma company and patient, but they also think such a system would ensure the integrity of data. The latter is particularly important as regulatory approval for new drugs hinges on accurate data, and public trust in the pharma industry has ebbed and flowed over the years as stories of fabricated results make headlines. According to DeGrave, the immutable nature of blockchains could play a critical role in guarding against the falsification of data, and allow the public and other researchers better trust in the systems being used to track data. Currently, the three companies are working with the IEEE Standards Association, the standards body of the world’s largest technology association, to develop testbeds for implementing the technology and addressing the challenges. Regulators, for their part, also appear to be warming up to the concept. Representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, the primary agency overseeing the U.S. industry, will share their thoughts on the topic at an industry symposium in February. Getting it right But as many industries flirting with blockchain are discovering, finding a sweet spot for implementing the technology is never quite as simple as it may sound. Specifically in the healthcare setting, firmly entrenched legacy electronic health records vendors, like Epic and Cerner, could stand in the way, much to the chagrin of blockchain startups in the space. "We need to overcome any barriers to the conversion of health care data into blockchain by providing the right incentives to the incumbents, in order to fully and quickly realize the potential we see in this new technology," DeGrave said. That said, though, Pfizer's Baara expressed optimism that the trend of consumers demanding more control of their personal health data will, over time, incent the current data custodians to relax their stranglehold. Yet, costs associated with innovating in the space and the risk-averse nature of the heavily-regulated sector also means there's an additional imperative to make sure things go smoothly the first time around. "Like in any industry, we need to make sure the technology is mature enough before making sweeping changes to minimize any potential disruption," said DeGrave, concluding: "The costs associated with change in our industry are enormous, so we’d better get it right early on."

coindesk	blockchain-healthcare-2017s-successes	Blockchain in Healthcare: 2017's Successes - CoinDesk	2017-12-29T19:15	Katherine Kuzmeskas is the CEO of SimplyVital Health, a blockchain firm seeking to bring security and transparency to hospitals and physician groups through technology. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review. Entering 2018, two things are clear – 1) healthcare is ripe for disruption and 2) there is a massive opportunity for blockchain technology to lead this transformation. From medical records to the pharmaceutical supply chain to smart contracts for payment distribution, there are plenty of opportunities to leverage blockchain technology in healthcare. At the end of 2017, however, you'd be forgiven for thinking there hasn't been much progress. As an innovator working on this use case, though, I can say this is far from the case. Looking at three examples below, it is easy to identify why these projects have been successful: " big hairy audacious goals " rooted in initial practical implementations. While it may be difficult to hear, healthcare is a business. When making purchasing decisions, for-profit and not-for-profit healthcare companies need to use the same logic every firm does, by asking, "How will this product bring efficiency or savings?" The three companies below brought their products to market by focusing on an immediate, existing need in healthcare that had an existing business model opportunity. The MediLedger Project Led by The LinkLab and Chronicled, the MediLedger Project kicked off in 2017, successfully bringing competing pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers to the same table. Together, they designed and implemented a process for using blockchain technology to improve the track-and-trace capabilities for prescription medicine. Built to support the requirements of the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), MediLedger also outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs, meaning it successfully met not just the law, but the operational needs of industry. Two key takeaways: the vision for the industry is an open system architecture, with nodes operated by a variety of key companies in the industry – supply chain participants, service providers for the industry and trusted technology companies. To make this open network happen, those involved were able to develop a blockchain solution that allows full privacy, no leakage of business intelligence, while still allowing the capability of drug verification and provenance reporting. The working group will continue in 2018 to develop the vision and governance for such an industry platform as well as launch a commercial solution. They will continue to explore how such a platform could transform the pharmaceutical supply chain. Learn more here. SimplyVital Health Launched in February 2017, we started with what we considered a practical implementation of blockchain: an audit trail. Our product, ConnectingCare brings providers together from different clinical organizations onto the same platform, where they can view the same data for shared patients. Financial and clinical algorithms powered by AI provide actionable strategic opportunities for all users. Together, providers work to drive down the cost of care, which means providers are paid for working together and for results. Because reimbursement depends on the ability to prove they worked together, the immutable audit trail provides extra upside for the users. Now with a track record of credibility, we are building Health Nexus: the blockchain infrastructure and protocol we hope will be safely adoptable by healthcare. A fork of ethereum, the offering combines a new validation and governance protocol focusing on HIPAA compliance and a key pair system built into the protocol for safe data sharing. Up first is linking and growing ConnectingCare, and then developing healthcare data marketplace, which is the most requested feature by our community. Learn more here. Robomed Network Robomed Network is a decentralized medical network designed to provide the most effective medical care. The project's uniqueness lies in connecting healthcare service providers and patients, based on a smart contract, the value criteria of which are the clinical pathways. This particular breakthrough concept of focusing on patient outcomes is brand new to the healthcare market. In other words, Robomed Network is the first system where the patient pays for the result and not the medical process itself. Launched first in Russia and Dubai, Robomed boasts nearly 9,000 patients, 30,500 services and nearly $2 million worth of services. As the healthcare market continues to shift to value-based care (payment for results instead of payment for number of procedures), solutions such as Robomed that bridge the gap between provider and patient, will continue to gain traction.

coindesk	blockchain-id-schemes-could-kill-the-data-breach-but-how-soon	Blockchain ID Schemes Could Kill the Data Breach, But How Soon? - CoinDesk	2017-11-11T13:00	Awareness of the serious drawbacks of centralized identity services is growing. Spurred by the Equifax breach earlier this year, the problem isn't relegated to the U.S. credit scoring company alone. In mid-October, a database leaked the personal information of more than 30 million South Africans (more than half the population). Further, searching "data breach" in Google news turns up a significant recent data breaches globally. Yet, a new breed of entrepreneurs believes that by updating the underlying technology used by such services, consumer data can be better protected. "This move to the cloud and greater digitization of government services has led to greater centralization," said Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger. And if something isn't done to distribute that data, the lead developer of one of the largest blockchain consortiums, one boasting membership from IBM, Baidu, Intel and more, believes breaches will continue. This is the main reason Behlendorf believes stakeholders are more interested in exploring self-sovereign identity – a means of decentralizing identifying information so that the individual has control over their own data. The concept of a self-sovereign ID has "been percolating for awhile," he said, but it wasn’t until the advent of distributed ledger technology that the notion started to feel somewhat attainable. Behlendorf told CoinDesk: "You're using [distributed ledgers] simply to store addresses, pointers and hashes to data that is stored off-chain elsewhere. Recognition of that basic model is starting to become clear to the different organizations in [the identity] space." While it's still early days, several stakeholders have taken the lead, with governments seeming most interested in utilizing blockchain technology to shape the future of identity management. Governmental momentum And that's what's perhaps most notable. Governments aren't typically recognized as first movers, but some are proving responsive to a solution that might allow them to offload some of the risk of storing large silos of citizens' data. For instance, the state of Illinois, through the Illinois Blockchain Initiative (IBI), is exploring how it can implement blockchain technology in areas like land titles and birth certificates. According to Jennifer O’Rourke, Illinois' blockchain business liaison, "Moving to a model where you as an individual are responsible for your information as opposed to institutions carrying that responsibility was very interesting for us." In a birth certificates trial, Illinois partnered with blockchain firm Evernym, which uses the non-profit Sovrin Foundation's blockchain. "I think we're starting to see a significant amount of momentum here, where the number of calls that we're getting from our counterparts at both state and sovereign level to learn from the works that we have done has increased dramatically," O'Rourke told CoinDesk, adding: "It is clear that many people are focused on this in the government sector." The Brazilian government's Ministry of Planning is also exploring a number of identity management use cases, recently piloting a program with ConsenSys' uPort using the ethereum blockchain. And IBM – in the midst of an identity pilot with SecureKey and a number of Canadian banks – is seeing interest from government agencies as well. "We've gotten interest from the U.S. and other countries that want to do something similar so we're in discussions now with interested parties in those regions on how can expand what we're doing," Adam Gunther, director of blockchain identity offerings at IBM, said. Hurdles for adoption But with that interest also comes concern. Many blockchain-based ID systems rely on decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which hold unique metadata that proves ownership of a particular ID. So, in Illinois' birth certificate proof-of-concept, the actual birth certificate does not get stored on the blockchain, and the DIDs are meaningless outside one interaction. And there aren't yet standards for use case, which makes these kinds of frameworks even more complex to understand and utilize. IBM's Gunther believes DIDs need to be standardized in case of loss or theft. The reason? So they work more similarly to the way credit cards do, where consumers are able to call up a company responsible for safeguarding the data to see if it has been stolen. "Then the damage someone can do with that is much less significant," he said. "We need that same type of identity standard." Another concern is that, with an ever-increasing number of blockchains, a stakeholder chooses the one that doesn't get the most traction in the end. Here, groups are also working on standards, in an effort to make blockchain ID systems interoperable. “I don't believe we will have only one blockchain platform used by the government in Brazil,” said Vinicius de Faria Silva, coordinator-general of the division within the country's Ministry of Planning responsible for its blockchain work. He continued, "Of course, there are a lot of questions, a lot of doubts, I don't think [the concerns are] about security, much more about how to use this technology, how to implement the solutions and how this will grow throughout time." Regulatory triggers Yet, some of these questions could be answered by new regulations. Behlendorf is hoping Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be a catalyst for greater adoption of blockchain-based self-sovereign ID systems. "It's far easier to meet the GDPR requirements when you're collecting data from individuals and … minimizing data you store," he said. "You're keeping the consumer informed about that data, giving them a chance to inspect it, correct it, that sort of thing." Behlendorf also sees a kind of chicken-and-egg problem in the space. "Who would adopt it with enough distribution for it to be worth people moving to?" he asks. Regulation, as it has in the past with financial services technology, could spur a resolution. But many, including Evernym's chief trust officer Drummond Reed, remain optimistic. Reed told CoinDesk: "This is going to be like the adoption of the web. It didn't happen overnight, but it's going to be inevitable."

coindesk	blockchain-move-self-driving-cars-fast-lane	How Blockchain Tech Could Move Self-Driving Cars Into the Fast Lane - CoinDesk	2017-05-25T11:30	A future with autonomous vehicles is fast approaching – and with it, the idea that blockchain could connect automobiles and other Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is getting its fair share of attention. Even though smart houses (where doors, thermostats and appliances are connected to the internet for added functionality) may have seemed more trendy a year ago, blockchain startups are becoming drawn to the potential of connected cars. "Timing is everything," said John Gerryts, co-founder and CEO at Oaken. "Now is the perfect time to begin building this stuff out." He went on to explain: "Everyone is in turn with it and on the same page with autonomous vehicles being within reach, depending on who you talk to, in the next 5–10 years." The "stuff" Gerryts is talking about includes developing a mechanism that would allow autonomous vehicles to be truly autonomous. This means that a car could refuel, recharge and park on its own – and pay for those services as well. Opportunity at the edge Most entrepreneurs in the self-driving car space, said Gerryts, are focused on mobility. However, Oaken is focused on the layers and support systems that could underlie this operation. To the startup, these edges of the industry could use smart contracts running on a blockchain to connect everything. Plus, cars equipped with a repository of cryptocurrency could purchase services – say, a tune-up or an oil change – using an instantaneous and inexpensive payment rail. Oaken sees itself taking care of the attestation of vehicles, inputting data on the blockchain to give vehicles a kind of digital identity. Once this identity is in place, Oaken can use GPS to follow the car, time-stamping its location on the blockchain. The data gleaned from the connection of the vehicle to the internet, such as seasonality and traffic patterns, can also be used by consumers, application developers and manufacturers. "If everyone had everyone else’s data it would be a faster path to autonomous cars," according to James Johnson, cofounder and chief marketing officer at Oaken. He said: "If these [original equipment manufacturers] and others want to accelerate the path to level-five autonomous driving, the best way to do that is through the blockchain to share all that data." But before autonomous cars, Oaken is looking to equip today's cars, those that could be manned by a human with the ability to purchase services using cryptocurrency. The company recently built out a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a United Arab Emirates-sponsored hackathon, which won first place. The project allowed Tesla cars to pay road tolls over the ethereum network. While nothing commercial has come out of the PoC yet, Gerryts said, the company has been head’s down on the project for the Toyota Research Institute, which announced this week that it will form a consortia with multiple blockchain startup partners to focus on potential uses of blockchain. Oaken has also been developing a system for short-term vehicle leasing. Whether it's individuals, manufacturers or other companies with fleets, the firm wants to find a way to allow them to rent out or lease vehicles in exchange for payment. And all that data and monetary transfer will happen over a blockchain. The startup has come up with a decentralized application (dapp) on the ethereum testnet that allows people to register their vehicles for short-term lease, and one at the other end that allows people to go in and sign up to lease those vehicles. With the announcement, Oaken and the other blockchain startups in the Toyota consortium – including Gem, BigchainDB and Commuterz – aim to capture the interest of large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). That effort, they hope, will help get the blockchain-connected hardware into vehicles' components before market. Unlocking the middleman's money Uber’s valuation is more than $60bn, and all the company does is act as a matchmaker. Johnson asked: “What if there was a direct relationship between the vehicle owner and the consumer?” By cutting out Uber or Lyft as the middleman, drivers would make more money without the up-to-20% fee they charge, and consumers would get cheaper rides. All manufacturers and OEMs are looking at how to get a piece of this pie. And while manufacturers might be selling less cars, Johnson continued, they’ll get more revenue per car – or rather than selling cars, offer pay-per-use models. Further, as Oaken is thinking about the future of smart cities, it makes sense to utilize the roadways for ride-sharing, because, in most US cities, there are about 100 times more roads than there are mass transit lines, Johnson said. “The opportunity is so big that I think all these different players in the [blockchain] space are now trying to get that solution built,” Johnson told CoinDesk. Reinventing insurance One area that will absolutely change as short-term leasing of individual cars becomes more popular is car insurance. “Insurance has always been built with 12 months in mind,” said Johnson. “Now, we’re building insurance products for five minutes or 20 minutes.” Many experts have predicted a move towards usage-based insurance (UBI) or 'pay as you drive' (PAYD), not only because of short-term leasing, but because of the proliferation of telematic devices and smartphones that can be used to monitor the driving behaviors of individuals in an effort to give them discounts or better premiums for good driving. “Usage-based insurance will be dynamic enough to charge you less on Tuesdays than Wednesdays if you're a better driver on the former day,” said Gerryts. The problem with these models is that insurance is supposed to be a pooling mechanism for distributing costs across multiple people and, in turn, keeping them down. Plus, telematic monitoring can sometimes put certain demographics at a disadvantage. For instance, most insurers will dock points for driving late at night into the early morning because statistically speaking that’s when most accidents happen. However, this puts people that work late-night and overnight shifts at a disadvantage. However, Toyota’s insurance entity is also part of the research initiative, so these challenges are being worked through, according to Gerryts. Johnson said: “The discrimination of usage-based insurance – autonomous cars could solve this.” Futuristic car image via Shutterstock margin-top: 30px; padding-top: 10px; color: #aeaeae; font-style: italic;"> The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

coindesk	blockchain-pocket-phone-behind-sirins-157-million-ico	Blockchain in Your Pocket? The Phone Behind Sirin's $157 Million ICO - CoinDesk	2018-01-12T13:00	Does the world really need a blockchain phone? Sirin Labs is betting it does. The startup, which recently raised $157 million in an initial coin offering (ICO), is building an Android smartphone from scratch with special features for cryptocurrency enthusiasts: an app store for distributed apps (dapps), cold storage for private keys and easy conversion between tokens. The Switzerland-based company says the product will fill a need in a fast-growing market: a secure device that can simplify the use of cryptocurrency across multiple applications. But as an old tech adage goes, "hardware is hard," and in blockchain it may be even harder, since devices must be engineered to protect not only information but unrecoverable money. In a nod to the device's target audience, Sirin has dubbed the phone "Finney," after computer scientist and bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney. Estimating this audience's growth over the years, Sirin Labs CEO Moshe Hogeg told CoinDesk: "You have more than 10 million people that are all in crypto in one way or another. I think the community will at least double in size by the end of this year." The phone is expected to retail just shy of $1,000, putting it in the high-end range with the likes of Apple's iPhone. And it can only be purchased using Sirin's crypto token (based on the ERC-20 standard). The firm sold 40 percent of the 573 million total tokens it created during the recent ICO. As an Android device, the phone will include all the usual applications, including the full Google Play store. As Hogeg explained, "We're talking about user experience. If you don't have Facebook then forget about it." But what makes Finney different is that sirin tokens will also be stored on the device to facilitate payments for a wide variety of dapps. Crypto app store The decentralized app store on the Finney phone will provide users with access to a whole host of dapps – the products of a host of blockchain-based projects that have issued tokens via ICOs. These could include blockchain-based alternatives to popular tech companies such as Uber, which Hogeg said would be better for users by connecting providers directly to customers, reflecting the industry ethos. As such, the Finney would provide a one-stop shop for crypto enthusiasts to browse through dapps and spend their crypto on products and services. And through a partnership with Bancor, the decentralized liquidity market that raised $150 million last June in an ICO, Sirin's software will convert users' sirin tokens to whatever cryptocurrency is needed for a particular transaction. "A user shouldn't care about technology. He shouldn't care about how things work. He should care about the value of them," said Hogeg. Hence, "the experience should be simple." Simplicity will be a prerequisite for these token-based platforms to gain traction, he said. "If we want those technologies to become mainstream, we have to fix this issue of multiple tokens," Hogeg said. "Our software is going to allow the user to seamlessly convert between different tokens within our phones." Sirin faces some competition in the decentralized app store arena. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstong is also working on a browser for dapps called Toshi. In a recent Medium post, Armstrong similarly talked about the need for one platform for consumers to manage dapps. Yet, while Coinbase's solution wouldn't need specialized hardware, Hogeg said he believes that by the time these decentralized marketplaces are ready, early adopters will want a distinct device to safely store the cryptocurrency they'll use. And while it's proven to be difficult to get developers to switch from the two marketplaces currently dominating mobile (the Apple store and the Google Play store) to a new development platform, Hogeg said he has a way to convince them. "We raised enough money to incentivize a community of developers," he said. Security focus But while Hogeg has a plan for incentivizing developers, the harder part might be luring consumers to purchase the pricey device. But he says that for crypto users, the phone's security features will be hard to resist. Not only does the Finney phone use behavioral monitoring to detect possible exploitation, it also allows for multiple types of biometric identification and comes with cybersecurity protection from the operating system through the application layer, according to Sirin. All of these features, Hogeg admitted, can be found in one form or another on other devices, but there's one feature on the phone that stands out: cold storage. The Finney phone allows users to disconnect their cryptocurrency's private keys from the rest of the device and from the internet, Sirin says. This provides added protection since hackers would have to physically go to the phone's storage vault where the private keys are held to get access. Hogeg told CoinDesk: "I think it will differentiate us. I think it's unique, and it will grow." But Peter Todd, a prominent cryptography consultant and bitcoin developer, was skeptical about the effectiveness of cold storage in this context, telling CoinDesk, "Why does that protect you? You need to connect to the internal electronics to accomplish anything anyway, at which point the attack can happen." Still, a spokesperson for Sirin contended cold storage still reduces risk, which is why people use crypto-wallets like Trezor and Ledger. He explained, "We do all the signature 'foreplay' in advance of the actual signature" – that is, making the connection as brief as possible. "This is a well known cyber security methodology of decreasing the attack surface and time exposure," he wrote. Further, even Hogeg acknowledges that security doesn't sell hardware. So Sirin is also setting up the devices to be able to cooperate and share resources, for instance, in a way that allows strangers can pay each other in microtransactions for borrowing computing power or bandwidth. Renderings of the Finney mobile phone. Image courtesy of Sirin Labs. The tangle Yet that raises another issue. In Sirin's whitepaper, these services lean heavily on the "Tangle," a technology pioneered by the distributed ledger startup IOTA. Pitched as a solution tailor-made for the internet of things, IOTA requires devices to make a few proof-of-work computations in order to participate in the chain, rather than pay a fee to miners as with bitcoin. "This is how we allow it to be fee-less," Hogeg said. Yet, IOTA and its technology have been a flashpoint of controversy since over-the-counter trading of its cryptocurrency began in 2016. For instance, MIT Media Lab actually disputed the claims in an MIT Technology Review article describing the security of IOTA. Further, the lab's Digital Currency Initiative found a serious security flaw in Iota in September. The IOTA Foundation acknowledged the researchers' work, while arguing that it did not represent a realistic attack and said it has always planned to submit its final cryptographic design, once ready, to academic review in order to insure its solidity. Val A. Red, a security researcher with experience in IoT systems, told CoinDesk that any blockchain-based application raises issues. "If I were looking at this outside of cryptocurrencies and from the perspective of a secure mobile or BYOD [bring-your-own-device] network administrator, I would also have reasonable concerns looking at a proposal involving interoperability with IOTA or any digital ledger technology in production." Hogeg didn't dispute that there are doubts about the protocol at present, but said, "Maybe we're going to change to a different fee-less network, and there are a bunch who are talking about it. Probably it's going to be IOTA." Although he continued, "We are not going to announce 100 percent it is IOTA until we are 100 percent satisfied." Hogeg confirmed that IOTA is not an investor in Sirin. Next steps But even with the Finney project's blockchain architecture still up in the air, Hogeg is confident the phone will be released by the end of this year. And, he said, prototypes of the device should be available soon at retail stores the company plans to open in cities around the world, where people will be able to pre-order phones and talk to staff about its structure. That may sound expensive, but remember that Sirin raised $157 million in its token sale, triple what it initially estimated it would need to develop the phone. Also in the works is a Finney PC, based on the Android OS. If this all sounds overambitious, it's worth noting that Hogeg has been effective at generating chatter around his projects. In 2014, he created the joke app Yo, a messaging app that initially only allowed users to send the single word "yo" back and forth. Around the same time, he snagged backing from Leonardo DiCaprio, Lance Armstrong and Serena Williams for his short-form video service, Mobli. At Sirin, he has already had some success in manufacturing mobile devices, building a privacy-oriented Android phone called Solarin, which came with a $13,800 retail price tag. Still, his projects have also not matured without some stumbling blocks. In 2016, even though it had some real traction, Mobli was shut down, and in early 2017, Sirin laid off 30 percent of its staff after sales of the Solarin phone failed to support the business model (they are still sold, though). But according to Hogeg, the way in which the software for Finney was built, allowing other Android manufacturers to use it in their devices as well, hedges the company's bet on building a piece of hardware from the ground up. Addressing the uncertainty of the business, but also his optimism going forward, Hogeg concluded: "Could be that we will become a very big phone manufacturer. Could be. Could be, also, that phone manufacturers will use our software … and we give them everything we do for free, as long as they use our token as the engine for everything."

coindesk	blockchain-startup-colu-raises-14-5-million-new-funding	Colu Mixes VC and ICO for $14.5 Million Fundraise - CoinDesk	2017-12-13T17:00	Blockchain startup Colu has secured $14.5 million in new funding from a major business group in Israel. IDB Group contributed the funds both toward the company itself as well as the token presale for its Colu Local Network (CLN), which it unveiled last month. The company – Israel's largest holding company – is involved in the finance and insurance sectors, and the partnership between the two firms will focus in part on retail payments. In statements, IDB indicated that the results of its work with Colu could wind up in products and services offered through its various business holdings. Sholem Lapidot, CEO of IDB Development Corporation, said of the deal: "IDB believes that Colu will help to support the growth of blockchain technology as a [real-life] payment method. We strongly believe that crypto technology will play a key role in the future form of payment for goods and services and we are thrilled to be rolling out plans for increased innovation in our diverse industries, with the help of Colu." The CLN token, according to Colu, is intended to be used as a basis for local transacting, while at the same time serving as a kind of reward for retail payments. "Partnering with IDB group is a vote of confidence in cryptocurrencies and the role they could play in the retail market," Amos Meiri, Colu co-founder and CEO, said in a statement. That work on localized currencies was highlighted last year when Colu raised $9.6 million from a group of investors that included Aleph, Spark Capital, Digital Currency Group and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer.

coindesk	blockchain-startup-sun-exchange-raises-1-6-million-new-seed-funding	Blockchain Startup Sun Exchange Raises $1.6 Million in New Seed Funding - CoinDesk	2017-10-19T21:45	Blockchain startup Sun Exchange has raised $1.6 million in new seed funding. The company drew support from a number investors, including Network Society Ventures, Kalon Venture Partners, and startup accelerators BoostVC, Techstars and Powerhouse. Back in September 2016, Sun Exchange was one of a batch of blockchain startups to join the Plug 'n Play startup accelerator. Sun Exchange's platform uses blockchain as a way to let users rent out solar panels, with assets being recorded on a blockchain and payments made through cryptocurrency. In comments, the startup said that it aims to democratize access to solar power, as well as boost access for those looking to capitalize on interest in consumer-grade renewable energy. Sun Exchange CEO Abraham Cambridge said in a statement: "[Solar power] is the fastest growing source of energy, but billions of people don’t own their own roof or have the capital to get it. By breaking down solar panel ownership to a single cell we reduce the cost of going solar by two orders of magnitude and we’re utilizing empty roof space in some of the sunniest cities on the planet, such as Dubai and Johannesburg." Though accelerators like BoostVC and Techstars are no strangers to investing in blockchain startups, the seed funding appears to be a first in the industry for both Network Society Ventures and the South Africa-based Kalon.

coindesk	blockchain-voting-code-made-open-source-moscows-government	Moscow Government Open-Sources Blockchain Voting Tool - CoinDesk	2017-12-04T20:30	The government of Moscow is pushing ahead with plans to test blockchain for use in local voting initiatives. Last year, officials from Moscow's government told local media that they were looking into the technology in a bid to reduce the risk of fraud when people are voting on city management issues. The possible use would come as part of its "Active Citizen" e-government project, constituting one of several areas in which blockchain is being explored (including as a basis for a new land registry system ). Now, according to a Dec. 4 statement, officials have developed a pilot system for tracking votes via blockchain, declaring that the tech would make its ongoing Active Citizen program "more open" according to a translated statement. The government explained: "The introduction of this technology will make the voting in the [Active Citizen initiative] even more open: it will be difficult to say that the administration incorrectly interprets the answers, changes the results of the voting when the citizens themselves can verify this information." In addition to the public announcement, the government made the code behind the pilot solution open-source on GitHub. The statement itself doesn't offer any clear indication that the use of blockchain-based voting will extend beyond the pilot phase. Yet the area is one that has attracted interest from Russia's private sector as well, including its central securities depository which began testing blockchain proxy voting – allowing shareholders to issue votes on corporate decisions – last year. Editor's Note: Some of the statements in this report have been translated from Russian.

coindesk	blockchains-forever-diamond-giant-de-beers-unveils-dlt-strategy	Blockchains Are Forever? Diamond Giant De Beers Unveils DLT Strategy - CoinDesk	2017-12-04T17:51	One of the world's most well-known diamond companies is getting into blockchain by investing in an asset tracking platform. De Beers, its chief executive announced today, is planning to use the tech in a bid to boost transparency across the diamond supply chain. The firm, the world's largest miner of diamonds, says it wants to use the tracking platform in order to rebuild trust in the diamond distribution process – as well as alleviate concerns over money laundering and the broader trafficking of conflict diamonds. CEO Bruce Cleaver unveiled the initiative in a blog post published earlier today, writing: "This diamond traceability platform is underpinned by blockchain technology, which allows for a highly secure digital register that creates a tamper-proof and permanent record of interactions – in this instance, a diamond’s path through the value chain." Cleaver outlined a number of characteristics that the platform will possess, including privacy controls for participants and wide access to potential users. As it stands, the system doesn't have a firm launch date, though Cleaver indicated that the development process would play out over the coming months and involve input from stakeholders. "In the months ahead, we will continue to work with leaders from across the industry and share our progress with you," Cleaver wrote. "In the process we will no doubt make some mistakes, but we will continue to collaborate, learn and persevere." That De Beers is moving in this direction is perhaps unsurprising, given work in this area by industry startups as well as international bodies like the United Nations. In September 2016, the group behind the Kimberly Process, an initiative which seeks to keep conflict diamonds out of global markets, said that it was l ooking to apply blockchain as part of a way to track diamond trade statistics.

coindesk	blockchains-will-turn-supply-chains-demand-chains	How Blockchains Will Turn Supply Chains Into Demand Chains - CoinDesk	2017-11-03T12:00	Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative. In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey argues that the value blockchain technology offers to supply-chain management will come once other technologies, such as 3D printing, bring major disruption to global manufacturing and delivery networks. Blockchains are a technology of tomorrow, not today. That is not an excuse to ignore them, however. On the contrary, the future to which blockchains belong is coming so fast that a failure to properly strategize and to consider the widest range of design possibilities could eventually prove fatal for many businesses. This is especially so in supply-chain management, a field that deals with the plumbing of the global economy: how a good's production moves sequentially through the manufacturing processes of separately owned businesses before it is delivered to the end-user. A combination of new technologies – artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, the internet of things, mobile money, digital identity and, most importantly, 3D printing – is poised to seriously disrupt these underlying processes. They'll make manufacturing more responsive and customizable to customer's orders – in effect, turning supply chains into demand chains. But this dynamism will only be realized if they also adopt the kind of decentralized trust mediation model promised by blockchains. Supply-chain managers are typically found only at big, downstream companies, such as Walmart. These experts have real influence in the management of many consumer brands. Smaller upstream players occupying spots earlier on in the chain are outgunned by the bigger players and generally can’t influence the activities of others enough to warrant employing a supply-chain manager. Yet, ironically, improved chain transparency and visibility from better supply-chain management would help them gain bargaining power vis-à-vis the big guys. So, when we hear about supply chain managers giving thought to blockchain solutions to their problems, it's worth remembering where they are coming from: they represent large buyer companies and tend to view their supply chain proprietarily. They see it as an exclusive club over which they control access, one with a clearly defined, existing set of members. It's a static vision, not a dynamic one, and it's marked by a power imbalance in their favor. Static vision, static choices From that perspective, it's understandable –in fact, appropriate – that many are asking why they should bother with the cat-herding challenge of getting their supply-chain partners to jointly create a complicated, costly, multi-node computing network to run a distributed blockchain ledger. Often they discover they can address many supply-chain information-management problems, including improving the tracking of inventory and work processes, with well-established database tools that already run internally on their company’s servers. As Gideon Greenspan, CEO of Coin Sciences, has warned, "If your requirements are fulfilled by today's relational databases, you’d be insane to use a blockchain." Firms that operate in supply chains where power is more balanced, where middle-size firms have some clout and too much to lose by submitting information to the centralized control of the biggest player, might instead conclude that a blockchain is useful. A distributed, immutable ledger could help different stakeholders overcome their inherent mistrust of each other, which could boost efficiency and visibility along the chain. Yet here, too, the scope tends to be limited. Since the supply chain is viewed as a club with pre-existing, pre-approved members, chain managers have a hard time grasping why they would submit their transaction-sharing processes to a fully decentralized network and a permissionless blockchain such as bitcoin or ethereum. They'd much prefer to form a consortium and jointly validate the private distributed ledger. They see other advantages in private blockchains, too: the permissioned structure allows much more transaction capacity than public blockchains; upgrades can be easily agreed to and trivially implemented; identity, privacy and other natural concerns of businesses can be addressed in ways that public blockchains cannot. But in an era of rapid technological change that poses an existential threat for legacy businesses, it's unwise to assume a static business environment. Many people know the Kodak story. There's a risk that a permissioned blockchain, based on a consortium managed by existing, pre-approved suppliers, would evolve into a rigid, gatekeeping entity. Members would be incentivized to limit access to outsiders with competing products and new ideas. And while that might protect the chain members’ margins for a while, it would ultimately render the whole chain less competitive. It might not be a huge risk now, but, as mentioned, things are changing. Rapidly. The supply chains of the future will be much more dynamic, flexible and customer-responsive than those of the present. Geography and longstanding relationships will be less of issue. This suggests that supply chain managers should not only be looking at blockchains but also striving for the most open, permissionless model they can handle. They might not need to adopt bitcoin or ethereum per se; I could even be persuaded that a permissioned network of validators might still preserve a decentralized, competitive landscape if the consortium’s governance rules steadfastly allowed any new supplier to write data to the ledger. Either way, the bottom line is that openness and permissionlessness are vitally important ideals to strive for, precisely because they encourage competition and innovation. Decentralized trust Taken together, new manufacturing technologies such as IoT and 3D-printing contain enormous decentralizing potential. By empowering people and businesses to do more with less, they reduce transaction costs, which means they can break down barriers to entry and challenge the economies of scale that have hitherto advantaged big, centralized companies. If we can prevent the data-gathering behemoths of the internet 2.0 era from monopolizing them, these tools should help level the playing field. They should open the door to to a wider array of potential producers in the global economy. But to reach its optimal potential, that decentralized, more horizontal economic structure will also require a decentralized trust model. The cost of having a single company verify the trustworthiness of an ever-widening array of potential business partners will be too high for any supply chain to remain competitive. Let’s imagine a world in which 3D printing – known as additive manufacturing in the industrial world – is ubiquitous. Now imagine a German auto-parts producer receiving a request for quotes from an Argentine car assembler, a customer it has never previously dealt with, and for delivery in two days. The German company knows it’s highly likely that competing manufacturers in the U.S., Brazil, India and South Korea have also received offers. The only way to meet the order is to tap a hitherto untested 3D-printing company in Buenos Aires. How can it trust this supplier? The time and cost of applying current due diligence, credentialing and approval procedures to onboard this company into an approved list of suppliers would take too long and cost too much money. It would leave the German company outcompeted for the job. As supply chains start to function more like the demand chain of this scenario, trust dilemmas like this may force manufacturers to look to blockchain solutions. There's a lot of work going into how to use blockchain-based input logs and unique identifiers to prove the veracity of data emanating from interconnected devices such as 3D printers. Applying a similar change-of-state log for alterations to software, blockchains could also assure users that the code in a particular file used to print the relevant part complies with the specifications as advertised, that it hasn’t been tampered with. Cryptographic proofs of the integrity of a 3D-printing process may well allow manufacturers to hire a supplier in minutes, whereas previously they could never do so without face-to-face meetings. This kind of blockchain model could greatly speed up the onboarding process. But it would need to be based on permissionless, open access for new suppliers. The changes we're talking about are step up from the 1990s round of disruption and decentralization that came with the advent of the Internet and globalization. Those trends created a wider pool of potential suppliers, disintegrating decades-old supply chains. New IT technologies like 3D printing are an extension, or perhaps an acceleration, of the disruption unleashed then when the Internet decentralized the information-gathering process and removed barriers to communication. The next big step-function change will come from decentralizing the trust barrier. That's the prism through which the boldest, most innovative manufacturers should be viewing blockchains and their critical role in the global economy of the future.

coindesk	blythe-masters-asx-blockchain-embrace-precedent-setting	Blythe Masters: ASX Blockchain Embrace 'Precedent Setting' - CoinDesk	2017-12-07T07:00	Would ASX upgrade? After months of waiting, the markets finally have an answer, as the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), the nation's largest domestic stock exchange, has officially revealed it will upgrade its post-trade settlement system, CHESS, using a blockchain platform designed by startup Digital Asset. Long considered one of the front-runners in the race to prove blockchain tech's benefits for global financial infrastructures, the startup headed by former head of global commodities at JPMorgan Blythe Masters had already raised $110 million from a diverse set of industry leaders to prove out the use case. But despite months and years of trials, what remained to be seen was whether the promise of moving a major global securities exchange to a shared, distributed ledger was worth the cost. And if ASX is to be believed, that's precisely the case, with the company calling t he costs "marginal." That hurdle now behind, what happens next could be the large-scale migration of financial infrastructures to a distributed ledger, according to Masters. In interview with CoinDesk, Masters said the decision not only proves the technology but proves it's ready for the most daunting enterprise challenges. "It's absolutely a precedent-setting event," she said, adding: "It's the first time that distributed ledger technology has been given a validation by a major systemically important market infrastructure whose standards from an enterprise point of view are as exacting as they can be." Background and future Yet it's perhaps all the more impressive as the effort to replace ASX’s Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, or CHESS for short, began long before blockchain was even on the company's radar. In fact, ASX had already set out to upgrade its aging system by the time it first met with Digital Asset in 2015, according to ASX CEO Dominic Stevens, speaking at the press event last night. But with the advent of distributed ledger technology, the potential to not only upgrade the system but create entirely new services became a serious point of interest to the exchange. By using a similar payment messaging system as is currently in place, but anonymized and accounted for on a distributed ledger, a wide range financial products that rely on automated settling can now be created, Stevens said. To enable that functionality, ASX partnered with Digital Asset and even become one of its early investors, and in remarks yesterday, Stevens indicated the company is increasing its commitment to the startup. In a move that stands to help offset some of ASX’s own expenses if the technology is widely adopted, the exchange is opting to take up its pro-rata right to participate in Digital Asset's recent Series B financing. According to a statement provided to CoinDesk, the total amount raised by Digital Asset to date after that investment is now over $115 million, making the additional fund worth about $5 million based on the previously reported numbers. Toward implementation Going forward, the CHESS platform will be upgraded to serve what Stevens called ASX’s $1.5 trillion-$2 trillion securities business, with a possible implementation on the exchange’s $2 trillion cash debt market at some point in the future (though he added that was not currently being discussed). Still, any move is likely to create a shake-up elsewhere in finance, as other stock exchanges haven’t exactly been lying in wait with their own blockchain research. Nasdaq, for example, has taken a leading role in moving private stocks to a blockchain, TMX Group has launched a beta for trading natural gas and many other exchanges have experimented to a lesser degree innovating on the edges of their operations. However, before any of that can happen, ASX needs to further prepare the Digital Asset platform for live trades. To do that, the exchange plans to engage in what Stevens described as "deep consultation" with its stakeholders over the next four months in an effort to built a toolkit of "potential advancements" in settlement services enabled by distributed ledger technology. By March 2018, the exchange intends to present the full scope of the project as a result of this discussion, a more exact timeline and final launch plans to the public. Speaking at the press event, Steven said: "Updating a system like this is a big undertaking, it only happens once every 15 or 20 years so we need to make sure it’s future-proofed."

coindesk	book-review-digital-gold-is-an-invaluable-page-turner	Book Review: Digital Gold is an Invaluable Page-Turner	2015-05-24T15:23	Title: Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the inside story of the misfits and millionaires trying to reinvent money Author: Nathaniel Popper Publication date: 19th May 2015 Summary : Remember the headlines that first mentioned bitcoin, Mt. Gox, the Silk Road and Bitcoin Jesus ? Those were fleeting peaks on the events unfolding behind closed doors in the development of bitcoin. Digital Gold is your backstage pass to those events. It’s a compelling and extensive narrative that gives a reader a personal look at the heroes and villains of bitcoin’s brief history. Digital Gold presents the most extensive history of bitcoin thus far, making it an invaluable page-turner for bitcoin aficionados and newbies alike. It follows the ineptitude of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles (and his cat), the rise and demise of the Dread Pirate Roberts and bitcoin evangelists Roger Ver and Charlie Shrem. Digital Gold is a must read for anyone interested in understanding what many consider to be the greatest invention since the Internet. An accessible account In April 2013, New York Times technology and finance reporter Nathaniel Popper described the Winkelvoss twins as “the first prominent figures in the largely anonymous bitcoin world”. This was the first time Popper had covered bitcoin, but would not be the last. The bitcoin world is less anonymous today, but until Digital Gold, we’ve lacked an accessible account that traces today’s growing bitcoin industry back to the early days. Digital Gold is the perfect resource for the reader interested in the work that preceded bitcoin and the extent of its uses today. Bitcoin is constantly editorialized; while some write its obituary (again and again), others envision its revolutionary future. Nathaniel Popper approaches the scene as a curious observer who condenses the passionate voices of bitcoin visionaries and nemeses into a detailed narrative. He first began covering it when the Winklevoss twins started purchasing large quantities of bitcoin in 2013. Since then, he has maintained a remarkably objective tone in his reporting. His continued reporting on bitcoin through the past few years has helped bring bitcoin’s saga into mainstream media and equipped him with the experience to write this book, the first of its kind. The beginning of the adventure The adventure begins in old chat rooms, where cypherpunks pioneered public/private key cryptography, and picks up steam from there. It explores the first bitcoin transactions, the first bitcoin giveaways and the early stage discoveries, giving an intimate account of bitcoin’s protagonists that lets the reader watch over their shoulders. Following the characters from news headlines makes for a nervous first hand ride as we watch the rise of the Silk Road and Mt. Gox, with all the early problems that each faced. A great strength of the book is not just the extensiveness of the research, but the way in which it is fit together. It both maintains the intimacy of exploring bitcoin’s past with the main characters and weaves the different threads in and out of each other as the bitcoin community grows in size. One of these cases comes from bitcoin’s use in an Argentine black-market currency exchange (a teaser is available here ). Seeking to curb inflation, the Argentine government put in place currency exchange controls to stem the flow of dollars out of the country. They placed no such restrictions on bitcoin and so “bitcoin... was on display in Buenos Aires, at the first conference hosted by Bitcoin Argentina”. With conventional banking services, event organizer Diego [Gutierrez Zaldivar] would receive 595 pesos for a $100 ticket after a 20 day wait. However, using Argentine startup BitPagos, each $100 ticket yielded around 920 pesos. No longer a thing of speculative uses, bitcoin is now used by freelancers and businesses working with foreigners. These currency controls are response to a larger problem in Argentina; chronic inflation which regularly destroys family savings. This life experience is what stirs Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares to action and what draws Popper into leaning heavily on his perspective. A candidate for most interesting man in the world by Popper’s account, Casares acts as the first high profile bitcoin evangelist. He introduces many notable players to bitcoin, each of which will lead the reader to say ‘ah-ha’ out loud. Casares also argues for the widespread adoption of bitcoin as a digital asset (a perfected version of gold), making for a rather uncoincidental title of the book. He serves largely as the protagonist of Popper’s work and his involvement goes well beyond organizing the first Argentine Bitcoin Meetup and running what was for a time the best funded bitcoin startup. Around the world Popper uses Argentina to describe real uses in a unique political economy but also jumps around the world to Japan, China, and Tahoe to describe the many other niches of bitcoin’s development. In doing so, Popper never fails to include a bit of bemused comedy. He follows the rise and fall of the comically inept Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles (“He was two years into running the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, but had still not attended a single bitcoin event abroad – a fact that he blamed on the sickness of his cat, Tibane, who needed daily shots that Mark believed only he could administer”) and the rise (and fall) of Silk Road (the customer review of anonymous merchants fed a “feedback loop [that] created a remarkably engaged online community in which pot and heroin highs were discussed with the same level of analytical detail that Consumer Reports brought to its toaster reviews”). Popper briefly describes the spending habits of the new bitcoin elite, illuminating the seedy underbelly that turned many away from bitcoin. Not whitewashing the behavior of the some early adopters, Popper covers the rise and fall of BitInstant and Charlie Shrem (“bitcoin’s first felon”) as well. Popper uses this opportunity to show a transformation in much of the bitcoin community away from the early crypto anarchists who supported bitcoin for philosophical reasons, towards a growing desire from governments, individuals, and those looking to build bitcoin businesses for sensible regulation. Much to the relief of the reader, Popper never brings up tulips. While they were mentioned in his first article on bitcoin, Popper has avoided the temptation that traps so many. Bitcoin, he alludes, is here to stay. Eager anticipation Unraveling the story you already partially know, each page of Digital Gold is read with eager anticipation. It builds from unfamiliar territory before bitcoin was in the news and with each chapter it slowly tilts the focus from the past to the future. This pivot comes late in the book as Popper hurriedly tries to tie up loose ends while maintaining the objectivity that makes the rest of the book so excellent. It leaves the reader wanting more, sparking a curiosity about the many things that have happened since mid 2014. This abruptness is notable when Popper introduces M-Pesa (a mobile money) only fleetingly. Many bitcoiners excitedly prophesy that bitcoin will help bank the unbanked and supplant remittance services like Western Union. Popper mentions these cases and their supporting voices, but sheds no light on the use of bitcoin in the developing world. If many in the community are so convinced this is bitcoin’s killer application, why doesn’t Popper explore it further? A compelling alternative would be to introduce these ideas (among others) in an epilogue that looked towards the future of bitcoin and explained these use cases a bit more. While Popper undoubtedly wished to discover mysterious bitcoin forefather, Satoshi Nakamoto, Digital Gold makes clear that it doesn’t matter much who Satoshi really is. He/she/they might own a significant number of coins, but just as bitcoin mining and transaction confirmation is decentralized, so is the work and effort which has brought it along this far. Nakamoto set the ball in motion but Popper shows that the fate of bitcoin is now in the hands of investors and ideologues who continue to work on bitcoin and the infrastructure around it. Bitcoin is no longer driven by Silk Road purchases, unregistered gambling sites, and the passionate crypto anarchists who made it viable in the the early years. Today, bitcoin is slowly gaining respect with industry leaders and, reading between the lines, Digital Gold coyly hints what may be around the next corner.

coindesk	brisbane-airport-to-launch-in-terminal-cryptocurrency-payments	Brisbane Airport to Launch In-Terminal Cryptocurrency Payments - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T12:00	Australia's Brisbane Airport has announced it will roll out cryptocurrency payments within the terminal shopping areas. The new payment system, provided by cryptocurrency travel firm TravelbyBit, will enable travellers to use bitcoin, ethereum, dash and other digital currencies to shop and dine at various stores and restaurants across both of Brisbane's air terminals, a press release says. Roel Hellemons, Brisbane Airport Corporation's (BAC) general manager of strategic planning and development, said that the airport is the first worldwide to incorporate cryptocurrency payments. The move, he said, "makes sense" because many people who have invested in cryptocurrencies travel internationally. He continued: "This is just the beginning for us as we hope to expand the digital currency option across the business." According to TravelbyBit CEO Caleb Yeoh, the payment system presents a "genuine use case for cryptocurrencies" in the field of tourism. "Here at TravelbyBit we are promoting the bitcoin travel movement. Digital currency for world-wide travel. It’s simple, safe and there’s no bank fees," Yeoh added. The use of cryptocurrencies to boost tourism and related services is something that global politicians have increasingly being investigating. In November, the head of Russia’s Federal Agency for Tourism predicted that blockchain technology will transform the country's tourism industry. "We are absolutely convinced in our federal agency that blockchain will seriously change the tourism market, although, in our opinion, it will happen not in two years but in 5–10 years," said Oleg Safonov at the time. In the U.S., legislators in Hawaii have pushed for the creation of a working group dedicated to blockchain technology, with a focus on tourism payments.

coindesk	can-bitcoin-destroyed-7-unlikely-paths-irrelevance	Can Bitcoin Be Destroyed? 7 (Unlikely) Paths to Irrelevance - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T05:00	Sebastien Meunier is a financial services advisor with 15 years of experience in business innovation. He speaks on fintech and is a veteran startup mentor. Before we get into the speculation, let's start with the facts – bitcoin has been declared dead more than 200 times. Despite the fact that the world's first cryptocurrency has operated with near-100 percent uptime (for almost 10 years), it's still fashionable to predict its demise. Even supposedly smart people are known for propagating something I'll call "bitcoin derangement syndrome." They keep predicting bitcoin's demise even though they are daily proven wrong. But if we assume that these individuals possess a level of intelligence, the only explanation for the failed predictions and emotional arguments is that they never take the time to study and understand how the system works. In this way, I'd like to help by listing all the possible ways bitcoin could be destroyed. Technically speaking, bitcoin will live as long as a handful of computers run the bitcoin software on a network. Only one extreme scenario would lead to annihilation. It is likely then that it will still be the top cryptocurrency in the coming years, unless the community destroys itself due to greed or carelessness. Scenario 1: Armageddon Likelihood (next 5 years): Close to zero Impact: Sudden death If all sources of electricity, internet and data communications were shut down across the planet, bitcoin nodes would not be able to contact each other. The system would be useless. A temporary worldwide internet shutdown would certainly create confusion among the bitcoin community, but it's important to note that the system would (theoretically) just start again from the longest chain. Even if hardcore fans or museums continue to run its software forever, bitcoin will never technically be extinct. Scenario 2: Critical bug Likelihood (next 5 years): Low Potential impact: Sudden irrelevance In this scenario, a bitcoin update could contain a bug on the level of the infamous DAO project (built on the ethereum blockchain), one that puts the integrity of the system at risk. Even if the community agreed (which is not guaranteed) to fix the code, to install the new version and to restart the system, it would certainly lead to a crash of the price and a fork. The bitcoin community is aware of the risk: any modification to the code is peer-reviewed and tested, in accordance to the contribution guidelines. That being said, only the NASA is able to produce software code with zero defect. Scenario 3: Forked to irrelevance Likelihood (next 5 years): Low Potential impact: Slow irrelevance Bitcoin can be forked multiples times if the community disagrees on the path forward, for technical reasons (or "because money"). The Bitcoin Cash split, which occurred last summer, was not that harmful for bitcoin because it saw the network's nodes and hash power decline. Theoretically, several splits could happen in which this network was further fragmented and its power reduced. Should this occur, I believe bitcoin would lose its dominance, slowly sinking into irrelevance. Again, it is the interest of the community to not let this happen. Scenario 4: Joint government crackdown Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-low Potential impact: Sudden irrelevance Governments cannot destroy bitcoin itself because of its decentralized nature. However, they can control and restrict its use in their jurisdiction. For instance, they can have the bank accounts of crypto companies closed, and they can forbid the creation of any and all related businesses. If only a handful of countries ban cryptocurrencies, the impact will be limited because businesses will simply move to friendlier jurisdictions. This is exactly what happened after China banned its domestic order-book exchanges last year. And while the likelihood that one or more governments will go after bitcoin in the same way is almost assured, I think a global ban is almost impossible (imagine the United Nations reaching such a consensus). Besides, bitcoin is already legal in Japan. If the US, EU, UK and China jointly banned cryptocurrencies, that would be very damaging. However, it is more likely that they will regulate the cryptocurrency market to collect tax revenues while protecting individual investors. Scenario 5: Major hack Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-high Potential impact: Temporary crash This scenario could occur in a few different ways. In the first, called a 51 percent attack, a malicious network actor could attempt to hack the protocol itself. This is theoretically possible, but its likelihood is very low. From the inside, the 51 percent attackers would destroy their own source of profit. From the outside, it would require enormous investment in mining equipment and energy, and again the attacker’s source of profit would crash. More likely is a hack then on an application built on top of the protocol. When Mt. Gox was hacked back in 2014 (an example of this attack), it was handling 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions. Today, there are many more exchanges around the world. If one of them was hacked and a large amount of bitcoin stolen, the price would likely crash, but bitcoin would probably recover. Recently, for example, $400 million worth of NEM was stolen from the exchange Coincheck: the price of NEM only went down by 15 to 20 percent and recovered in one day. Scenario 6: "Better" cryptocurrency Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-low Potential impact: Slow irrelevance Is it possible for a "better" currency to replace bitcoin? (By "better," I mean more profitable to mine and with lower transaction costs for users, everything else being equal.) Let's face it: this is more about economics and less about convenience. That cryptocurrency would have to be much "better" to overcome the network effect and brand capital from which bitcoin benefits today. The fact that it has not happened yet is telling. Besides, for governance and economic reasons (not a technical problem), a "universal" UN-backed cryptocurrency isn't likely to happen within five years. There is another way economics could play out: if the price of electricity went up very significantly, mining could become unprofitable. Only large pools where electricity is relatively cheaper would remain. This is a tough cost-security trade-off. Bitcoin would have to find a way to lower the cost of security while maintaining the integrity of the ledger. Scenario 7: Market fatigue Likelihood (next 5 years): Low Potential impact: Slow irrelevance If crypto startups fail to deliver any tangible value in the real world, people could slowly start to lose faith in cryptocurrencies and tokens. (Something that arguably happened during the bear market of 2015 and 2016). In this case, the growth of the market could slow down and its value eventually stabilize. The crypto market would lose its attractiveness from an investment point of view, leading to further decline and so forth… Personally, I do believe that some crypto startups will eventually create value in the real world. In any case, the crypto market is still nascent and we still have time until it gets boring. As history has shown also, the market is always capable of bouncing back.

coindesk	can-blockchain-save-us-from-the-internets-original-sin	Can Blockchain Save Us from the Internet's Original Sin? - CoinDesk	2017-10-27T13:00	Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative. In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey looks at how blockchain might free society from the stranglehold of the four giant data hogs of the internet era: Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. What's wrong with this picture? The front page of The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday: "Amazon Lures 238 Bids for its Second Home." It's not a good thing that a single company can get the political leaders of so many American cities and states to scramble over each other to try to lure $5 billion in spending on some new buildings. The story shows that Amazon's influence over American urban life is far more than one company deserves: over tax policies, over city planning decisions, over the aesthetics and culture of our communities. Society's interests lie in sustaining a dynamic, innovative and evolving economy, not one in which hegemonic companies have oversized sway over everyone's decision-making. This is the core problem of centralization in the internet age – a pet topic for those of us who believe the ideas behind blockchain technology can point us toward a better economic model. Amazon is not alone, of course. But it's in a very select group. An acronym has emerged to define the small club of digital behemoths to which it belongs: GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple). Two other WSJ stories this past week bring home the distorting influence of two other members of that club. One was Christopher Mims' column about Facebook's "master algorithm," which in determining what we see and read is literally dictating how we think. The other was about Google winning the quantum computing race, a prize that will afford the winner unimaginable competitive advantages in data-processing capabilities. Meanwhile, with my iPhone 6's screen cracked and its functionality deteriorated since I upgraded to iOS 11, I'm tempted to switch to a Samsung phone, but don't want to lose all the data and connectivity that the Apple universe has locked me into. And I know that with the Android OS, I'd just be getting Google's version of the same dependency anyway. The internet's original sin How did the GAFA gang get to be so powerful? It comes down to an original sin in the first design of the internet. The inventors of packet switching and of the basic protocols on which the modern web is built did a masterful job figuring how to move information seamlessly across a distributed network. What they didn't do was resolve the problem of trust. Since information is power, it is often highly sensitive. So when people share it with each other, they need to know that data can be trusted. But since there was no truly decentralized trust mediation system in place in the 1990s – no permissionless way to solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem – an asymmetric solution was found. On the one hand, the distribution of public information was disintermediated, which put all centralized providers of that information, especially newspapers and other media outlets, under intense business pressure from blogs and other new information competitors. But on the other, all valuable information – particularly money itself, an especially valuable form of information – was still intermediated by trusted third parties. It was a centralized solution bolted onto a decentralized information infrastructure. So, we got website hosting services to manage each site's files. We got certificate authorities to authenticate reliable addresses. We got banks and credit card providers to run the payment system. And since we craved the network that Facebook's community offered and that Amazon's marketplace could reach and Google's search engine could tap, we fed ever more valuable information into the hands of these entities – those that won the early, defining battles to establish dominance of those services. A new internet version of the trusted third party was born, and it was just as powerful, if not more so, than those archetypal trusted third parties of the pre-internet era: banks. Only these newcomers' currency isn't dollars, it's data. A decentralized way forward Lately, problems such as Facebook's "fake news" dilemma and Equifax's cyberbreach have finally begun shining a light on the fundamental flaws of a centralized system for controlling sensitive information. But our economy was suffering long before that as result of this re-intermediation. Since producers now depend on Amazon to reach their customers, their entire business model – from production processes to their planning strategies – is determined by whatever information is generated by the Seattle company's algorithm. That's an inherent impediment to effective innovation and creates a dependency that limits competitive capabilities. If you think this level of domination is bad, consider what will happen when we arrive at a world in which artificial intelligence, machine learning and the Internet of Things have combined to ensure that virtually every decision we make is automated by some algorithm. The question "who owns the data?" is going to become a much bigger problem. I don't know if the blockchain will ultimately solve all this. In the blockchain space, there are unsolved challenges relating to how to scale permissionless blockchains such as bitcoin, as well as questions about how much autonomy people want or should have over their own money and their data. But surely the answer lies somewhere within the core concept of a decentralized trust mechanism that blockchain points to. Within the model that Satoshi Nakamoto's invention produced – a system for how to agree on the validity of information shared by strangers in an environment of mistrust – we have a new framework for thinking about who gets to manage data in the internet age. The idea that the global economy of the future will be one in which individuals and small businesses have direct control over their data, and yet can still operate in open markets and generate network effects is an exciting prospect. It's a future in which a more level playing field gives rise to true competition and unleashes the kind of open-source innovation that's needed to solve many of the problems we face. That world will eventually come. The places that win in that environment will be those that first embrace a new, decentralized model for data sharing and peer-to-peer trading that promotes true competition. The losers will likely include whichever city wins the 2017 beauty contest to host Amazon's new headquarters.

coindesk	canadian-bitcoin-exchange-hit-armed-robbers-police-say	Bitcoin Exchange Hit By Armed Robbers in Thwarted Theft - CoinDesk	2018-01-24T23:00	Ottawa police are seeking two suspects after an attempted armed robbery at a cryptocurrency exchange. Three people entered the offices of Canadian Bitcoins in Ottawa carrying handguns and restrained four employees on Tuesday morning, according to CBC News. At that point, they attempted to compel one of the employees to make an outbound transaction from the exchange. A fifth employee called police before any assets could be taken, police told the news service. One suspect has been arrested and charged, according to police. The charges include robbery with a firearm and forcible confinement. The names of the suspects were not released. CBC News reported in a Facebook post that the suspects were looking for physical cash, but other armed robberies have successfully made off with cryptocurrency wallets. The New York District Attorney's Office filed armed robbery and kidnapping charges against New Jersey native Louis Meza after he allegedly stole more than $1.8 million of ether last November. In the filing, the DA's office claimed Meza held his victim at gunpoint, forcing him to turn over a cell phone and private keys, which he used to access the victim's digital wallet.

coindesk	canadian-research-body-pilots-ethereum-in-transparency-push	Canadian Research Body Pilots Ethereum in Transparency Push - CoinDesk	2018-01-22T16:00	The National Research Council of Canada (NRC), a government initiative, is trialing the ethereum blockchain for recording government contracts. For the pilot, the NRC is using the Catena platform from blockchain startup Bitaccess for publishing information on government grants and contributions over the open-source blockchain. The effort is part of a move to make the government's administration boost transparency, according to a press release. The NRC's Industrial Research Assistance Program is the first entity to test the technology, and is already releasing contributions information. The group will also assess how the government can apply blockchain technology in other areas. Bitaccess co-founder Moe Adham said in a blog post that the company built its Catena Blockchain Suite to help organizations become familiar with using the technology. He explained: "Our goal is to enable institutions to become fully transparent, and enable constituents to participate in the verification and validation of public information." While notable, this is not the first official body in the country to foray into blockchain technology. The Canadian central bank has already begun experimenting with blockchain-based platforms, particularly with settlement systems, as previously reported by CoinDesk. The Bank of Canada's "Project Jasper," now in its third phase, has conducted research into securities settlements and resiliency under periods of stress.

coindesk	cdc-trial-blockchain-ibm-bid-manage-medical-data	CDC to Trial Blockchain With IBM in Bid to Manage Medical Data - CoinDesk	2017-10-26T05:00	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has signed an agreement with IBM Watson Health to research the use of blockchain for storing and exchanging medical data. According to a report by the Fast Company, Shahram Ebadollahi, IBM’s chief science officer revealed the partnership during an event hosted on Monday. Ebadollahi said that that the effort is an extension of the tech giant's existing research initiative with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Announced earlier this year, that initiative with the FDA is aimed at testing a blockchain-based platform through which electronic medical records, clinical trials, and health data gathered from wearable devices could be better shared. “This is, in essence, an extension of the work we’ve been doing this year with the FDA...exploring owner-mediated data exchange using blockchain," Ebadollahi remarked at the event. Indeed, the CDC is no stranger to the technology. Last month, as reported by CoinDesk, the CDC – which operates within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is chiefly responsible for preventing and responding to disease outbreaks – is looking at the tech as a way to capture critical information during crisis situations more effectively. HHS, too, is one of several U.S. government departments that is exploring the use of blockchain, particularly in the area of medical administration.

coindesk	central-bank-cryptocurrency-not-2018	A Central Bank Cryptocurrency? Not in 2018 - CoinDesk	2017-12-26T17:30	JP Koning is an avid blogger covering monetary economics and the history of money on his blog Moneyness. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review. Central banks may be the 800-pound gorillas of the financial universe, but they have largely kept their hands off of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, preferring to monitor developments from a distance. Will that change in 2018? Some have speculated that 2018 will be the year that central banks start to add bitcoins to their balance sheets. I don't think so. Here's why: Your average bitcoin buyer has dramatically different goals from your average central banker. Bitcoin buyers want to earn 10,000 percent returns and engage in near-anonymous transactions. Central bankers don't need high returns, nor do they require anonymity. They have an obligation to their citizens to ensure the stability of the currency. The steadiness of the assets that central banks hold in their portfolios is a key part of achieving this mandate. If the purchasing power of money begins to fall too fast relative to its target, central bankers will try to undo this by buying back sufficient amounts of currency. This requires selling assets from their portfolio, or open market sales. Assets that do not fluctuate much in value – say a government bond – can be counted on as steady material for open market sales. But bitcoin's price regularly fluctuates by 20-30 percent per week. Given this volatility, a central banker can’t expect to rely on bitcoin to provide oomph in future buyback efforts. This means bitcoins won't help central bankers achieve their price stability mandate, and I wouldn't expect any of them to begin including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their portfolios. Now, there may be a few central banks that add trace amounts of cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets – but only as a political stunt. For instance, I can imagine the Central Bank of Iran or the Central Bank of Russia publicly announcing that they'll reduce their U.S. dollar reserves by some small amount and substituting it with bitcoins. But this would only be a way to land a public relations blow against an enemy, and not as a way to promote sound central banking. Central bank digital currency Many central bankers have been exploring the idea of issuing central bank digital currencies or digital accounts for use by regular folks. These tokens could be issued on a blockchain, held in a regular account, or exist on a smart card. Unlike bitcoin, this form of money would be fixed in value – i.e. one unit of digital currency would be pegged at $1 banknote. I think it is unlikely that any central bank digital currencies or accounts will be introduced in 2018. There is a good chance that many central banks will even backpedal their efforts as they learn more about the challenges involved in introducing a digital payments product. Here is the crux of the problem: It only makes sense for a central bank to issue digital currency or publicly-available accounts if there is sufficient demand. But it is not apparent where this demand will come from given that private bank accounts already provide the public with the same set of services that a central bank product would hypothetically offer. For instance, one stated advantage of a central bank digital currency is that citizens would get the ability to hold risk-free digital money. But since bank deposits are themselves guaranteed by state-run insurance deposit schemes up to very high amounts, they are already 100 percent safe. So there is no apparent reason for anyone to switch. Nor will central banks find it easy to compete with already-existing private sector payments alternatives. Would the People's Bank of China (PBOC) do a better job running a retail payments network than Alibaba or Tencent? Would the Bank of Canada provide a superior payments product than Canada's commercial banks, say TD or CIBC, which bundle all sorts of other financial services along with their payments offering? Probably not. So, it is not apparent to me why the public would want to use the central bank's product – and thus no reason for central bankers to spend much time on these projects. A central bank digital currency could only gain public acceptance by providing a unique service that private alternatives do not offer: anonymity. We already know people use physical cash because – among other reasons – it enhances privacy. Likewise, anonymity would drive adoption of a digital version of cash. But, this would force central bankers out of their comfort zone and into what would be a contentious public debate over anonymity and financial censorship. The upshot is that the only digital currency projects that stand a chance of surviving against the private competition must include anonymity, but only determined central bankers who understand the value of anonymity as a public service will be able to drive these anonymous digital currency projects forward in the face of criticism. Unfortunately, there probably aren't too many central bankers out there willing to take that risk. Regulation Still, with central banks hesitant to buy cryptocurrencies or adopt CBDC, the one front on which they will be active in 2018 is regulation. As cryptocurrencies become ever more embedded into the conventional financial sector – say through futures, ETFs, hedge funds, or credit to buy bitcoin – the perceived risks of instability spreading from cryptocurrency markets into conventional markets increase. Central bankers have stood by through most of the rise of cryptocurrencies. But since they have a watchdog role to play, I would expect them to increasingly view it as their responsibility to step in and regulate the sector. It remains to be seen what form this regulation takes. See 2018 differently? CoinDesk is now accepting submissions to its 2017 in Review. Email news@coindesk.com to make your voice heard.

coindesk	cftc-files-suits-against-crypto-investment-schemes-for-alleged-fraud	CFTC Files Suits Against Crypto Investment Schemes for Alleged Fraud - CoinDesk	2018-01-19T14:09	The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) brought two lawsuits against allegedly fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes yesterday. The cases, both filed in the U.S. federal court in the New York Eastern District, are the latest move from the country's derivatives regulator in bringing closer scrutiny over activities involving cryptocurrencies, which the agency regulates as commodities. The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission published a joint statement on the lawsuits, attributed to SEC Co-Enforcement Directors Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin and CFTC Enforcement Director James McDonald, who noted: "When market participants engage in fraud under the guise of offering digital instruments – whether characterized as virtual currencies, coins, tokens, or the like – the SEC and the CFTC will look beyond form, examine the substance of the activity and prosecute violations of the federal securities and commodities laws. The Divisions of Enforcement for the SEC and CFTC will continue to address violations and bring actions to stop and prevent fraud in the offer and sale of digital instruments." In one case, the CFTC alleged that Dillon Michael Dean from Colorado and his company, Entrepreneurs Headquarters Limited, collected more than $1.1 million in bitcoin from over 600 people as part of a pooled investment vehicle for trading commodity interests. The pool was said to invest in binary options contracts, according to the complaint. However, the CFTC alleged that the defendants misappropriated the funds. In the second case, Patrick Kerry McDonnell from New York and the company CabbageTech, are being sued by the CFTC for allegedly absconding with customers' digital assets. According to the complaint, the agency alleged that McDonnell branded himself as a cryptocurrency investment expert with trading advice that could result in highly attractive returns on investment. For example, the complaint said that, in one case, McDonnell allegedly claimed a return of 300 percent with his trading tips. Subsequently the regulator alleged that soon after customers sent in money and cryptocurrencies for his advisory services, the defendant cut off communications with customers and "simply misappropriated" the funds. In both cases, according to the complaints, the CFTC said neither of the two defendants and their companies had previously registered with the agency. And to a report from Reuters, a third CFTC case is still under seal. These cases aren't the first time the agency has acted on alleged wrongdoings involving cryptocurrencies. Last year, the regulator also brought a suit against another man for an alleged bitcoin Ponzi scheme. In addition, the CFTC also indicated last year that, in the future, tokens issued through initial coin offerings may also be treated as commodities. The filings for the two cases can be found below: CFTC vs Dillon Michael Dean by CoinDesk on Scribd r CFTC vs Patrick K.

coindesk	china-blockchain-maybe-2018	China on a Blockchain? Maybe in 2018 - CoinDesk	2017-12-30T23:20	Chun Yin Cheung is a partner in PwC China's risk assurance practice, based in the Shanghai office, and a committee member of VeChain Foundation. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review, and represents the author's personal view, not necessarily the opinions of his employer. In 2018, I forecast China will surprise the world (again) and change the crypto world. I personally believe in 2018 China will be the first major country to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), and that we will also see a large-scale blockchain implementation in the retail and logistic industry with a blockchain solution developed by Chinese companies. Now, I'll unpack my predictions. A Chinese CBDC Although cryptocurrency exchanges were banned from China in September this year, the country has always taken a positive attitude toward central bank digital currency and blockchain, actively carrying out relevant research. In Feb. 2016, for example, People's Bank of China (PBOC) president Mr. Zhou Xiaochun admitted during an interview that the Chinese government has been investigating the adoption of CBDC for a long time. On Dec. 27 of that year, blockchain was written into the "13th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization." The government affirmed the value of blockchain, and it has since risen to the level of our national science and technology strategy. Technically, China is ready to launch the first CBDC, as the PBOC has set up a dedicated digital currency research group in 2014 to study both digital currency issuance and the business operation framework that would need to support the launch of such technology. In January 2017, China's central bank successfully tested the digital notes exchange platform. According to a paper published in Tsinghua Financial Review, a digital currency was used to exchange notes between commercial banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, WeBank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Bank of Hangzhou. In July, the Central Bank Digital Currency Research Institution officially began operating as a separate business unit within PBOC. A strategic play Strategically, the launch of the Chinese CBDC is in line with the Belt and Road Initiative, an integrated upgrade of China's international cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union, China-Japan-South Korea Free Trade Area and other areas. It enables China to exert its geopolitical advantages, and is an important platform for cooperation. Transactions with digital currency are more efficient and convenient, eliminating the third-party reconciliation and the automated implementation reducing payment costs and error rates. It increases the chances other countries would pay with RMB in transactions, which increases the liquidity and internationalizes the RMB. From risk management perspective, the Chinese CBDC may first be launched through a pilot program to manage the risk and public expectation. A Chinese CBDC may first be limited to banks for intra-bank transactions so that existing foreign exchange and capital controls can still be imposed without radical changes. It also avoids the worry that RMB paper notes or metal coins will be abolished (like what India did) and lead to financial instability. The general public and commercial world also needs more time to understand the technology and develop the associated applications. Business progress I also expect we will see some high-profile adoptions of blockchain technology in retail and logistic companies. Startups like VeChain launched the first commercial blockchain platform through which a Chinese state-owned enterprise is now tracking and managing red wine imported from overseas. Customers can use their mobile phones to scan the IoT tags attached to the wine bottles to access to information shared by manufacturers, logistic companies and distributors through blockchain. We will also see global luxury brands, automobiles and wine manufacturers use blockchain and IoT technologies developed in China to tackle counterfeiting and introduce completely new experiences to customers. I am also aware that a major Chinese Internet company established a blockchain laboratory last year. In 2018, they plan to launch a blockchain platform to integrate their B2C, B2B, logistic and financial business units so as to share data with their suppliers and business partners. Don't see China taking center stage? CoinDesk is accepting submissions for our annual 2017 in Review. Emails news@coindesk.com to share your thoughts.

coindesk	china-moves-to-crack-down-on-digital-currency-pyramid-schemes	China Moves to Crack Down on Digital Currency Pyramid Schemes - CoinDesk	2018-01-22T17:00	China's public security ministry said on Friday that it will take aim at pyramid schemes in the country, including those that purportedly involve cryptocurrencies. In a Jan. 19 statement, the Ministry of Public Security disclosed its plan to crack down on pyramid scams, or financial schemes in which participants are encouraged to sell some kind of product while also soliciting others to create sales networks of their own. Some of the more well-known digital currency pyramid schemes include OneCoin, which as reported last week is the target of an international, multi-agency crackdown. The ministry said in a translated statement: "The public security organs and industrial and commercial departments of the country will continue to carry out special rectification in key areas and...concentrate on destroying the pyramid selling organizational system, severely punishing the members of the pyramid selling field, annihilate and destroy the network pyramid selling and criminal activities, [and] earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the general public as well as the economic and financial order." The statement doesn't make clear to what degree it will focus on schemes that claim to involve a cryptocurrency, versus pyramid schemes involving other types of products. That said, the mention signals that officials will apply scrutiny to some of the schemes involved. In the past, scams such as Gemcoin have resulted in thousands of Chinese citizens being defrauded, and OneCoin has been known to have a presence in China as well. It also remains to be seen whether China will move toward more forceful edicts, as shown in the case of the ICO ban last year. As reported by CoinDesk at the time, officials in China banned the blockchain funding model, deeming it to be an illegal form of fundraising.

coindesk	chinas-banking-regulator-pushes-blockchain-adoption-credit-market	China's Banking Regulator Pushes Blockchain Adoption for Credit Market - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T10:30	Blockchain technology should be adopted as part of a plan to boost development of China's secondary loan market, according to a paper by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC). Published on Jan. 19, the paper, drafted by a special committee, covers a variety of topics around developing and regulating financial technologies. In a section on the future development of China's credit market, it suggests the country should double down its adoption of blockchain technology. The CBRC, a major financial regulator in China under the State Council, writes in the paper: "As the time goes on, blockchain technology will enhance the efficiency of sharing critical data such as balance sheets and foster a more liquid secondary loan market. Integrating this technology to our financial service platforms should be part of the future strategy." According to the paper, the new comments are the result of recent research and the committee's visit to counterparts in the U.K and France last year. As reported by CoinDesk, several European banks have already been taking part in initiatives that use a distributed ledger platform to issue syndicated loans. The comments also come as another example of Chinese authorities taking different stances on cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. While speaking in favor of blockchain's potential in fostering the loan market, CBRC is also one of the seven Chinese state agencies that jointly issued the notable ban on initial coin offering activities in September of 2017. Elsewhere in the paper, while airing concerns that regulatory moves in China still largely fall behind the development of emerging internet technologies, the CBRC considers blockchain's smart-contract feature as a possible solution for automating compliance reports.

coindesk	chinese-finance-association-cautions-on-overseas-icos-and-crypto-trading	Chinese Finance Association Cautions on Overseas ICOs - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T11:00	A self-regulatory association in China is warning citizens against participating in overseas initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading. In a public statement published on Jan 26, the National Internet Finance Association (NIFA) writes that, after China issued a ban on ICOs last September and ordered closure of cryptocurrency exchanges, it has seen investors moving their funds to overseas platforms. NIFA states: "Recently, as worldwide governments are tightening regulations on cryptocurrencies, some overseas ICO and trading platforms may also face the risk of being forcefully closed due to compliance issue. Therefore, domestic investors are advised to be cautious of the risk." Although a self-regulatory organization and not a regulatory authority, NIFA was first initiated in 2015 by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and approved by the State Council. The warning comes just weeks after the association sent out another warning on activities that offer the substance of ICOs, but marketed in different forms. In addition, NIFA highlighted that existing over-the-counter (OTC) trading activities in China are not complying with current regulation. Some domestic social networks have served as a marketplace to facilitate peer-to-peer trading and some non-banking payment tools are also offering services to support the finance, the association states. As reported, following the closure of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, Chinese investors have largely moved to OTC platforms that operate over messaging applications such as WeChat and Telegram. Payment methods such as WeChat Pay, AliPay and bank transfers are still available for OTC traders to push through transactions. Citing details from central bank's ban on ICOs, the association pointed out that all these activities still fall within the scope of cryptocurrency trading, which may be subject to regulatory oversight. "Investors should be aware that these trading services all have potential risks on the policy front, and be advised to stay away from these illegal financing activities," NIFA writes. Just last week, the PBoC's Beijing branch reportedly issued a notice to local payment services requiring them to investigate and stop serving cryptocurrency traders in the country.

coindesk	cisco-details-internet-of-things-blockchain-system-in-patent-application	Cisco Seeks to Protect Blockchain System for IoT Device Tracking - CoinDesk	2017-10-20T09:00	Tech conglomerate Cisco Systems has proposed a blockchain system to track Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, the technology giant outlined a blockchain platform that can identify different connected devices, monitor their activity and evaluate how trustworthy the device is when connected to a network. The system is also said to be able to automatically register and assess new devices as they are added to the network, by comparing their performance to devices already on the blockchain. The filing specifically refers to "low-power and lossy networks" (LLNs), which usually run smart grid-type systems and may be composed of sensors, according to the release. Due to their environments and general design, these devices may suffer from reliability issues. LLNs may be composed of anywhere "from a few dozen and up to thousands or even millions of LLN routers," it explains. The number of LLNs is growing as well, as previously non-networked sensors and devices become increasingly connected to the internet. As a result, the proposed system aims to improve the process by which devices are monitored, something the concept's authors say is "key" for the Internet of Things: "Particularly in the context of the IoT and similar networks, device identity and management is a key building block for a viable end-to-end solution. Depending on the particular use case, a 'thing' may have to register or authenticate its identity with different service enablers that may use various service-specific procedures." Automating the system using a blockchain is just one of Cisco's proposed solutions for efficiently adding devices to different networks. Back in April, Cisco was one of several companies to announce an IoT protocol that registers devices using a blockchain-compatible application program interface, or API.

coindesk	closing-cryptocurrency-exchanges-was-the-right-move-says-pboc-official	Closing China's Bitcoin Exchanges Was the Right Move, Says PBoC Official - CoinDesk	2017-12-04T13:00	The vice governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, has said that the country's regulators took the right decision in cracking down on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. Speaking at a financial book award event in Shanghai at the weekend, the central bank executive said it was "scary to think about" the scenario if the regulators had not stopped cryptocurrency exchanges from serving the local market, Yicai Global reports. Gongsheng said: "If we didn't shut bitcoin exchanges and crack down on initial coin offerings [ICOs] a few months ago, and if more than 80 percent of the world's bitcoin transactions and financing activities were still taking place China, which was the case back in January, what would it be like today?" He continued to say that bitcoin speculation has caused financial market trouble, and that bitcoin is a bubble waiting to burst, like "tulip mania" in the 1600s and the dot-com crash. Reportedly quoting from a book by Kedge Business School professor Eric Pichet, Gongsheng further said, "So there's only one thing we can do – watch it from the bank of a river. One day you’ll see bitcoin's dead body float away in front of you." The official's comments echo those of Sheng Songcheng, an advisor to the central bank, who said in October that he supported the recent government crackdown on domestic ICOs. "I fully agree with the move to ban ICOs in China, and the calls for refunds to be made to investors. In my opinion, these actions are largely aimed at averting risk and protecting investors’ interests while also being an opportunity to further regulate trading of virtual currencies," Songcheng said at the time China outlawed ICOs in early September, and in the following weeks the country's cryptocurrency exchanges also said they would shut down due to regulatory pressure.

coindesk	coinbase-ordered-to-hand-irs-data-on-over-14000-users	Coinbase Ordered to Hand IRS Data on 14,000 Users - CoinDesk	2017-11-30T16:15	Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been ordered to disclose details of more than 14,000 customers to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Following a lengthy legal battle between the two entities, the San-Francisco district court ruled Tuesday that Coinbase must hand over user accounts at the exchange that bought, sold, sent or received sums of $20,000 and higher between 2013 and 2015. Coinbase must now provide the tax agency with the name, address, taxpayer identification numbers and date of birth of customers associated with these accounts, a court filing states. The dispute over user records has been ongoing since November 2016, with the IRS proposing a reduced summons in July this year – down from an initial 480,000 customer accounts requested. Back in July, Coinbase argued that the scope of the reduced summons remained too wide, labelling it a "fishing expedition." As a result, some of the data required has also been reduced from the initial order, which included information such as wallet addresses and public keys. In a blog post on the ruling, Coinbase claimed a "partial victory" in having this scope reduced. Legal research and advocacy group Coin Centre has spoken out against the ruling, saying it is "deeply unsatisfied with the lack of justification provided by the IRS" and that the case "sets a bad precedent for financial privacy." As previously detailed by CoinDesk, the investigation in concerned with locating cases of tax avoidance on transactions involving cryptocurrencies. In the blog post, Coinbase stated it is in the process of reviewing the order, and assured users: "In the event that we ultimately produce the documents under this Court order, we intend to notify impacted users in advance of any disclosure."

coindesk	coinbase-reminds-users-to-pay-their-bitcoin-taxes	Coinbase to Customers: Don't Forget to Pay Taxes on Bitcoin Gains - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T14:25	Exchange and wallet service provider Coinbase appears to be taking early steps to remind customers about their upcoming tax obligations. With the U.S. tax year having ended on Dec. 31, the company's users are now faced with a banner placed at the top of their dashboard, stating "Please remember to pay your taxes," and linking to the website's newly updated tax FAQ page. The FAQ points out that Coinbase "cannot provide legal or tax advice," but links to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines on how to report and pay taxes relating to crypto trading. A similar banner is also now visible for users in the EU as well. It also adds that users can refer to their account transaction histories in order to calculate their gains and losses. Coinbase further offers a Cost Basis for Taxes report (currently in beta) to assist with the process, the FAQ states. Notably, the move to raise awareness of users' tax liabilities comes soon after Coinbase concluded a lengthy court battle with the IRS over the tax agency's request that the firm hand over records on thousands of customers. The San-Francisco district court ruled in late November that Coinbase must hand over user accounts at the exchange that bought, sold, sent or received sums of $20,000 and higher between 2013 and 2015. The dispute over user records had been ongoing since November 2016, when the IRS had originally requested 480,000 customer accounts – a number that was slashed to over 14,000 in the final ruling, prompting Coinbase to claim the case a " partial victory."

The integration allows those using TT's platform to access spot bitcoin trading alongside futures for the cryptocurrency, the two firms announced Thursday. Trading Technologies CEO Rick Lane also announced efforts to develop "asset-class-specific functionality on the TT platform for cryptocurrency trading". Lane attributed the decision to partner with Coinbase to demand from the institutional trading community. Customers will have access to market data, charts and automated trading tools with which to submit orders and trade cryptocurrencies on GDAX. It will also enable spread trades, in which two assets are bought and sold concurrently. GDAX General Manager Adam White commented: "The offering is timed perfectly, just as futures on Bitcoin are taking form. TT provides one of the most powerful and ubiquitous tools to today’s futures trader. This, paired with GDAX’s crypto-spot market liquidity, will provide thousands of institutional investors a seamless and secure way to trade digital assets" Trading Technologies boasts access to 45 markets worldwide including Deutsche Boerse, Intercontinental Exchange and Nasdaq, as well as CME group and Cboe Global Markets Inc., which both started bitcoin futures trading late last year.

coindesk	coincheck-confirms-crypto-hack-loss-larger-than-mt-gox	Coincheck Confirms Crypto Hack Loss Larger than Mt Gox - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T16:10	Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has confirmed that it has suffered what appears to be the biggest hack in the history of the technology. In a press conference at 23:30 JST (14:30 UST), the exchange's president Wakata Koichi Yoshihiro and chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka estimated its loss at 58 billion yen (approx. $533 million). According to Bloomberg, which attended the conference, 500 million NEM tokens were taken from Coincheck's digital wallets. Tweets by Nikkei appeared to indicate that the precise amount stolen may not be fully known until further checks have been carried out into the intrusion. But though the exact dollar figure for the incident is hard to pin down (given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and the company's lack of information), data suggests the figure is now at least over $400 million, factoring for a decline in the value of XEM, the NEM protocol's token, following the incident. At press time, the price of XEM was $0.85, down from a high of $1.01 today, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Notably, the dollar amount stolen from Coincheck is likely greater than the amount stolen from Mt. Gox in 2014 (pegged at $340 million), though the impact on the cryptocurrency market will be much smaller given the immense increases in market capitalization since. Rumors had been circulating about the theft since early this morning when Coincheck abruptly froze most of its services. The firm announced on its website around 13:00 JST (04:00 UTC) that it had restricted deposits, trading and withdrawal of XEM, the token running on the NEM blockchain. A wider suspension on withdrawals of all cryptocurrencies as well as Japanese yen was announced around 30 minutes later. In the following hour, trading of all cryptocurrencies was also restricted, except bitcoin. According to the latest update, other deposit methods including credit cards have also been stopped. Coincheck is looking into compensating its customers, its executives also announced. It was also revealed that Coincheck was not registered with Japan's Financial Services Agency, but now plans to do so. Coincheck's president said he "deeply regretted" the issue. CoinDesk is following this developing story.

coindesk	coincheck-must-report-on-security-failures-says-finance-watchdog	Coincheck Must Report on Security Failures, Says Finance Watchdog - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T11:00	Following the recent major hack of Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, the country's financial watchdog is taking measures to ensure and improve the industry's security. The intrusion, which was revealed Friday after the exchange had abruptly ceased most services, saw the theft of about 500 million XEM – the token of the NEM network – worth roughly $420 million at the time. According to the latest update from Coincheck, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) has ordered the exchange to launch an investigation into its security vulnerabilities that led to the hack, and to submit a report for management improvement to the authority by Feb. 13. The FSA said the firm is also required to report details regarding the facts and causes of the issue. According to a report from Nikkei today, the authority announced the order during a press conference, saying, "Inappropriate management of system risks had become the norm at Coincheck." That sloppiness led to a loss even larger than that stolen in the notable Mt. Gox hack. Nikkei also indicated that the agency is expanding its investigations, including on-site inspections at other cryptocurrency exchanges in the country to prevent a reoccurrence of the issue. In an earlier statement issued to CoinDesk, the NEM.io Foundation also suggested a lack of security precautions at Coincheck may have resulted in the hack. "We would advise all exchanges to make use of our multi-signature smart contract which is among the best in the landscape. Coincheck didn't use them and that's why they could have been hacked. They were very relaxed with their security measure." said Lon Wong, president of the foundation. Over the weekend, Coincheck also issued a statement stating that the exchange will compensate the exchange's 260,000 NEM holders who lost funds, although no detailed plan for repayment has yet been released.

coindesk	coinhive-cryptocurrency-miner-is-6th-most-common-malware-says-report	CoinHive Cryptocurrency Miner Is 6th Most Common Malware, Says Report - CoinDesk	2017-11-14T12:00	Cyber-security solutions provider Check Point Software has said that the threat from cryptocurrency mining malware is rapidly growing. According to the company's latest Global Threat Impact Index report, the CoinHive variant became the sixth most-used malware in October. CoinHive – a JavaScript program that lurks unseen on websites – works by tapping the processing power of visitors' computers to mine monero. Maya Horowitz, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point, said in a press release that the emergence of mining malware like CoinHive highlights the "need for advanced threat prevention technologies" to curb such practices and protect networks from cyber-criminals. Horowitz added: "Crypto mining is a new, silent, yet significant actor in the threat landscape, allowing threat actors to make significant revenues while victims' endpoints and networks suffer from latency and decreased performance." According to the report, malware variant RoughTed (adware) topped the index, followed by Locky (ransomware) and Seamless (traffic redirection). Recently, internet domain provider Cloudflare suspended websites that ran hidden cryptocurrency miners, including that of the operator of torrent site ProxyBunker. This site was said to be running the Coinhive miner for four days prior to the suspension.

coindesk	colorado-new-bill-encourages-state-to-adopt-blockchain-for-data-security	New Bill in Colorado Encourages State to Adopt Blockchain for Data Security - CoinDesk	2018-01-18T07:19	A new state bill introduced to the Colorado Senate is looking at using blockchain technology to secure private data from cyberattacks. Introduced on Jan. 16, Senate Bill 086 suggests that using a distributed ledger would eliminate the need for paper records and in-person updating of such data. The blockchain system would subsequently solve the state's existing data collection and retention issues, and create a more secure record. If passed, the bill would direct Colorado's chief information security officer to evaluate the costs and benefits of using distributed ledgers in various government systems, and to determine blockchain's capability in handling cyberattacks compared to traditional computer systems. In 2017, according to the bill, there were somewhere between six and eight million attempted breaches of the Colorado state government's digital platforms per day. Many of the records kept by the government are unsecured, and therefore are "valuable targets for identity thieves and hackers with the intent to steal or penetrate corporate records." The bill went on to note that there is an increasing number of threats to steal personal information. In addition, the bill pointed out that Colorado currently still requires citizens to visit state agencies in person to modify their information, a pain-point that can be solved by a blockchain system. The bill went on: "Blockchain distributed ledgers provide the capability of openly traceable transactions while maintaining the privacy of each person performing the transactions."

coindesk	consensus-2017-people-and-machine-problems-solved-with-blockchain	Consensus 2017: People and Machine Problems – Solved with Blockchain? - CoinDesk	2017-05-23T11:00	On a global scale, blockchain solutions are being sought to tackle the word's most pressing problems, everything from identity to financial services for the unbanked, and even world hunger. But on panels discussing those very issues at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference, it became clear that these were complex problems that would take a long time to sort out. Several panelists put out a call for more data – not simply on blockchain solutions that are working, but those that aren't, too. Surprisingly, obtaining the latter was more difficult. "This is a nascent field, and the startups in the space are tight-lipped about failures," said Mike Pisa, policy fellow at Center for Global Development, a US think tank focused on international development. Rose Chan, founder of World Bank's blockchain working group, agreed with his sentiment, telling the audience: "We need more data, we need more pilots and more trials. It is better for the entire ecosystem to be honest about what is not working." And, as some pointed out, even blockchain has its limitations. As Niall McCann, lead electoral advisor at United Nations Development Programme, remarked, there are good reasons why some programs do not succeed. "We are operating in countries where having enough electricity in a mountain village is challenging," he said. "Often, we are dealing with problems that cannot be solved by technology." Formulating identity Speaking of global problems, worldwide, some 2.4 billion people do not have a formal identity, keeping them from becoming part of the global economy. But even for those who do have formal identities, the current centralized systems that manage those identities are cumbersome at best. For example, most of us have fragmented identities spread out across numerous apps, like Facebook or LinkedIn, or connected to physical documents, like passports and birth certificates. Reputations systems are equally split up. The hope is that blockchain could be a way to tie all of that together. "The vision here is that the user gets to create their own identity core," explained Ryan Shea, co-founder of Blockstack, a company focused on building a decentralized internet. "And then instead of Uber locking up their ratings about you in their system, it gets attached to your identity core." That all sounds well and good, but for many, putting personal information on a blockchain may sound daunting. Drummond Reed, chief trust officer of Evernym, a company building an identity network on a permissioned ledger, argued that people’s fears about privacy are unwarranted, saying: "You do not put private data on the chain. You put public data on the chain." Machines and money Identity doesn't just extend to humans, but also devices. On a different panel, several experts came together to discuss the future of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). Interestingly, the discussion quickly veered into how to tokenize money, so that machines can not only communicate and interact, but also transact. Julio Faura, head of R&D Santander pointed out that with tokens, it is possible to place value much closer to IoT devices. He said: "We are working on ways to represent fiat values as tokens. You send money to a bank account, and blockchain will issue a token. You segregate funds for the clients, machines, devices, whatever you want. Those tokens are not subject to market volatility, they are just recourse against fiat value." When asked if he thought that Santander would put a fiat-backed token on the blockchain, Faura responded: "Yes, we are working on that." "Of course it is easier to work with private implementations," he continued. "[L]ater on we can progress to larger permissioned blockchain, where you have many other corporate users. But we have to go one step at a time." Dominik Schiener, co-founder of IOTA, a non-profit organization working on a distributed ledger technology for IoT, said: "The way we see banks, is like on- and off-ramping for the fiat tokens." But others on the panel were cautious about moving too fast in that direction. Allison Clift Jennings, CEO and co-founder of Filament, a decentralized IoT solution that enables devices to hold unique identities on a public ledger, explained that her company's typical customer is a Fortune 1000 company. "Tokenization is a little strange for them in a IoT of situations," she said, suggesting that there needs to be a hybrid approach to arrive at viable solutions. Jennings told the crowd: "We need to help guide them – hold their hand, really – as they get comfortable with this brave new world."

coindesk	contortions-compliance-life-new-yorks-bitlicense	Contortions for Compliance: Life Under New York's BitLicense - CoinDesk	2018-01-21T12:40	Sarah H. Brennan, a corporate and securities attorney, leads the blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and digital assets practice team at Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman LLP. In June 2015, in a race to be a first mover in the space, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) enacted the BitLicense regulatory framework, a licensing regime that covers substantially all "virtual currency business activity" to the extent it touches New York or its residents. Namely, any business engaging in virtual currency business activity involving New York State or persons that reside, are located, have a place of business, or are conducting business in New York must apply for the BitLicense, with no grace periods or de minimis exceptions. To the extent a business makes it through the licensing process and receives a BitLicense, as a whopping four businesses have to date (in addition to two companies who undertook the application process and received trust charters ), the BitLicense imposes significant operational burdens, requiring robust compliance policies and processes with respect to anti-fraud, anti-money-laundering, cybersecurity, privacy and information security, among other requirements. As such, the BitLicense has prompted flight from New York by larger players such as Bitfinex and Shapeshift and has had a chilling effect on others acting in an abundance of caution. For those of us who remain in New York because we happen to live here, there is a widespread sense of confusion as to the scope of activities which fall under the purview of the regulations given: their vague wording, requirements that seem positioned toward financial institutions and the lack of formal guidance in the wake of the enactment of the regulations. In all, uncertainty as to the reach of the licensing requirement has left many companies with three options: avoid doing business in New York entirely, attempt to structure a business around the law, or engage in potential or outright non-compliance with the law. Based on the fact that DFS has received so few applicants to date, and has only five rejected applications on file, one could infer that many are electing non-compliance. Case studies Drone Energy and Travel by Token are two Empire State-based clients of mine running very different businesses, but with the common concern of operating in line with best practices. These businesses, in addition to complying with applicable foreign, federal and state regulatory regimes (existing and as they develop), are expending a significant amount of time and energy to structure around the BitLicense. For example, Drone Energy has a patented solution and an innovative business model designed around mining cryptocurrency. While it would be helpful for this exemption to have been explicit in the text of the BitLicense regulations, DFS has indicated in public comments that mining activities are categorically outside the scope of the law. However, the business will at some point look to exit to U.S. dollars without tripping into the definition of "virtual currency business activities." This has been limiting as we have discussed various potential business models but something our client is able and willing to work around. The other client, Travel by Token ( TBT ), is an early-stage start-up that uses an AirBnB/timeshare hybrid model for vacation stays, providing token holders access to vacation properties purchased and held by the company for the exclusive use of token holders at below-market prices. As the token is in the development stage, we are in the clear to develop the underlying software in New York State under the BitLicense regulations. But the company will need to leave the state before commencing a token offering and hazarding being deemed to be "controlling, administering, [and/]or issuing a Virtual Currency" under Section 200.2(q)(5) of the BitLicense regulations. While providing a viable path forward, structuring business plans and transactions to avoid the BitLicense is not a small or inexpensive undertaking. For an example of how regulations interact, given the developments in securities laws over the course of December alone, in order to conduct a utility token offering (whether for Travel by Token or for another New York State-based client) we are considering the following as a potential workaround to the BitLicense as it interacts with applicable securities laws: Structuring an initial offering as a 506(c) -compliant Simple Agreement for Future Tokens ( SAFT ) offering, using a third-party service provider to verify accredited investors and for AML/KYC compliance, to the extent we do initial raises in New York because the SAFT, while squarely an investment contract subject to securities laws, should not trip the BitLicense as no tokens are issued; Use funds raised in SAFT offering to continue to develop the token and move the business out-of-state and/or build out the organizational structure and form an affiliate to conduct the offering in a friendlier jurisdiction; Subsequent to reorganizing the business, in the next iteration of funding, through a token offering: At the time of the token offering, we would evaluate the state of securities laws with respect to whether utility tokens that are immediately usable in exchange for a service or product constitute securities in the eyes of the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state regulators. This would inform us as to whether there is a need to comply with securities laws in the larger offering. However, even if we take the position that a token is not a security based on the Howey test, we would likely expend the effort to produce offering materials with robust securities law type disclosures; We would, absent DFS guidance, plan to block New York State residents (and any others in jurisdictions that give rise to compliance concerns) from participating because, taking a conservative approach, all issuers will likely need a BitLicense to conduct any sort of token offering if based in the state or offering to state residents. The above process only relates to fundraising and is based on the current state of the law as we understand it (literally) today. New York passed the BitLicense regulations in a regulatory vacuum and now state and federal laws are catching up to it, oftentimes with less-than-stellar coordination between regulators, causing a compliance nightmare. Next steps Absent a successful challenge to the BitLicense regulations in court, and short of the DFS (or the state legislature) reworking the rules in line with the Uniform Law Commission framework, it would be helpful for the DFS to issue more expansive guidance than the bare-bones FAQs posted on its website. We will also learn the limits of the law the hard way – through enforcement actions, though there have been none to date. However, further clarification (in whatever form it takes) should provide comfort in the space and limit further exits as well as complex structuring exercises.

coindesk	craigslist-sellers-can-now-request-cryptocurrency-payments	Craigslist Sellers Can Now Request Cryptocurrency Payments - CoinDesk	2017-12-08T17:15	Online classifieds marketplace Craigslist has added a feature that lets users specify that they accept cryptocurrency payments. While the site's users have been able to point out in the text of their posts that they may take bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, the website now allows users to more directly advertise by selecting a check-off box for "cryptocurrency ok." First pointed out on Reddit on Dec. 7, posts with that box ticked include a note, but leaves the details about the currency to the two parties. As it stands, the feature appears to be relatively open-ended, leaving the cryptocurrency choice and the manner through which transactions are sent up to the buyer and seller. It's not entirely clear when the feature was added, through word of it began spreading on social media yesterday. Craigslist did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Additionally, Craigslist users can also filter search results by whether a seller accepts cryptocurrency or not. It's a small but notable development for the long-running classifieds site, which was founded in 1995, boasts more than 80 million ads monthly (a figure that accounts for reposts and renewals). Per Alexa, Craigslist is the 16th most popular website in the U.S., ranking 106th globally.

coindesk	crypto-crackdown-talk-draws-ire-supporters-politicians-south-korea	Korea's Crypto Crackdown Talk Draws Backlash From Users and Politicians - CoinDesk	2018-01-12T21:15	More than 100,000 South Korea residents have signed petitions asking the government there to step back from any plans to close the country's cryptocurrency exchanges. Earlier this week, the South Korean Justice Ministry announced that it was preparing legislation to close the country's online exchanges amid a speculative boom in cryptocurrencies. That shot across the bow was paired with the news that tax authorities were investigating at least some of the exchanges in Korea, and in the hours to come. Yet the proposal drew swift pushback from within the South Korean government – the president's office, in particular, said no move is "finalized" as of yet – as well as cryptocurrency supporters and traders in the country who cried foul as the statements sparked a fall in cryptocurrency prices. The public backlash against the proposed move appears to be accelerating. On the Korean president's Blue House website, more than 4,000 petitions have been filed related to "virtual currencies" since Jan. 10. One petition asking the Minister of Justice to step down in light of the move received more than 30,000 signatures on its own. According to Reuters, one petition alone has attracted more than 100,000 signatures and the website itself became inaccessible at one point due to excessive traffic. Source: president.go.kr/search Comments on the government's website included a petition from a user who claimed to have lost money due to the Justice Ministry's saber-rattling. Another petition compared cryptocurrency trading with the stock market, but claimed the latter is much more speculative. Yet another petition struck a supportive note on the development of new rules but called for the government to consult with the wider cryptocurrency community before implementing any such rules. Opposition pushback Other members of the Korean political scene are reportedly crying foul as well. A new report from Korean daily newspaper The Hankyoreh states that leaders of several opposition parties are moving to criticize what they deem a unilateral crackdown without any discussion or debate. One opposition lawmaker said the ban was not a government position, but rather one that the Ministry of Justice and, possibly the president, hold themselves. The lawmaker continued (according to a translated statement): "The government announcement should be based on detailed reviews and coordination. If there is a problem, we should warn and prepare in advance." Path toward regulation In recent months, the government has made efforts to tamp down on what it refers to as speculation surrounding cryptocurrencies. These efforts included new regulations for banks conducting transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges. On Jan. 8, regulators inspected six banks to ensure compliance with the new regulations, which included strict know-your-customer identification rules, among other measures. However, rather than comply with the new rules, some banks said they would simply cease trading with cryptocurrency exchanges altogether, according to the Korea Times. South Korea’s largest bank, Shinhan Bank, said on Friday that it would be closing down the virtual currency accounts it offers in order to comply with new regulations surrounding their use. An official from Shinhan said the bank had initially built a system to comply with the new regulations before deciding to just de-risk. "We've developed a system to introduce identifying virtual [currency] account customers in accordance with the government's efforts to curb the cryptocurrency craze. However, we decided to scrap the service enabling the trade of digital tokens which has become a serious social issue," the representative told the publication.

coindesk	crypto-malware-miners-israel-ad-networks-monero	Sneaky Crypto Malware Miners Are Targeting Ad Networks Next - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T07:00	Websites and publishers need to be prepared for cryptocurrency miners slipping into ads on their sites, according to Israeli adtech firm Spotad. The company, which operates an AI-powered advertising platform for purchasing media space, recently discovered cryptocurrency mining activity on its network, a development the company claims is becoming part of wider trend. Spotad’s AI system, named "Sarah," recently identified anomalies in the code of seemingly legitimate ads for both desktop and mobile that turned out to be a miner for the cryptocurrency monero. The JavaScript-enabled ad was designed to dupe users into clicking on a pop-up that would initiate the mining process. According to co-founder Yoav Oz, the agency responsible for the ad was unaware of the code that was embedded inside. The name of the agency or the subject of the ad has not been disclosed. "Look at what's happening today around this entire cryptocurrency world, you see how much money is involved, you see the volume picking up week by week," added Tomer Horev, chief strategy officer, who led the team that discovered the code. He told CoinDesk: "I think people identify that as the next gold rush and they will try to do everything that they can in order to produce this kind of money." Oz and Horev explained that Spotad's AI system regularly monitors for irregularities in ads and is now being trained at spotting cryptocurrency mining scripts. Some of the key signals include a lack of click or behavior patterns typically seen in legitimate ads. "It was showing a different kind of behavior where users were not clicking much, there was no engagement on the ad. That’s where we got the signals out of our system," said Horev. Monero mining Why monero though? The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around the $440 mark while bitcoin is having its bumper year, topping $18,000. According to Oz and Horev, it’s simply easier to mine surreptitiously. Horev explained: "The mining protocol for the big [cryptocurrencies], like bitcoin and bitcoin cash… to mine that kind of crypto requires high end servers and even GPU-based processing. Monero has script that can perform well on CPUs that actually reside in any desktop, laptop, and mobile device." "This type of cryptocurrency has value harvesting through low end devices," he continued. This week Russian cybersecurity firm publicized a piece of Android malware called Loapi that is spread through ad campaigns and app stores, which can mine for monero even with low-powered processors. Cryptocurrency miners have become a controversial topic after torrent site The Pirate Bay tested out a monero mining code that it claimed it was testing as an alternative to advertising. Even sites from TV network Showtime and MMA organization UFC had run code from CoinHive, which makes this type of script for mining monero. In these cases, users were not immediately aware that their CPUs were being put to work mining for cryptocurrency. Symantec published a report this week that stated there is now a cryptocurrency miner “arms race” under way as more cybercriminals seek ways to cash in on the cryptocurrency buzz, whether it’s monero or other coins like zcash or ether. Time to act Per the Symantec report, publishers and website owners need to be vigilant with the integrity of their websites’ source and be wary of any injections that may be miner scripts. Online publications typically use tools to detect fraudulent activity or inappropriate traffic on their sites. These tools will need to evolve to consider miners, added Horev. "I think here requires a different type of fraud detection that when something happens on the device itself and not on the publisher website. I’m not sure that this type of technology is yet to be introduced in fraud detection tools but I believe it’s just a matter of time," he said. For regular users, the tell-tale signs are a little easier to spot as the CPU will run at 100% and the responsiveness of the site in question, and even the entire device, will slow down. Some antivirus and security software vendors have moved to block scripts suspected of being miners. "The motivation is out there [to mine]," said Horev. "It’s time for more action to be taken and fraud and detection tools to get into the game."

coindesk	crypto-market-sheds-billions-top-100-assets-sharply	Crypto Market Sheds Billions as Top 100 Assets Down - CoinDesk	2017-12-22T12:22	It's a down day for the global cryptocurrency markets, with just three of the top 100 assets by market capitalization having posted 24-hour gains, data from Coinmarketcap reveals. At press time, the price of bitcoin, the market's largest asset, was trading below $14,000 according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index ( BPI ), up slightly from a daily low of $12,504. Notably, this figure was more than 30 percent below an all-time high of near $20,000 reached on Sunday. But whereas earlier this week bitcoin's decline coincided with an increase in the total value of the market as a whole, the value of all cryptocurrencies saw a reversal on Thursday, dropping roughly 25 percent from a high above $650 billion to a low of $480 billion today. All told, only a few assets seem safe from what appears to be an exodus from the cryptocurrency markets, with Ripple's XRP, and relatively little-known ICO tokens for GameCredits and Electroneum, posting 24-hour gains. Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency, which powers the company's open-source XRP Ledger, hit an all-time high above $1.30 yesterday, a figure that was up nearly 400 percent from its value at the beginning of the month, when it traded at just $0.25. That's not to say there aren't inter-day gains to be had in the market. CoinDesk data from Friday's morning trading session (6:00 to 12:00 UTC) indicates that cryptocurrencies NXT and Bitcoin Dark both posted gains above 15 percent within the six-hour period, though they were the only assets to gain more than 2 percent. Still, big losses were observed during the stretch as well, with Ripple's XRP down more than 12 percent for the window, and cryptocurrenices monacoin, TRON and RaiBlocks posting losses in excess of 15 percent.

coindesk	cryptocurrency-exchange-bitflyer-launches-new-eu-branch	Cryptocurrency Exchange BitFlyer Launches New EU Branch - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T10:00	Japan-based bitcoin exchange operator bitFlyer has set up shop in Europe, having already expanded to the U.S last year. The exchange announced yesterday that it had received a payment institution (PI) license to operate its services in the European Union and is initially seeking to attract professional, high-volume traders – a sector it sees as underserved in the EU. In an announcement, Andy Bryant, COO of the new European branch of the exchange, said: "Through our web interface or API, traders can get up and running quickly and benefit from some of the most robust systems, highest speeds and an interface designed with their specific needs in mind." BitFlyer is currently the sixth largest exchange by bitcoin trading volume (BTC/JPY), according to data from CoinMarketCap. Further, it claims to be the first bitcoin exchange to be regulated in Japan, the U.S. and, now, Europe. The payment institution license was granted by Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), and the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology Foundation (LHoFT). Luxembourg's Minister of Finance Pierre Gramegna was quoted as saying, "We're delighted that one of the most successful Japanese startups chose Luxembourg as their EU platform." Kicking off with just the BTC/EUR trading pair, bitFlyer indicated it is also planning to add more cryptocurrency options, including litecoin, ethereum, ethereum classic and bitcoin cash, later this year. To bring in new EU-based customers, the branch has rolled out zero percent trading fees as an introductory offer until the end of February. BitFlyer launched officially in the U.S. last November, after receiving approval from regulators including the New York State Department of Financial Services.

coindesk	cryptocurrency-exchange-coincheck-abruptly-suspends-withdrawals	Crypto Exchange Coincheck Abruptly Halts Withdrawals - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T12:32	Major Japanese exchange Coincheck has announced the suspension of a number of services today, including all withdrawals. The exchange posted on its website early this morning (UTC) that is had stopped most cryptocurrency buying and selling, and halted withdrawals of all cryptocurrencies and Japanese yen (JPY). While it's not clear at the moment what might have caused the issue, the suspension started when the exchange announced around 13:00 JST (04:00 UTC) that it had restricted deposits, trading and withdrawal of XEM, the token running on the NEM blockchain. A wider suspension on withdrawals of all cryptocurrencies as well as JPY was announced around 30 minutes later. In the following hour, trading of all cryptocurrencies was also restricted, except bitcoin. According to the latest update, other deposit methods including credit cards have also been stopped. The exchange so far has not given any statement regarding the cause of issue. According to CoinMarketCap, prices of the NEM token started to drop around the time Coincheck published its initial announcement. NEM has seen an 18 percent decline as of press time. In a statement to CoinDesk, Lon Wong, president of the NEM.io Foundation, said there are no issues with its network, saying: "As far as NEM is concerned, tech is intact. We are not forking. Also, we would advise all exchanges to make use of our multi-signature smart contract which is among the best in the landscape." CoinDesk will continue monitoring the evolving situation.

coindesk	cryptocurrency-tax-software-startup-libra-raises-7-8-million	Crypto Tax Software Startup Libra Raises $7.8 Million - CoinDesk	2017-11-27T05:00	Blockchain startup Libra has raised $7.8 million in a new Series A funding round, the company announced today. The financial resources came from a group of investors which included an unnamed family office based in Europe. Also contributing to the round, according to Libra, was seed-stage VC firm Liberty City Ventures, cryptocurrency market maker XBTO and Lee Linden, an early-stage investor who previously worked for Facebook. Of that group, Liberty City is a returning investor after putting in $500,000 in a seed stage round in 2014. Libra develops cryptocurrency and blockchain-oriented accounting and tax software, and the new funds will be put toward the development of its Libra Enterprise Platform, the startup said. "Libra's vision is to be the premier provider of next-generation accounting, audit, and tax software and data services for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry," Jake Benson, Libra's CEO, said in a statement. Founded in 2014, Libra first started with offering its LibraTax accounting software, an early entrant in the market for cryptocurrency-specific tax tools. That was the year the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notably issued guidance stating that it would treat cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as kinds of taxable property. More recently, the company has eyed the enterprise-level market, developing tools that are aimed in part at exchanges and other trading-oriented companies. Libra added a former chief risk officer from Siemens to its team in May as part of that enterprise push.

coindesk	dao-who-a-recap-of-ethers-2017-price-climb	What DAO? Charting Ether's Epic 2017 Price Climb - CoinDesk	2017-12-30T16:15	For ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum network, 2016 was defined in part by the creation and subsequent collapse of The DAO, the blockchain-based investment vehicle that raised more than $150 million at then-current prices. Yet as 2017 comes to a close, the cryptocurrency is closing the books on a banner year for its value, having surged from less than $10 one year ago to more than $700 as of press time. Buoyed by the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market. In this article, we look at some of the major market moments seen in the past 12 months, culminating with the cryptocurrency's temporary push above $800. Slow start Ether was in a rough spot as 2016 came to a close, dropping to a 7-month low at the beginning of December. That state of affairs continued as the days progressed, though the cryptocurrency's price was above $8 at the start of 2017. Yet as the chart above shows, the price of ether would slowly but surely, passing above $10 during the first week of January. That trend largely continued, advancing above that level once again two weeks later – a move that represented the last time the global market for ether below that figure. The watershed moment in that period came in early March, when the price of ether shot above $20. Indeed, that month saw budding interest from institutional investors in the market as well as the announcement that regulators in New York had approved U.S.-based startup Coinbase to begin trading ether in the state. By the time March came to a close, the price of ether was trading above $50, according to market data. Up and down we go By the latter half April, the price of ether was still trending above $40, leading some market observers to speculate that a floor was beginning to take shape. Come May 1, the price of ether would strike a new all-time high at $80, setting the stage for continued action over the following month beneath the $100 mark. A move to that level was predicted by some analysts at the time, though others suggested that it might not happen overnight. That bearish take was upended just days later when ether's price surpassed $100 for the first time. Ultimately, by the time June rolled around, the market was up roughly 3,000% since the start of the year, having ended the prior month above $200. The market was such that some observers began predicting the so-called "flippening," during which ethereum's market capitalization would surpass that of bitcoin. Even still, the weeks to come would see significant declines in overall cryptocurrency prices. On June 21, a stunning flash crash on Coinbase's GDAX exchange saw the price shoot down to $13. That move came as the ethereum network saw record high transaction activity a day prior. Despite continued volatility in June, ether prices were back above $300 by months' end. But within weeks the price had lost that support, and by the middle of July ether had fallen below $190 amid wider market declines. Indeed, that week saw what could be described as a yo-yo effect for crypto-prices, given that significant declines were followed by subsequent jumps in the overall value of the cryptocurrency market. The ramp If July represented a reversal of fortunes for ethereum, August saw markets return to a period of growth. The second week of August saw ether prices hit a 30-day high above $300, and they continued inching closer to the $400 level as the days went on. Yet by the time September came, prices seemed to struggle to advance past those earlier gains. As CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole wrote at the time, early September seemed to represent a make-or-break moment at which the market could keep climbing – or succumb to some of the weaknesses suggested in the charts. A week later, ether was back below $250. That malaise persisted until the $300 level was broken once more at the end of that month. And though prices dipped in the wake of South Korea's ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), they shrugged off the pressure once more to push above $300 once again. October saw some jitters around a planned hard fork of the ethereum network, but ultimately the price was largely unaffected by the technical considerations at hand. It was November, by comparison, that saw ether's price undertake a veritable surge, passing $440 by Nov. 24 and $500 just days later. And by the middle of December, ethereum was trading above $700, ultimately pushing to its high above $800 on Dec. 19. As shown by CoinDesk's ether price data, the cryptocurrency's value has fallen since then, and at time of writing is still above $700. Like other cryptocurrencies, ether was caught up in the 30% decline on Dec. 22, which saw the cryptocurrency market capitalization fall by billions over the course of that day.

coindesk	day-of-demos-new-blockchain-iot-consortium-kicks-off-with-use-cases-aplenty	Day of Demos: Blockchain-IoT Consortium Kicks Off With Use Cases Aplenty - CoinDesk	2017-05-26T11:45	“Who are all these people interested in this?" The question, asked by Shilpi Kumar, head of product commercialization at Filament, summed up the reaction to a Trusted IoT Alliance event sponsored by Cisco in San Jose last week. As the event showcased, the intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain is becoming more congested, with commercial products now live, instead of merely proofs-of concept. According to Kumar, only a year ago Filament, which sells IoT hardware connected to the blockchain, was often receiving confused, if not skeptical, looks when the company mentioned it was developing blockchain for IoT applications. And now, she said, looking out over a room of about 100 attendees, “there’s all these people sitting with us at that intersection.” Not only are more entrepreneurs interested in the space, but, in the past three months, calls from corporate clients asking how the blockchain plays a role in Filament’s business model have increased as well, she said. This increased interest could be, in part, the work that Bosch, Cisco and the other members of a previously unnamed group have done to create awareness of the many use cases for blockchain in the IoT industry. But, according to Anoop Nannra, the senior leader and head of distributed ledger technology and blockchain incubation at Cisco’s Strategic Innovation Group, both IoT and blockchain are nascent industries where much collaboration must be done to ensure the industry succeeds. “A number of blockchain IoT startups in this space came together and recognized common challenges... that there’s a missing identity later in IoT and maybe blockchain could potentially solve that,” said Ryan Orr, CEO of Chronicled, a blockchain startup that’s also a part of the alliance. He continued: “But if we all took a different approach with smart contracts, we’d end up with [a bunch] of different startups and processes that would create confusion and not any one would take hold of the market.” The alliance was set up late last year to develop common protocol 'primitives' to merge blockchain and IoT through smart contracts using ethereum, the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger and JP Morgan Chase’s Quorum. And, although Orr believes there will be hundreds of IoT blockchains, the alliance’s hope is that it can create interoperability between those. About half of the room consisted of blockchain aficionados, and half were individuals and companies representing the IoT space. According to Joe Pindar, CTO and director of product strategy at Gemalto, this diversity matters as the industry tries to weed through the froth and spin. Get your engines ready The alliance seems to have cut through some of the hype within the blockchain IoT space, at least in the automotive and transportation industry. Three presentations at the event focused on this sector, including a demo by Stephan Tual, founder and COO at Slock.it (of The DAO fame). Slock.it’s Share and Charge project built autonomous electric-car charging stations using Raspberry Pis. The effort also allows owners of charging stations to share their energy reserves with others. According to Tual, there are only 6,181 charging stations throughout Germany for a population of more than 82 million. But the number of Germans with electric cars and personal charging stations is estimated at over 45,000. “By sharing charging stations with each other, you can double the number of charging stations in the country,” Tual said. Slock.it’s app for the electric charging service is currently downloadable, with about a thousand charging stations currently connected. The project, which was built on ethereum but abstracted the cryptocurrency from consumers, was very popular and captured people’s attention, Tual claimed. There were hurdles, however. Installing Raspberry Pis in charging stations came with its challenges, including needing to measure temperature changes so the machine wouldn’t shut down. Further, the public key infrastructure used to secure cryptocurrency transactions is not only difficult for consumers to understand, but also comes with serious consequences in the case of loss or theft. And the tools available for blockchain are still young and underdeveloped, Tual said. For example, because the economic 'gas' price estimation is off, transactions on ethereum are not as cheap as the industry first touted. Gas is the term for the internal price for making a transaction or running smart contract on ethereum. Although Vitalik Buterin, the founder of ethereum, has said he’ll fix the issue with various hard forks, according to Tual, he argued a more sensible approach would be to initiate a state channel transaction, where each subsequent transaction and receipt is replaced by the next. This means “there's only one blockchain transaction instead of 147... so it’s way cheaper”. “Block-ifying things is not straightforward.” Tual said. “But we’ve proved that we can do blockchain development outside a [proof-of-concept] and we’re quite proud of that.” Other projects Executives from Oaken Innovations and Bosch also presented automotive applications for blockchain in the IoT space. Oaken demoed its tollbooth proof-of-concept, which uses IPFA and ethereum to allow Tesla cars to pay automatically at toll booths. The project won first place at a United Arab Emirates-sponsored blockchain hack recently. “The car goes to the tollbooth and it’s a true machine-to-machine transaction, as they both have ethereum nodes inside,” said John Gerryts, cofounder and CEO of Oaken. “We were able to reduce transaction costs, going from the traditional card models with 2% to 4% transaction fees and reduce that to a 0.1% fee.” And Bosch demoed its blockchain-based system to prevent odometer fraud. According to Timo Gessmann, director of Bosch IoT Lab, nearly one in three cars' odometers are manipulated before they are sold. With a lower number of miles on a car, both individuals and car dealers can sell a vehicle for a higher price. “Odometer numbers can be like a cryptocurrency,” said Gessmann during his presentation at the event. The company is currently testing the project as a white-label solution, offering certificates that guarantee the odometer reading is correct, because the data has been recorded on a blockchain. The company has also developed CertifiCar, a consumer-facing mobile application that tracks car mileage. Echoing Tual’s sentiments, Gessman said blockchain-based solutions are not easy builds. Ethereum transaction costs are high and it costs a considerable amount to build trust within consortia sharing data, he said. The physical-digital link Nearly all the other demos at the event focused on tracking the provenance of products along the supply chain. BitSE demoed its work with VeChain to develop unique tags for all sorts of luxury goods. Currently the company is working with the biggest wine importer in China. The company developed a tag embedded with a chip that sits on the top of the wine bottle. The chip monitors vibrations, temperature and other characteristics throughout the supply chain. And if someone wanted to tamper with the contents inside the bottle, upon opening it, they would destroy the unique tag. The company also has its blockchain-based tags in luxury brands. BitSE has more than two million product identities in production running on VeChain. Those products are worth about $450m renminbi, according to DJ Qian, CEO of BitSE. Qian said that, in June, the company will be announcing a particular luxury brand using BitSE’s tags, which will not only allow consumers and merchants to scan the tags with their phone to verify the authenticity of the piece, but will also allow them to interact with the brand. Chronicled then presented its tamper-proof crypto-seal for packages, documents and other high-value goods, such as electronics and forensic evidence bags. Sam Radocchia, the chief product officer at Chronicled, said the company has been working with the pharmaceutical industry too. Filament also demoed a sharing economy handheld drill. The drill contained what Filament calls “the path”, a small Bluetooth-enabled device with a built-in contract that allows people to lease the tool for a specific amount of time. When someone signs a digital lease, the information is sent to the drill and an LED light on the tool lights up green indicating it’s ready for use. When the lease expires, the drill ceases to function. “It’s kind of gimmicky,” said Filament’s Kumar. “I don’t think we should have a sharing economy for drills [due to their short lifespan]... but our clients are thinking about other industrial infrastructure.” For instance, many construction companies are wondering if they can not only monetize the leasing of their large equipment, but also monetize the data that’s collected from those machines in use. Experimentation and governance While a legal entity has not yet been created, the alliance has set up a working governance structure. So far, the alliance’s model will have 21 industry board seats with five executive board seats. Two in-person meetings per year will see the board review new proposals and allocate funding. And as the alliance grows, smaller committee working groups will be created to focus on particular niches. “It was also important to show that there was some validation of the technical idea, that it makes sense to do a blockchain-agnostic IoT-oriented working group,” said Zaki Manian, founder of SKUChain, a DLT startup focused on supply chain, and one of the founding members of the alliance. “The initial thing we put some effort into was a basic proof-of-concept of this idea of a unified registry.” The unified registry allows companies to put IoT device identities onto a blockchain and give each device its own private key. The API, which the alliance announced about a month ago, allows all these registries on separate blockchains to be unified. “We clearly demonstrated with limited resources that we can make this work,” Manian said. And it worked without recreating the wheel, said Nannra. Instead, the group developed a model for portability of identities and interoperability between blockchains. Yet, the group’s mission isn’t to create standards – Orr thinks it’s too early for that. Instead, the aim is to build an open-source blockchain base layer via which collaborating companies can then compete with the applications built on top, he said. According to Orr, the group is focusing on getting 15 pilots running in the next 12 months. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Filament.

coindesk	decentralization-vs-scale-studies-explore-cryptos-growing-struggle	Decentralization vs Scale: Crypto's Growing Struggle - CoinDesk	2018-01-24T13:00	You can't have your cake and eat it too, the old saying goes. In the cryptocurrency space, the big question is whether you can have decentralization and scale it too. The struggle between these two goals has become more noticeable as a rush of new enthusiasts have entered the space, lured by the technology being floated as a fix to many of the world's problems (well, that and greed). Underscoring the urgency of the problem, a number of researchers are studying whether there's a balance to be struck between decentralization – the key non-financial motivation for cryptocurrency and blockchain excitement – and these networks' ability to scale to an ever-growing number of users. Cornell University researcher Adem Efe Gencer explains the predicament well, telling CoinDesk: "The key impetus behind the interest in blockchains is decentralization of power among entities with minimal trust relationships. But, there's a fundamental tension between scale and decentralization. While we know how to get scale, scaling solutions may require compromising the decentralized nature of blockchains." And this dilemma has become more serious as users face deep transaction backlogs and rising transaction fees on the most popular blockchains dealing with the weight of increased adoption. In response, many wonder whether the blockchain deserves all the attention it's currently receiving – or if it's yet another overhyped technology sector where expectations outpace actual usefulness. At this point, there are solutions under development, such as bitcoin's Lightning Network, but there are always trade-offs to be made. Gencer's new paper and a handful of others recently published explore just how decentralized the most popular blockchains are, and how resistant they will be in the future to being taken taken over by a controlling force as new technology for scaling is added. Mirroring the debates in the bitcoin community about the best way to overcome the problem, the researchers each stressed different possible solutions in their findings: on-chain, off-chain and at the consensus protocol level. Just how decentralized? In their paper, Gencer and his co-authors aim to "scientifically quantify" the decentralization of the networks bitcoin and ethereum. To do this, the paper brings together a range of metrics, including how many miners (the stakeholders that order and verify transactions on the network with the use of computer hardware) a network has, how many nodes, how much bandwidth it takes to send blocks across the network and so forth. Looking at this big picture can help researchers to potentially address the scalability problem. Gencer told CoinDesk: "While we know how to get scale, scaling solutions may require compromising the decentralized nature of blockchains." With that in mind, the research sheds some light on the "viability of different scaling proposals." For example, the block size can be increased up to 1.7 times to improve on-chain scaling without harming decentralization in some ways, the authors found. It's worth noting Gencer and his colleagues' findings have been debated fiercely on social media. Because decentralization is such a complex property to measure in a system like bitcoin, many contend other elements of decentralization would need to be taken into account to get the full picture. The scaling 'triangle' Another quantitatively focused paper exploring the issue was published on arXiv last week by Greg Slepak, the founder of decentralized technology non-profit OkTurtles. The paper describes the "basic theory" behind the scalability problem by way of a triangle (another researcher, Ocean Protocol founder Trent McConaghy, independently came up with this same idea). Each point of the triangle represents one of the three properties that blockchains need – scale, the ability to support many users; decentralization, a state of affairs in which no one entity controls the system; and consensus, the agreement between each node on the validity of transactions. Just as one line of a triangle can touch only two of the three points, so too, are blockchain developers only able to focus and succeed in two of the three properties necessary for decentralized blockchains. For instance, blockchain developers can have a system that scales and reaches consensus, but it will be at the expense of full decentralization. Still, Slepak's research was more optimistic than Gencer's, since the paper claims there's evidence that off-chain networks, such as Lightning Network, can "get around" this tricky trio of trade-offs. To do so, the paper contends, off-chain solutions like bitcoin's Lightning Network can "relax" the definition of consensus. Rather than requiring nodes to hold every transaction that ever happens within the system, nodes only need to keep track of some transactions requested by users in 'rare moments.'" Arguing that his research describes, in more formal terms, the trade-offs that have been at the heart of bitcoin's years-long scaling debate, Slepak told CoinDesk: "This seems pretty important to me given the fuss around [bitcoin's] block-size debate." The base layer Meanwhile, University College London postdoctoral researcher Shehar Bano has also been researching the scaling/decentralization conundrum, but as it relates to each particular blockchain's consensus protocol. In a paper titled " Systemization of Knowledge," Bano aggregates a number of different consensus protocols, including proof-of-work (which bitcoin uses) and proof-of-stake, and compares them, in order to figure out where development is wanting. "Researchers can then look at it and think, 'Oh, I can contribute here,' or 'Oh, here's a gap,'" Bano said. Despite the sprawling scope of the paper, decentralization was one of the main trade-offs Bano mentioned in conversation with CoinDesk. "Because what shows up in some blockchains is that, while the system is decentralized, somehow due to the governance structures or the nature of the protocol, centralization happens again," she said. "We can see this with bitcoin mining," where just three pools account for roughly 56 percent of the hashing power right now. Solving the problem will hinge on developing better consensus protocols, Bano argued, concluding: "The other features are really the icing on top of the cake. Consensus protocols are the cake."

coindesk	decentralized-token-exchange-radar-relay-raises-3-million	Decentralized Token Exchange Radar Relay Raises $3 Million - CoinDesk	2017-12-19T22:30	The team behind Radar Relay, a decentralized token exchange built on top of the 0x protocol, has raised $3 million in venture funding. The round was led by Blockchain Capital and also included Batshit Crazy Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Digital Currency Group, Kindred Ventures, Kokopelli Capital, Notation Capital, Reciprocal Ventures, Sparkland Capital, SV Angel and V1.VC. Radar Relay aims to serve as a hub atop the 0x protocol, which is designed to act as a decentralized exchange mechanism for ERC-20 complaint tokens on the ethereum network. An initial coin offering (ICO) tied to 0x raised $24 million earlier this year. According to Alan Curtis, Radar Relay's CEO, the funding will go toward expanding its existing team. "We have 15 people now and the funds will be used for platform expansion, talent acquisition, and building out an integrations team," Curtis told CoinDesk. Radar Relay has currently launched a beta version that runs on the decentralized ethereum network and requires users to get access to it via a Brave or Metamask browser. Record on 0xtracker shows that the most recent daily trading volume was around $60,000 to $70,000. Curtis said the Radar Relay platform is expected to come out of the beta development stage sometime in the first quarter of 2018.

coindesk	dept-of-veterans-affairs-wants-industry-to-present-roles-for-blockchain	Dept of Veterans Affairs Wants Industry to Propose Use Cases for Blockchain - CoinDesk	2018-01-18T10:00	The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is still interested in using blockchain in the search for greater efficiencies, though it's not yet sure what it would use the tech for. Speaking at a panel on Tuesday, VA's chief technology officer, Charles Worthington, said his focus is more on finding the appropriate technology to solve the department's problems, as reported by GovernmentCIO Magazine. He continued: "We really would be looking to industry to surface use cases for us … I think we're going to be coming to industry with problems we have, and if you think blockchain is an appropriate solution, bring it to us." The chief problems faced by the department are interoperability and sharing health information between entities, Worthington explained. While VA has tried to solve these issues in the past, he believes anyone trying to apply blockchain would encounter the same stumbling blocks that faced other solutions over the last two decades. "We're really looking to industry for the best ideas, and trying to be nimble enough to take advantage of those as the market evolves," Worthington said. While he is interested in what industry can provide in terms of blockchain solutions, he said, he is more interested in how the technology can solve problems people are not even thinking about yet. Worthington sees the development of solutions to these new ideas as a "missing middle" between blockchain technology today and its use in health record interoperability, he said. At present, there are just not that many use cases for blockchain within the department, he added. A bill introduced in the House in 2016 would have had the department use a blockchain ledger to store appointment information. However, while the bill was agreed in committee, it has not been passed or voted on in two years.

coindesk	deutsche-bank-blockchain-opportunities-huge	Deutsche Bank: Blockchain Opportunities Are 'Huge' - CoinDesk	2017-12-11T03:00	Blockchain technology could represent a major shift in how companies conduct their business, according to Deutsche Bank's chief investment officer. In a slide presentation this month, Christian Nolting, also the bank’s global head of wealth, and Marcus Muller, global head of the CIO office, explained how digital currencies and blockchains work and predicted where they would go in the future. According to the presentation, the “opportunities associated with blockchain technologies are huge,” and could be fully put into practice within the next few years. The bankers predicted that roughly 10% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) would be tracked or otherwise "regulated" by a blockchain by 2027. The presentation said: “We expect that the blockchain will change the business model of companies in a sustained way. The blockchain technology enables a faster and cheaper exchange of assets and financial products between individuals without an [intermediary], which reduces the asymmetry of information between the individuals.” Lukewarm on currencies While blockchain technology is promising, cryptocurrencies are less so, according to the presentation. The bank is classifying digital currencies as "highly speculative" given their lack of intrinsic value or backing from a central bank. Though cryptocurrencies could represent an alternative to fiat currencies, especially in nations with runaway inflation, they need more regulation and security to become a proper asset class, according to the presentation. Digital currencies in general could evolve in a number of possible ways, with some of the main factors affecting their growth being government intervention and competition between different currencies. The potential for hard forks creating new currencies is also a potential cause for concern, since it could lead to inflation, the presentation stated. "In addition, central banks could develop their own cryptocurrencies and replace the private ones in the market," it said.

coindesk	dnata-taps-ibm-for-air-cargo-blockchain-pilot	Dnata Taps IBM for Air Cargo Blockchain Pilot - CoinDesk	2017-11-24T11:15	Dnata, provider of air and travel services in the Middle East, has announced the completion of a proof-of-concept examining blockchain's potential in the Dubai air cargo industry. The pilot saw participation from project partners IBM, Emirates Innovation Lab and Flydubai Cargo, and looked at blockchain's potential to address issues across various aspects of airfreight, including security and operations, as well as legal aspects, a press release indicates. The "successful" trial was conducted on a jointly developed logistics platform, utilizing blockchain for supply chain transactions, taking a purchase order from the origin to the final destination. Stating that blockchain technology and its potential is neither easy to understand or appreciate, Neetan Chopra, senior vice president for IT strategic services at Emirates Group, said: "It is imperative to carry out such business experiments and trials so that participants can experience the benefits of breakthrough technologies in a live environment." The move follows the release of white paper by air transport IT firm SITA, detailing the use of smart contracts in the air transport industry. While, Air France is also testing blockchain technology for supply chain tracking.

coindesk	dont-use-blockchain-unless-really-need-one	Don't Use a Blockchain Unless You Really Need One - CoinDesk	2018-01-14T11:15	Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and a former editor-in-chief of American Banker. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers. Last month I had the plum assignment of interviewing Naval Ravikant for CoinDesk's Most Influential in Blockchain 2017 series. During our conversation, the AngelList co-founder shared an insight that I just couldn't fit into the profile, but it was pretty mind-blowing, so I'm going to lay it on you here. Stepping back, for the last few years I've watched the cryptocurrency community's efforts to disrupt finance and, in parallel, the self-sovereign identity movement's attempt to decentralize control of personal data. By studying the former, I've learned the importance of censorship-resistance – the inability of a third party to veto a transaction between peers. From the latter I've become familiar with the concept of data portability : the notion that consumers should be able to easily and securely transfer their records from one service to another – be it a bank, a doctor's office or a social media platform – the way they can port their mobile number when they get a new phone. What Ravikant helped me to grok is that these two ideas are tightly related – and so the fact that both digital currency and digital identity projects are employing distributed ledgers is more than coincidence or fashion. Because you don't use a blockchain unless you really need it. Despite some of the hype, blockchains are "incredibly inefficient," Ravikant said. "It's worth paying the cost when you need the decentralization, but it's not when you don't." Walled gardens Most CoinDesk readers are probably familiar with the usefulness of decentralization in a monetary context (and if you're not, take a look at recent articles about cryptocurrency adoption in Iran, Venezuela, Russia and, ahem, the alt-right ). The neutrality, censorship-resistance and openness of a permissionless network mean it will attract the odious along with the oppressed, and the software doesn't decide which is which. But why is decentralization worthwhile in the data use case? "Today, every piece of content and media you have is living somewhere owned by somebody," Ravikant explained. "Your data is inside Facebook, your photos are inside a Google silo or an Apple silo." Then the conversation took a turn that I have to admit made me roll my eyes at first. "If someone creates a new Pokemon card game or a Magic the Gathering card game" online, he continued (cue my eye-roll), the characters are "living and owned by a certain company in a certain format. You can't just go and reuse those assets." This is why CryptoKitties, the app running atop ethereum that allows users to buy, collect, sell and "breed" unique digital pets, is more than just a goof. Although it's not a fully decentralized app, Ravikant said, it offers a glimmer of hope for such an innovation. "Those assets are on the blockchain and you own that kitty and anyone can show up and remix that asset," Ravikant said. "They could put your CryptoKitty into a different kind of game," say a fighting game. Yeah, I still thought, so what? But then Ravikant zoomed out the lens and talked about the broad implications of this seemingly trivial example. "Assets that normally would have been in a silo are, in a sense, censorship-resistant to developers," Ravikant said. "New developers come along and as long as you, the user, agree to share your content, they can reuse your content to give you new applications." Hence the potential of a distributed database. "Imagine if every mobile app shared the same database underneath, or had access to the same data, what they could do," Ravikant said. And then he tied it all together. "All your data today is censored in terms of what boundaries it can cross and what applications it can live in," he said. "These silos are a form of censorship." Whoa. Better off centralized? To be sure, Ravikant has skin in the game here (or, if you prefer to think of it this way, he's talking his book) – he was an early investor in Blockstack, a startup trying to build a new decentralized internet where users control their data. Blockstack also used CoinList, the platform Ravikant founded and spun out from AngelList, to conduct its token sale last year. And unlike digital cash, identity is not yet a clear-cut, proven use case for blockchains. You can read some skeptical takes on the matter from some of the smartest members of the identerati here, here and here. Some even question the need for decentralization in this context. "Large services that control large portions of a market gain power over individuals, but large businesses tend to stay in business longer and have more resources in case users have problems," noted a report last year from the blockchain and smart contracts discussion group of the Kantara Initiative, an identity trade group. "Further, there is a long tradition of innovation in client-side applications and centralized services meant to be employed by individuals for the purpose of their own empowerment," the report continued, citing PGP encryption and ad blockers as examples. Then again, how many people do you know outside of tech circles who use PGP, or even know what it is? Heck, how many techies you know use it? Perhaps this is revealed preference, and most people just don't care about autonomy – but wouldn't they, if they took a second to think it through? Clearly, the cause of empowering individuals in a digital world has a long way to go, and now is hardly the time for complacency. Which is why Ravikant's vision is so captivating. "We're going to see a giant remixing of the internet as all the data becomes unshackled from the silo that it's in," he told me. In the future, he concluded, "any data you own... will be under your control and you'll be able to pass it into any app." I sure hope so.

coindesk	ecb-official-calls-for-tax-on-bitcoin-transactions	ECB Official Calls for Tax on Bitcoin Transactions - CoinDesk	2018-01-03T15:10	Bitcoin should be regulated and even taxed, according to a European Central Bank (ECB) governing council member. Ewald Nowotny, head of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Austria's central bank, said in an interview with German paper Sueddeutsche Zeitung that anyone who participates in a financial transaction should be clearly identified, on top of paying value-added tax (VAT). According to the Daily Mail, the banker also expressed concerns about potential uses in money laundering, saying: "It can't be allowed that we've just decided to stop printing 500-euro notes to fight money laundering, that we've slapped strict rules on every tiny savings club, and then have to watch people blithely laundering money around the globe with bitcoin." Nowotny's comments come just days after ECB executive board member Benoît Cœuré told Caixin Global that bitcoin is in a bubble. Like his Austrian peer, Cœuré said one of the main concerns surrounding bitcoin relates to tax evasion and money laundering. Cœuré continued to say that bitcoin was supported mainly by speculation and "there is a risk of large capital losses which investors should be aware of." Both bankers declared that bitcoin is not a currency, with Cœuré adding that investors would not be able to use it as a means of payment. However, he did say that distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general shows promise for wholesale and retail applications, noting the ECB's recent joint venture with the Bank of Japan to research use cases for the tech. While central banks worldwide are looking into how to use DLT to update or replace existing financial systems, the technology is still too young for any meaningful implementation, he said.

coindesk	end-of-inflation-the-radical-vision-of-futures-backed-cryptocurrency_central_banks	End of Inflation? The Radical Vision of Futures-Backed Cryptocurrency - CoinDesk	2018-01-15T13:20	Veteran user experience designer James Zdralek is on a mission to reimagine the way central banks run, using cryptocurrencies. Part psychologist, part accountant, part industrial designer, the innovator working with user experience at enterprise software firm SAP has devised a way to merge cryptocurrency with modern financial instruments that could make national currencies appreciate in value. But in exchange for this brave new world of banking, central banks could risk losing the monetary control they exercise when large-scale problems threaten an economy. More than that, they could undermine their own existence. Simply put, this new breed of national currencies would be backed by cryptocurrencies that are in turn backed by the actual output of a nation's industries. This network of cryptocurrencies could theoretically result not only in a natural interest rate – reflecting actual market conditions rather than policymakers' wishes – but also built-in stability, Zdralek told CoinDesk. "Those two things combined, would be much better than bitcoin, much better than fiat currency," he said. Since completing an early version of his research last year, Zdralek has shopped the idea to central banks at SAP's Executive Central Banking Summit in May and at Sibos in October, and he's now turning his attention to members of academia to further explore the concept. If successful, Zdralek believes the campaign within SAP's experimental Ideation Center in Canada could eventually result in the end of inflation and the movement of the resulting lost value into the hands of the people who actually spend that money. "This is a beyond-the-edge concept which is uncomfortable for some people," Zdralek told CoinDesk, adding: "In my opinion, this is a good warm-up before the big race." 'Simple complexity' The biggest obstacle Zdralek said he's faced since taking his ideas on the road has been people's difficulty understanding the proposal. Originally released to the public in October by the SAP Ideation Center, the 44-page paper lays out how users could interact with the seemingly complex system as easily as they swipe a debit card. "It ends up being the same simple kind of monetary system on the surface," said Zdralek. "But behind the scenes, it's more complex to create a very stable value and natural interest rate." Such stability relies on underlying "representative currencies" that function similarly to how government currencies like the U.S. dollar used to be redeemable for gold. But instead, the new currency would be backed by assets traded on a blockchain. By mitigating the role of a central issuer, these currencies would compete for users in an economy driven by blockchain-enabled smart contracts that automatically trade maturing futures forward. Specifically, Zdralek's work would require three asset types to be embedded into crypto-tokens. The first type of currency is backed by shares representing the ownership of a factory. The second is backed by the inventory of a company, and would give users a stake in what the report calls the "stored output of that factory." In Zdralek's concept, central bankers or other currency issuers would then create a third currency backed by a specific kind of future called a prepaid forward contract that aggregates the futures-backed cryptocurrencies. Zdralek argued that, like with a mutual fund, this third currency could produce an extremely stable value and natural interest rate, growing the economy without the creation of bubbles. In other words, instead of value being degraded by an inflation rate imposed by the central bank, citizens who hold the currency might actually receive a return on its value – or at least would not lose it. From the original report: "Adding only the first two types of currency to a blockchain infrastructure would still require a traditional banking industry to facilitate debt, adjust the size of the money supply and to finance new ventures. The third type, futures-back currency, can replace these functions." Existing interest While the idea of a central bank willingly adopting a technology that might make some of its services unnecessary might seem far-fetched, already a considerable number of central banks have explored its use. Among the earliest central banks interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain have been those whose legacy systems have been of concern for fraud and corruption. The central banks of Ukraine and Venezuela, which have both experienced recent corruption concerns, are among the first such institutions to take steps towards issuing their own cryptocurrencies. And Barbados has already issued a cryptocurrency pegged to its dollar as part of a larger effort to fight concerns the nation is a risk for money laundering. While larger central banks such as the Bank of England and the Central Bank of Canada have also expressed interest in so-called central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, they each have recently backed off those efforts to focus on other blockchain use cases. But Zdralek hopes his concept could have an impact, bringing them back around to the idea. "Central banks are very measured and slow, but they're not blind," Zdralek told CoinDesk. "So, they are doing their research, they're looking at how things are going to change, and they're going to take a measured pace at it." He added: "But it's definitely a thing where change is coming." Ending inflation While such an evolution would certainly affect the way central banks do business, the potential benefits extend all the way down to the way normal people invest. At the highest level, potential benefits of a Central Bank cryptocurrency include a central bank including saving money on the cost of issuing a currency and a smaller targeted inflation rate, according to Dong He, the deputy director of the International Monetary Fund. Speaking at the Central Bank Summit on Blockchain, hosted by blockchain startup Ripple in November, he described the potential risks and benefits to a crowd that included central bankers from as far away as Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan and Hong Kong. "The balance of benefits and costs surely needs further study," he said. But to Zdralek, there's a much simpler reason for central banks to adopt: the costs of inflation, even among the stablest economies in the world. While the problem of money losing value over time is not new, Zdralek believes he's finally discovered a way to end it with blockchain technology. In interview, Zdralek posited that the return rate resulting from his idea for a futures-backed cryptocurrency could not only help stabilize inflation, but actually increase the value of the retirement savings for those who can't afford an investment advisor. While people in their 60s now may be able to retire comfortably with a million dollars in savings, Zdralek said that won't always be the case. And instead of waiting for someone else to fix the problem, he believes a smarter currency could do it. "A million dollars is going to be poverty level in the long term of things," he said, concluding: "That's where a stable currency with a natural interest rate and a natural type of inflation can help."

coindesk	ether-bucks-bearish-trend-to-hold-above-1200	Ether Bucks Bearish Trend to Hold Above $1,200 - CoinDesk	2018-01-09T15:05	The price of ether, the native token of the ethereum platform, is bucking the bearish trend seen in top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. As per data source OnChainFX, ether (ETH) has appreciated by 7.44 percent in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, bitcoin, litecoin, stellar lumens and dash are down at least 3 percent each. Tron is down 11 percent, while Ripple (XRP) has depreciated by 8.9 percent on the day. As of writing, ETH is trading at $1,232.34 levels. However, as CoinDesk reported today, ethereum's recent price rises are masking technical problems related to some blockchain operations, issues that could hinder growth if not resolved. Also, as per CoinMarketCap, trading volumes almost doubled to $8.45 billion yesterday from the Jan. 4 volume of $4.6 billion. The 24-hour trading volume stands at $7.66 billion. A high volume rally indicates strong hands are at play. Despite being well bid, ETH is still down 4.25 percent from a record $1,267 set yesterday. And while there is no reason to panic, the technical chart does show early signs of bull market exhaustion. Ether chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows: Spinning top candle : Yesterday's spinning top candle shows indecision in the marketplace or bull market exhaustion. 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) continue to slope upwards in favor of the bulls. The relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions. View A close (as per UTC) below $1,118.30 (Sunday's high) would confirm spinning top bearish reversal and could yield a short-term pullback to sub-$1,000 levels. The upward sloping 10-day MA indicates dips could be short-lived. If prices see a sustained move above the previous day's high of $1,228, the big level to watch out for is $1,664 (261.8 percent Fibonacci extension).

coindesk	ether-hits-psychological-milestone-of-1000	$1,000: Ethereum Tops Price Milestone in Market First - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T15:15	Days after hitting $900, ethereum's native ether token, ether, has topped $1,000 for the first time in its history. After spending two days mostly below its previous high of $900, ether went on a rally Wednesday, and hit its latest milestone of $1,000 early Thursday morning, according to data from CoinDesk's Ethereum Price Chart ( EPI ). Despite the increase, however, it remains as the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, having recently lost the second place spot to Ripple’s XRP token. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP's lead has grown to more than $40 billion in the last day. Thursday also saw the overall cryptocurrency market cap jump past $770 billion according to CoinMarketCap, marking new highs just weeks after a correction saw the figure drop to $418 billion. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin, is down on the day, having dropped from its week's high of $15,393, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index ( BPI ). Bitcoin has mostly traded sideways over the last week, with prices staying in the $13,000 to $14,000 range interrupted briefly with a drop to nearly $12,000 on Dec. 30. Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market cap remains just below 33%, having dropped from 43% over the last week, according to CoinMarketCap.

coindesk	ether-price-outlook-gloomy-falling-1k	Ether Price Outlook Gloomy After Again Falling Below $1K - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T15:00	The price of ether, ethereum's native token, is likely to head south unless the bulls can quickly pull the price back over $1,160 levels, price chart analysis indicates. On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, ether hit a one-week low of $905 at 11:50 UTC today. A sharp recovery from the last week's low of $757 ran out of steam at $1,164 over the weekend. The subsequent drop to sub-$1000 levels has left a lower high (bearish action) on the charts. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $930 levels on GDAX exchange. ETH has depreciated by 8 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data from OnChainFX. Further, prices are down 20 percent from the weekend high of $1164. Still, the technical charts are now showing oversold conditions. The price charts indicate that ether will mostly likely erase the 22 percent gains made since last week's low of $757 in a slow and steady manner over the next couple of days. 4-hour chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows: ETH left a lower high at the key 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $1,166.71 over the weekend. The decline witnessed in the following 24 hours yielded a bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average (MA) and 100-day MA (short-term average cuts long-term average from above). The rejection at 61.8 percent Fibonacci level indicates the corrective rally has ended and the bears have regained control. 50-day MA carries a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards), while the 100- and 200-day MAs are neutral. The relative strength index (RSI) shows scope for further losses (being below 50.00) and well short of the oversold territory (below 30.00). Ether chart The daily RSI shows a triple top breakdown -like pattern, indicating potential for a sell-off back towards to last week's low of $757. The ascending trendline could offer support at $752. The 50-day MA is close to being topped out (shedding bullish bias). View Ether looks set to close below $927.29 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July low to January high) and extend losses to $775 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) in the near-term. A violation there would expose trendline support of $752. A close (as per UTC) below $752 may signal a longer-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. Bullish scenario: A close (as per UTC) above $1,164.97 (Jan. 20 high) would revive the bullish view.

coindesk	ethereum-is-quietly-closing-in-on-record-price-highs	Ethereum Is Quietly Closing In on Record Price Highs - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T14:45	Ethereum's ether token could revisit record highs very soon, courtesy of last week's bullish price action, the price charts suggest. The cryptocurrency, which was notably given a higher rating than bitcoin and Ripple's XRP last week by Florida-based Weiss Ratings, is up 18 percent week-on-week, says data source OnChainFX. As of writing, ether (ETH) is changing hands at $1,211. Having bottomed out at $905 last Tuesday, the price of ETH rose to a 12-day high of $1,224 on Coinbase's GDAX exchange – a rebound that left a higher low (bullish set up) on the price chart. Furthermore, previous day's 12 percent rise (UTC) was backed by a 78 percent jump in trading volumes, shows CoinMarketCap. A high-volume rally indicates strong hands are at play. Notably, prices on South Korean exchanges are again being used in the calculation of global average by CoinMarketCap, having been removed in early January with no announcement and causing a drop in global prices. Thus, ETH might have received a slight boost, with prices in South Korea still carrying a premium of approximately $70 over those on western exchanges. However, the Korean price premium has dropped sharply from the heady heights seen at the turn of the year. So, the price rise appears to be more or less legitimate. Looking at the charts, ETH witnessed a bull reversal yesterday and could soon revisit record highs above $1,400. Daily chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows: ETH bottomed out around $927.29 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of July to January rally). The higher lows pattern, as indicated by the rising trendline, indicates the bulls are in a dominant position. On Sunday, ETH closed (as per UTC) well above $1,166 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 13 to Jan. 17 sell-off). The 5-day MA and 10-day MA trend northwards, marking a bullish setup. A close above 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement indicates a bull reversal – i.e. the previous trend (bull run) has resumed. So, the drop to $1,150 seen today could be transient. View ETH could revisit record highs above $1,400 in the short-run if the bulls defend the rising trendline support over the next couple of days. In the larger scheme of things, only a daily close (as per UTC) below $905 (Jan. 23 low) would revive the bearish outlook.

coindesk	european-energy-firms-trial-blockchain-trading-marketplace	European Energy Firms Trial Blockchain Trading Marketplace - CoinDesk	2017-10-26T14:00	Two European energy providers tested a new blockchain-based trading platform earlier this month. Italian gas and electricity firm Enel and Germany-based E.On conducted the trial using technology developed by IT firm Ponton, according to statements. Like other trials of its kind that have taken place in recent months, the energy firms explored how peer-to-peer trading can facilitate direct sales of power. The idea is the technology could help reduce the costs associated with power distribution intermediaries and provide more transparency to the process. The test initiative formed part of the "Enerchain" initiative, a broader attempt baked by 30 European utility providers. Some of the earlier work was made public in May, according to a Bloomberg report at the time. In statements, representatives from the firms involved with the latest trial struck an optimistic tone about the prospects for the tech in the energy space. "The Enerchain initiative is a good example of open, cross-industry collaboration. We all believe in the enormous potential that blockchain technology has for the new energy world and especially for our customers,” Matthew Timms, E.On's Chief Digital Officer said in a press release. As previously reported by CoinDesk, blockchain potential use cases for the energy sector include peer-to-peer (P2P) trading networks, customer billing, and renewable energy certificates. Further, European energy giants are not the only companies looking to blockchain to facilitate decentralization. Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Company ( TEPCO ), for example, has been moving to explore applications of the tech. As its venture capital director, Jeffrey Char, told CoinDesk, the firm is looking at how it could shift the country's centralized nuclear power system to a more decentralized model.

coindesk	ex-cftc-commissioner-joins-crypto-exchange-as-regulatory-adviser	Ex-CFTC Commissioner Joins Crypto Exchange as Adviser - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T08:30	Bart Chilton, the former commissioner of the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is doubling down on his stated desire for a regulated market to foster the development of cryptocurrency trading. The former U.S. government regulator announced on Jan. 23 that he will join the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Omega One as an adviser, focusing on regulatory aspects in the U.S. and abroad as the exchange eyes attracting retail and institutional investors. In an email response to CoinDesk, Chilton explained that one of the reasons he signed up for the new role is because the team at Omega One also shares the belief that appropriate regulation should be in place to facilitate the growth of cryptocurrency trading. "We [Alex Gordon-Brandor, CEO of Omega One, and Chilton] spoke for a while and [Gordon-Brandor] explained how Omega One wanted to break the mold of most in the digital world of staying away from all things regulatory or government like a hot oven. He said we need transparency and disclosure and to abide by appropriate rules," Chilton explained. In addition to advising on regulatory issues, Chilton said he is keen on potential involvement in the Brooklyn Project, a cross-industry regulatory endeavor for the crypto space launched by blockchain tech firm ConsenSys, which is also a partner of the Omega One. The news marks a notable move by a former government regulator to take part in shaping the development of cryptocurrency trading by taking his previous experience in pushing through regulations to the emerging industry. Serving at the CFTC from 2007 to 2014, Chilton held a powerful position in enforcing market regulation and implementing position limits in bid to protect investor benefits. He also openly opposed the legislative delay of the Dodd-Frank act, which was enacted for investor protection in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Previously, Chilton has made comments arguing that, while the U.S. should embrace the potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, he believes proper regulations are needed for a sustainable growth of the industry, especially when it comes to protecting investors. Another issue that regulation may solve, as he has suggested, is the notorious volatility of bitcoin's price.

coindesk	former-ripple-exec-invests-57-5-million-in-digital-money-platform-uphold	Former Ripple Exec Invests $57.5 Million in Uphold - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T12:30	Digital money platform Uphold today announced it has received a $57.5 million investment from former Fed Reserve senior analyst and Ripple chief risk officer Greg Kidd. Kidd, who will join Uphold's board of directors, will also help fund the creation of a research and development arm, to be called Uphold Labs, through his investment vehicle Hard Yaka. Kidd has previously invested in Coinbase, Square and Twitter. In a statement, the investor praised Uphold's scalability, as well as its compliance practices. In addition to forming Uphold Labs, the investment will help fill Uphold's loss assurance to roughly 20 percent of its crypto holdings, protecting its users from potential losses due to cryptocurrency volatility or other issues. Kidd told CoinDesk: "Because of the strength of Uphold's compliance and controls, I'm willing to pledge a certain amount of my balance sheet, or the balance sheet of my venture company... as a reserve. That means that if there was some adverse effect at Uphold that might put it otherwise in a position of operating as a fractional reserve, this is like an insurance program that will make sure that user balances are protected." A spokesperson for Uphold said the licensing revenue and development wing will receive 20 percent of the funding, which will be used to add more cryptocurrencies to increase the firm's connectivity to financial systems, as well as for use in Ripple-related projects. Then, 45 percent will go to equity, and the remaining 35 percent will be shifted to its reserve balance sheet. The partnership will help Uphold provide "unprecedented asset protection," said chief executive Adrian Steckel. Formerly called Bitreserve, before its rebrand in 2015, Uphold offers foreign exchange and international remittances in bitcoin and fiat currencies. It also provides e-commerce services.

coindesk	france-creates-working-group-for-cryptocurrency-regulation	France Creates Working Group for Cryptocurrency Regulation - CoinDesk	2018-01-16T13:30	The French minister of the economy, Bruno Le Maire, has announced the creation of a working group to develop cryptocurrency regulations. In a speech Monday, Le Maire said that the working group will be responsible for proposing guidelines and drafting a framework on cryptocurrency regulations with the objective being to prevent the technology's misuse, French daily Les Echos reports. The minister stated: "We want a stable economy. We reject the risks of speculation and the possible financial diversions linked to bitcoin." Le Maire indicated that the working group will be headed by Jean-Pierre Landau, the former deputy governor of the country's central bank, the Bank of France. “Jean-Pierre Landau's mission will be responsible for proposing guidelines on the evolution of regulations and to better control development and prevent their use for the purpose of tax evasion, money laundering or for financing criminal activities and terrorism," he said. The move to establish a cryptocurrency working group comes a month after Le Maire proposed a discussion on bitcoin regulation at a G-20 summit in 2018. He said that he will ask Argentina to put bitcoin on the agenda during an upcoming gathering in April. "There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how... with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin," he stated at the time. Yesterday, a director of Germany's central bank expressed similar sentiment, saying that cryptocurrencies must be regulated at a global scale, not just on a national level.

coindesk	france-gives-go-ahead-for-blockchain-trading-of-unlisted-securities	France Approves Blockchain Trading of Unlisted Securities - CoinDesk	2017-12-11T09:00	The French government has given the official nod for trading unlisted securities using blockchain technology, Reuters reports. According to the article, the government has adopted new rules that will enable banks and fintech firms to establish blockchain platforms for unlisted securities trading. The change will allow the trading of the assets without relying on middlemen and theoretically at near-instant speeds. The country's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said that the new rules would be a boon for Paris as a financial center, continuing: "The use of this new technology will allow fintech firms and other financial actors to develop new ways of trading securities that are faster, cheaper, more transparent and safer." The move comes as part of the country's goals to foster Paris as a hub for financial innovation. The French government has been working on various blockchain efforts including a blockchain working group launched this May to research blockchain implementations, explore its benefits and applications for the public sector. Elsewhere, the London Stock Exchange Group partnered with IBM in July to trial a private platform for unlisted securities. The platform was designed to digitize both securities ownership and the capital structure of small to medium-sized enterprises.

coindesk	friends-dont-let-friends-bad-crypto	Friends Don't Let Friends Do Bad Crypto - CoinDesk	2017-11-17T11:30	Dan Elitzer is the blockchain and digital identity lead at IDEO CoLab, an R&D network that explores the impact of emerging tech through cross-industry collaborations. In this opinion piece, Elitzer explains why designing for security requires thinking about platforms beyond one's own. Recently I met with the founding team of a group building a project in the cryptocurrency space. They walked my IDEO CoLab colleagues and me through their web app, showing how users could buy and store bitcoin or ether in a custodial wallet, and then use those funds in a variety of ways. I noticed that they also had an option to enter a private key directly to make a transaction. RED ALERT! First rule of crypto: never, ever, EVER share your private key. Seriously. Just don't. (gif by IDEO CoLab) Corollary: Be extremely skeptical, if not outright suspicious, of any service or communication requesting your private key. Having met with this team previously and knowing their impressive backgrounds, I asked – relatively calmly – why they were asking for a private key. The chief technology officer explained that they were implementing a MyEtherWallet-style tool for signing transactions in the browser, so the private key would never be sent to their server. The intent was to allow users to easily use the service without having to let the platform take custody of funds, while also eliminating the friction associated with having to open up a separate wallet application to generate, sign, and broadcast a transaction. It removes a few steps – hooray for user experience – but does the shortcut really warrant the trade-offs? I'm very sympathetic to the view that UX in the crypto world is horrible and there's a need to get creative in exploring opportunities for simplification. And as the team pointed out, from a technical perspective, they would not be exposing users to any more risk than if those users entered their private keys on MyEtherWallet. That's true – they could implement the exact same open source code as MyEtherWallet. I trust that they would do this properly and I expect that some meaningful amount of their future users would be willing to trust them and feel secure entering private keys on this website. However, my concern is not primarily whether they could securely implement in-browser transaction signing; as I said, I trust both their competence and their intentions. What worries me more is that this gives the false impression, especially to those new to cryptocurrencies, that it is OK to enter your private key on a website. Basic information hygiene Most people are used to operating in the context where if a password is compromised, even for a bank account, usually the damage is at least somewhat reversible. Crypto is different: if you share your private keys, you lose everything. There is no recourse for getting back your stolen bitcoin, ether, or other tokens. A secure, trustworthy service requesting private keys normalizes the concept of users sharing private keys with services that they use. This is bad. Even if the company in question is trustworthy, it is a virtual guarantee that everyone buying, using, or participating in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in any way will at some point encounter a hacker or scammer trying to steal their money. Training users that a request to enter their private keys can be legitimate increases the likelihood that those users will fall victim to a scam in the future. An analog to this is when a traditional financial services company calls a customer about an issue and requests that the customer provide data like their account number, address, or last 4 digits of their Social Security nunber before proceeding. NO! Do not train your customers to share information or attempt to conduct any account-related interactions on a phone call that the customer did not initiate him or herself! (For anyone to whom this is news: please always, always, ALWAYS end such calls immediately and call back through a support line listed on the website of the company in question.) A high bar of trust During a deep conversation that revealed the team had given a lot of consideration to security and usability tradeoffs, the startup CEO asked, "Why is it okay for MyEtherWallet to ask users to enter their private keys or upload their keystore files, but not OK for us to do so?" That's a fair question. First, I would assume that the majority of people entering their private keys to use MyEtherWallet originally generated those private keys on MyEtherWallet with the intention of using them on MyEtherWallet in the future. If you already trusted a website or application to generate your keys, you're not greatly expanding your attack surface by continuing to trust them when you go to use those keys. Second, there's a special role that wallet software and services play in this ecosystem. They are the agent that mediates the user's interaction with the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and it is absolutely imperative that the user trusts that their wallet is presenting accurate information to them and is behaving in accordance with the user's intent. As such, there is an incredibly high bar of trust that wallet developers must achieve before knowledgeable cryptocurrency users will consider using them to manage their assets. If the cryptocurrency ecosystem is ever going to develop in such a way that tokens are useful for applications beyond just investment or speculation, we'll see hundreds, thousands, possibly even millions, of services built that include interactions where users need to generate signatures with their private keys. Expecting people to be able to discern whether they should trust a new service they encounter with their private keys is untenable. Beware impostors One suggestion a colleague of mine had was for MyEtherWallet (or another highly trusted service) to create a transaction-signing widget that could be embedded in other sites, so users could be confident entering their private keys. The startup CEO even suggested that the company might even create such a tool itself and publish it for others to use. While I applaud the sentiment of building something useful and sharing it with others, the problem is not one that can be solved in this way. Let's say MyEtherWallet did create a branded transaction-signing widget. How would visitors to a site with the widget embedded know that it was a genuine MyEtherWallet widget rather than a lookalike that would steal their private keys? "They can just do a checksum." Well, to trust that a checksum is valid, the user would need to first know what a checksum is, then run it themselves. Any visual cue as to the validity of the widget or checksum could easily be faked. Unless and until it becomes reasonable to assume that an overwhelming majority of users have their own agent software automatically verifying signatures and running checksum functions, using easily faked visual cues to signify security will only increase the vulnerability of your users. We're all in this together It turns out that this wonderful, trustless future that so many of us are striving to create isn't actually so trustless. In fact, it's not even trust-minimized. It's trust-specified: we need to be very specific about who we are trusting for what tasks. It's incumbent on all participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem to help users develop an understanding and intuition for this by only asking users for the bare minimum amount of trust and permissions that we need and pointing them to reputable services who follow best practices in security and disclosure for all other functions.

coindesk	giant-ntt-data-enlists-13-companies-blockchain-consortium	IT Giant NTT Data Enlists 13 Companies for Blockchain Consortium - CoinDesk	2017-08-16T12:00	Japan's largest IT services firm, NTT Data, has announced a new consortium aimed to investigate use cases for blockchain technology. According to the company, the initiative so far includes 13 different companies drawn from the financial, logistical and trade industries. Notable participants include Mizuho Financial Group, Mitsu Sumitomo Insurance, Nippon Express and Sojitz Corporation. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Toyota Tsusho and Kawasaki Kisen Corporation, and others, are also involved. The effort, which will officially launch on August 30, is expected to run through next spring. Perhaps informing the new group effort, NTT Data is no stranger to blockchain. The IT giant has already completed work on pilot programs for banks looking to test the issuance of letters of credit through blockchain, as well as partnering with insurance companies to explore the technology. The announcement comes during a period of building momentum for blockchain development in Japan, which has even seen government agencies test the use of smart contracts. More recently, a group of Japanese financial institutions successfully tested a prototype that uses distributed ledger technology to streamline international transaction agreements.

coindesk	global-securities-watchdog-warns-investors-on-ico-risks	Global Securities Watchdog Warns Investors on ICO Risks - CoinDesk	2018-01-19T11:00	An organization comprised of global securities regulators has issued a notice today alerting investors to the perceived risks associated with initial coin offerings (ICOs). The group, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), warned that, since cryptocurrencies can operate freely across borders, these "highly speculative investments" are attracting participation from retail investors based in different countries. In the event of a potential scam or fraud, token sale projects may be out of the jurisdiction of the investor's country of residence. As such, the organization advises investors to be "very careful" before investing in ICOs. The notice is just the latest case in which financial regulators from around the world have been actively monitoring the development of either individual token sales or ICO activity as a whole. Over the last year, multiple countries had made notable moves on regulating ICOs. While China and South Korea formally banned such activities, other places like the U.S., the U.K. and recently Malaysia, are also increasing scrutiny over token issuances that may be defined as securities. As detailed by IOSCO in its website, so far financial watchdogs from at least 26 countries have issued warnings on ICO risks. Based in Madrid, Spain, IOSCO consists of top financial watchdogs from over 100 countries around the world. Notable members include the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and European Securities and Markets Authority.

coindesk	googles-doubleclick-ads-used-distribute-crypto-mining-malware	Google's DoubleClick Ads Used to Distribute Crypto Mining Malware - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T22:20	Security firm TrendMicro stated in a new report that Google's DoubleClick ad services were used to distribute cryptocurrency mining malware to a number of users in Europe and Asia. On its Security and Intelligence Blog, the company outlined how CoinHive – a JavaScript program that works in the background of a website and uses a computer's processing power to mine monero – was distributed by attackers who appropriated Google's DoubleClick. Significantly, miners like CoinHive operate without a user's consent or knowledge. Google's DoubleClick ad services are also used by YouTube, the world's most popular video sharing service, and the miner impacted a number of users on the site, according to ArsTechnica. A "separate web miner that connects to a private pool" was also involved in the scheme, according to TrendMicro's report. The "malvertisement" incorporated two different web miner scripts in addition to the actual advertisement, according to the report. It continued: "The affected webpage will show the legitimate advertisement while the two web miners covertly perform their task. We speculate that the attackers’ use of these advertisements on legitimate websites is a ploy to target a larger number of users, in comparison to only that of compromised devices. The traffic involving the abovementioned cryptocurrency miners has since decreased after January 24". As much as 80 percent of an affected computer's processing power can be taken over when exposed, reducing the machine's performance, according to the report. Clandestine cryptocurrency mining has been on the rise in recent months, as previously reported. Companies such as oil pipeline giant Transneft have seen their systems affected by the malware, and a report from November suggested that CoinHive has become one of the more common pieces of malware in circulation today.

coindesk	haven-blockchain-case-wyoming	A Haven for Blockchain: The Case for Wyoming - CoinDesk	2018-01-27T12:31	Rep. Tyler Lindholm is a rancher in Sundance, Wyoming, and a Republican member of the Wyoming House of Representatives. Caitlin Long, a Wyoming native, is former chairman and president of Symbiont and a former managing director of Morgan Stanley. Wyoming is stepping up to welcome the blockchain community with open arms. A grassroots group, the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, has garnered significant momentum to pass a package of legislation that would bring significant benefits to both the blockchain community and the State of Wyoming. The package of blockchain bills, which will be introduced during the upcoming session in February, will build on two characteristics of Wyoming that make it particularly attractive to the blockchain industry: zero corporate income or franchise taxes, and strict privacy laws governing LLCs formed in the state. Companies don't need to move to Wyoming physically to take advantage, just as most Delaware corporations aren't located in Delaware. But but there are real reasons why businesses might want to move there. Cheyenne, the state capital, has tremendous fiber-optic bandwidth and cheap power that is already attracting major data centers to locate there, for example. And our initiative has active support by officials at the state’s only university. So Wyoming has “good bones” upon which to build a regulatory framework to attract the blockchain sector. Licensing exemptions The blockchain community is likely to be most excited by one of the bills just introduced, H.B.0070, which would exempt tokens issued on an open blockchain from Wyoming's money transmitter and securities laws, as long as the token has not been marketed as an investment and is exchangeable for goods or services. This bill would also exempt token exchanges (or people exchanging tokens) from being deemed broker/dealers under Wyoming law. The bill has garnered senior co-sponsors, including the Speaker of the House. As always, whether a token would be considered, under Wyoming law, either a security or exempt pursuant to the new legislation, would be a facts-and-circumstances analysis. Businesses should seek their own legal counsel. We view non-securities blockchain tokens as a new asset class that is neither money nor securities, and therefore believe existing money transmitter and securities regulations should not apply. In many cases, for example, such blockchain tokens are simply prepaid software licenses. If tradeable gift cards and prepaid cell phone minutes are not regulated as money or securities, why should prepaid software licenses fall into those categories? In many states, they do. In Wyoming, they should not, and we are optimistic that the legislature will agree. Wyoming's consumers will be protected by its strong anti-fraud and consumer protection laws, which we believe are sufficient to deter bad actors from doing business in the state. And businesses should analyze whether federal securities laws would still apply. Other measures The Wyoming Blockchain Coalition also supports two other bills as part of the package for the February session. The so-called "bitcoin bill," H.B.0019, proposes to exempt virtual currencies from Wyoming’s money transmitter laws. Alone, this legislation will allow businesses that pulled out of Wyoming in 2015, such as Coinbase, to operate in Wyoming. This will add a vital new industry to the State’s financial sector. It, too, has garnered many co-sponsors, including the President of the Senate. The third bill, the so-called "filings bill," would enable the Secretary of State to collect registrations on a blockchain, similar to that enacted by the State of Delaware last July. It would cover the filings made for corporations, LLCs and UCC financing statements. The goal of this legislation is to allow the official record of ownership and the official record of changes of ownership to exist on a blockchain. Eventually this will allow the State, counties, municipalities and businesses to eliminate paper trails such as deeds, titles and receipts. LLC City Wyoming led the way when it passed the nation's first LLC law in 1977, and it can again be first by offering the ability to register LLCs on a blockchain. This could attract meaningful business to register in Wyoming, as academic research shows that nearly two-thirds of new companies that register in the U.S. are LLCs. New types of LLC users, such as those seeking to limit liability for autonomous cars and other internet of things (IoT) devices, could be attracted to efficiencies enabled by blockchain-registered Wyoming LLCs. This is especially true for series LLCs, which is another initiative supported by the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition. LLCs are so popular in Wyoming today that there is almost one for every two citizens of the state. Wyoming can become a haven for the blockchain sector, building on its already-attractive attributes, if the package of blockchain bills are enacted. The bills provide tremendous benefits for blockchain businesses that either locate or register in Wyoming, as well as significant upside to the State. We welcome the blockchain community’s support in bringing these efforts to fruition. As we say in Wyoming, let 'er buck!

coindesk	heres-whats-standing-way-tokenized-economy	Here's What's Standing in the Way of a Tokenized Economy - CoinDesk	2017-11-25T11:00	Dr. Pavel Kravchenko holds a PhD in technical sciences and is the founder of Distributed Lab. In this opinion piece, the second of two parts, he describes the obstacles that must be overcome before blockchain technology can deliver on the promise of tokenization. In my previous post, I described the potential benefits of tokenizing assets. Right now there are two major problems standing in the way of this transformation. The first relates to the most obvious benefit: potential access to any asset for anyone in the world. From a regulatory compliance point of view, the ability for anyone to open an account and then buy or sell an asset is a mess. Let’s just take the example of EU banks that don't deal with U.S. persons. As soon as they accept them as customers, they have to comply with U.S. regulations (regardless of jurisdiction) and that could be very painful since the U.S. has real power to punish any deviation from their rules. Therefore, the risks from having a U.S. customer are much bigger than the profits from them. Obviously, the procedures for compliance and anti-money-laundering (AML) rules, and generally regulation on the whole, always depend on the specific jurisdiction, and may not necessarily meet the needs of the market. There are a few tendencies, however, that will eventually make it possible to trade securities (tokenized assets will be mainly considered securities) globally. Digital identity First, this thorny issue will be resolved by unification of AML and know-your-customer procedures and supported by market leaders, as, for example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Howey test has become the de facto standard for determining when a token is a security. Second, eventually developed countries will start using digital identities, as is necessary to automate KYC and AML procedures. The spread of digital identity solutions such as Estonia's e-residency is already underway and it will positively influence the opportunities for tokenization, because digital passports are also capable of signing transactions. As soon as digital identity is used, all document flows can also become digital, which will significantly simplify compliance procedures. Third, initiatives that create standards for information sharing and protection – such as BankID schemes in Sweden, Norway and the Ukraine and the EU’s PSD2 and GDPR regulations – amplify the need for changes at businesses. Organizations at the very heart of the financial world, the banks, governments, card payment networks, have already woken up and, understanding the potential of a global market, are ready to discard many of the intermediaries and regulations that surrounded them on all sides. We can see signs of movement towards that goal as banks are launching digital services, the European Commission is issuing directives to the financial sector based on the principle of open data and competition, and card networks are creating open APIs. In the meantime, the question of KYC in tokenization can be resolved by limiting the circle of investors or use cases for which all processes can be digitized – for example, keeping them in a sandbox environment. Standards missing The second obstacle to tokenization is the lack of infrastructure and some standardized approaches to tokenization. Very often people associate tokenization simply with the creation of a token on a public blockchain. But that’s just 10 percent of the whole process. A public or private blockchain in itself only provides the function of storing information about the asset, with limited capacity to carry out transactions. Any complete tokenization system will include: Managing the privileges of users and system administrators Life-cycle management of an asset (issuance, withdrawal from circulation, etc.) Security management Integration of KYC and AML systems Integration with payment gateways Managing trading commissions and limits Mobile and web apps Exchange modules or integration with external exchanges Moreover, there is a noticeable trend where each organization that manages assets seeks to create its own tokenization system, as in the case of real estate tokenization platforms that have been popping up. This makes sense, since it prevents centralization and allows different systems to compete for users. Hence, it is likely that in the future each organization will own its own system – just like now every company has its own accounting and reporting systems. For that reason, the development of across-the-board technical standards for the design and versioning of a system and the creation of all its components is a critical factor for integration into business. Properly documented technology makes it possible to use the same components of a platform repeatedly, increasing reliability and predictability, mitigating risks in development and integration, and most importantly, reducing the time to bring a product to market. Motivated to change The good news is that there's a strong impetus to build such linkages, even among incumbents that stand to be disrupted by a tokenized economy. Businesses will drive changes in regulation and infrastructure, voting with their money, and finally the community will move to resolve higher-order problems – such as the interaction of various ecosystems, demonstrable security, joint asset management, mathematically provable settlement and auditing, and much more. I strongly believe that tokenization will be the next big thing that will drive growth of world GDP and make entrepreneurs' lives easier. Everything that can be tokenized, will be tokenized.

coindesk	hhs-it-architect-talks-blockchain-white-paper-results	HHS Architect Talks Blockchain's Potential Role in Healthcare Administration - CoinDesk	2017-10-24T08:00	One of the figures behind the blockchain R&D effort within the US Health and Human Services (HHS) Department recently spoke out on the tech's potential in Medicare and other public-sector functions. Speaking with Federal News Radio last week, Debbie Bucci, a lead IT architect for the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), discussed the department's past call for academic papers, which saw more than 70 submissions from a range of sources. She remarked that many of the submissions focused in some way on healthcare administration Among the possible applications she discussed is using the tech as a publicly viewable layer for U.S. citizens to follow the status of their payments within programs like Medicare or Medicaid. "For Medicare, Medicaid, maybe the amount you're paying for – I know that for some processes people go in every quarter and they check their payment status, and so it's possible there could be a public ledger that authoritative sources may post to that everyone could collectively use as [a reference] for identifying information and possibly processing the calculations to get there," she told the radio service. Elsewhere in the interview, Bucci highlighted the technology's possible benefits for record-keeping purposes, telling the Federal News: "The general idea of a blockchain is an authoritative ledger, so certainly anything you want to keep records of – I think it kind of aligns with more of the business processes to assist with healthcare." Similarly, she indicated, blockchains can be used as a more efficient method of tracking payments made into and out of both systems, either by storing that information on a public ledger, or holding some information and allowing subscribers to calculate their specific costs and benefits more easily. The department has not yet pursued any particular blockchain research project, she clarified. At the same time, HHS is staying engaged with the developer community, and Bucci described a recent hackathon at which the winning project focused on the use of blockchain for tracking clinical trial data.

According to a document issued to inform to the government of British Columbia, IBM is touting the use of blockchain in order to ensure consumer safety and to include regulatory oversight in the legal distribution of cannabis "from seed to sale." The feedback was issued as the Canadian province prepares a regulatory framework for a legalized cannabis industry. According to official statements, the province plans to make non-medical cannabis legal by July 2018. Describing the technology's key features, including its transparency and immutability, IBM noted that blockchain would assure the health and safety of consumers through "provenance and traceability" of products throughout the cannabis supply chain, thus eliminating fraud. The document added: "[Blockchain's] relevance to regulating cannabis is similar to its many chain of custody applications in areas such as pharmaceutical distribution and food chains." On a concluding note, IBM stated that blockchain could help the provincial government "take control" of product sourcing and sales, thus helping eliminate black market sales "completely." IBM has been revealed various blockchain supply chain trials in recent months, including one with Singapore's port operator to automate the flow of documents between trading partners.

coindesk	ice-exploiting-blockchain-to-expose-crypto-use-in-drug-trafficking	ICE Exploiting Blockchain to Expose Crypto Use in Drug Trafficking - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T10:00	The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has detailed how it is working to expose transactions made by illegal drug traffickers using cryptocurrencies to cover their trail. In a written testimony to a Senate committee on Jan. 25, ICE's deputy assistant director Greg Nevano said the agency has seen increasing usage of cryptocurrencies to pay for the trafficking of illicit drug such as opioids like fentanyl. Combatting this growing concern, the agency said it has adopted various strategies to expose drug traders who are turning to cryptocurrencies for their difficulty to trace. Nevano wrote in his testimony: "In support of its diverse financial investigative efforts ICE uses undercover techniques to infiltrate and exploit peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchangers who typically launder proceeds for criminal networks engaged in or supporting dark net marketplaces." In addition, Nevano also indicated that ICE is employing "complex blockchain technology exploitation tools" in a bid to analyze cryptocurrency transactions and to discover the identities behind those transactions. Further, training is being provided by the agency to national and international cryptocurrency investigators to continue tackling the issue. While he did not disclose the precise details of the agency's cryptocurrency investigations, the comments mark ICE's latest effort in delving into cryptocurrency's underlying blockchain technology in order to strip its core feature of anonymity. As reported by CoinDesk previously, in another testimony to a Senate committee, ICE reported its concern that criminal organizations have been increasingly using cryptocurrencies to launder money or pay for illicit activities.

coindesk	indian-bitcoin-exchanges-seek-clarification-over-tax-liabilities	Indian Bitcoin Exchanges Seek Clarification Over Tax Liabilities - CoinDesk	2018-01-05T12:51	Indian bitcoin exchanges are raising questions over the applicability of goods and service tax (GST) to their operations. Seven bitcoin exchanges in the nation including Unocoin, Zebpay and CoinSecure are seeking clarity over how their businesses might be classified under GST rules, and are planning to approach the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) – the government body that decides on the applicability of tax rates – over the matter, the Economic Times (ET) states. An official familiar with the matter told the news source that at least one bitcoin exchange has already filed an application with the Maharashtra state AAR to clarify ambiguities over its tax liability. The official said: "The tax department is currently researching the concept as bitcoins are a very complex subject." Under the GST rules, if bitcoin is considered to be a currency, there would not be any taxes applicable, ET states. However, if it is recognized instead as a good, GST at 18 percent could be applicable, or, in the case of it being deemed a service, 12 percent. Abhishek A Rastogi, a partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, told ET that there is ambiguity for bitcoin exchanges over whether GST is applicable on total revenue or merely on margins earned. He continued to say, "the tax authority must give clarity on whether bitcoin exchanges are selling goods and services, or are mere trading platforms that earn margins." The move comes a month after the Indian tax department visited bitcoin exchanges across the country seeking to identify users. The operation was carried out over suspicions of tax evasion by some exchange customers.

coindesk	indias-tax-department-collects-user-data-at-multiple-bitcoin-exchanges	India's Tax Department Collects User Data at Multiple Bitcoin Exchanges - CoinDesk	2017-12-14T10:00	The Indian Income Tax Department has visited bitcoin exchanges across the country seeking to identify users. The widespread operation is being carried out over suspicions of tax evasion by exchange customers, the Press Trust of India states. The agency visited nine cryptocurrency exchanges in cities including Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi. According to tax department officials, the surveys – conducted under section 133A of the Indian Income Tax Act – were performed in order to collect the identities of digital currency investors, their transactions, the bank accounts used, emails, and other data. The survey teams were reportedly armed with an assortment of software tools to capture exchange data, including "cloning and mirror imaging," and identified the accounts of a number of high-net-worth individuals. A senior official at the department was cited as saying: "Out of these, about 8-10 lakh [800,000-1,000,000] entities would be active for transactions. However, the operations are still on and final findings will emerge later." The department said that it is also seeking cases where large amounts of "black money" had been laundered using bitcoin during the country's demonetization process in November 2016. With the recent spike in the bitcoin prices, the country's central bank – the Reserve Bank of India – set the alarm bells ringing a week ago, cautioning "users, holders and traders" of cryptocurrencies over the perceived risks of involvement. The country's finance minister, Arun Jaitley, also recently clarified that the government does not recognize bitcoin as legal tender, adding that financial sector watchdogs and the government are working on "recommendations" to regulate the cryptocurrency. "The government's position is clear, we don't recognize this as legal currency as of now," he said at the time.

coindesk	indonesias-central-bank-cryptocurrency-payments-not-legitimate	Indonesia Central Bank: Cryptocurrency Payments 'Not Legitimate' - CoinDesk	2018-01-15T10:00	Bank Indonesia has warned that cryptocurrencies may not be used for payments in the country. The central bank published a press release on Saturday, stating that cryptocurrencies are not a "legitimate instrument of payment" in the country, as they do not comply with the 2011 currency act and are not issued by the Republic of Indonesia. "Financial transactions conducted within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, has to be fulfilled with Rupiah," the currency act states. As a result, the central bank said that payment firms are not allowed to make virtual currency transactions. The central bank states: "Bank Indonesia affirms that it forbids all payment system operator (principal, switching operator, clearing operator, final settlement operator, issuer, acquirer, payment gateway operator, electronic wallet operator, money transfer operator) and financial technology operators in Indonesia, both bank and non-bank institution, to process transactions using virtual currency, as stated in Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 18/40/PBI/2016 on Implementation of Payment Transaction Processing and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 19/12/PBI/2017 on Implementation of Financial Technology." The warning makes no mention of cryptocurrency exchanges. The news comes after the central bank revealed in early December 2017 that it was considering new regulations that would outlaw bitcoin transactions from 2018. On the 20th of the same month, the bank issued a new regulation – No. 19/12/PBI/2017 on Implementation of Financial Technology – due to concerns over bitcoin's potential use in terrorism financing, money laundering and drug trafficking. In its latest warning, Bank Indonesia also warned "all parties" that buying, selling or trading cryptocurrencies come with "high risks," as they are "highly volatile" and do not have backing from an authority, or underlying assets to support prices. The note reads: "This means that virtual currencies are vulnerable to bubble risks, and susceptible to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing, therefore can potentially impact financial system stability and cause financial harm to society." With the new notice, Bank Indonesia joins a number of global central banks in issuing warnings as the prices of cryptocurrencies have soared amid what many in traditional finance have labelled a bubble. Countries including the U.K., India, Russia and more have recently cautioned investors and traders over the perceived risks involved in cryptocurrencies.

coindesk	investors-file-class-action-against-bitconnect-following-abrupt-closure	Investors File Class Action Against BitConnect After Closure - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T09:15	Just a week after the abrupt closure of BitConnect's lending and exchange platform, investors are seeking legal action to claim back their funds, according to public document. The class action case (see below), filed with the Southern District Court of Florida on Jan. 24, alleges that BitConnect issued cryptocurrency tokens that were effectively unregistered securities and gathered additional funds as a "wide-ranging Ponzi scheme." The lawsuit was filed by David Silver from the Florida-based law firm Silver Miller, which has filed suits on behalf of cryptocurrency consumers including those seeking damages against mining company Giga Watt. In light of the recent closure of BitConnect after receiving two cease-and-desist orders by U.S. state regulators, the plaintiffs are seeking to claim back the investments they put into the company. The document states that BitConnect launched several projects, such as a lending program that required investors to send in cryptocurrencies to purchase BitConnect Coin, a token generated by the company's platform. BitConnect then allegedly promised investors that its proprietary trading platform would use the funds to generate a monthly return of 40 percent or a daily compound rate at 1 percent, which could amount to 3,000 percent annually. As such, the plaintiffs argue that BitConnect violated the Securities Act by issuing unregistered securities. The document further points to a statement claimed to be taken from BitConnect's website: "This investment option involves profiting from BitConnect trading bot and volatility software. You will receive daily profit based on your investment options. Upon investment term completion, you will receive your capital back to take out from the BitConnect lending platform or optionally reinvest back in lending platform to continue receiving daily profits." Yet the plaintiffs further allege that, instead of genuinely using the funds for cryptocurrency trading, BitConnect operated as a Ponzi scheme and took funds from additional investors to realize the promise for existing investors. According to the document, six individuals filed the case on behalf of all investors and account holders who have transferred funds – both cryptocurrencies and fiat – to BitConnect for investment. While it's unclear based on the document how much in assets the whole class put in, the six named individuals said their loss totaled $771,000. As reported previously, BitConnect's closure came after two cease-and-desist orders from the Texas and North Carolina securities regulators, which subsequently led to a 90 percent plunge in the price of its BitConnect Coin, which is traded on several cryptocurrency exchanges. At press time, BitConnect had not responded to a CoinDesk email request for comment.

coindesk	israels-ico-tax-plan-retain-startups-scare-off	Would Israel's ICO Tax Plan Retain Startups or Scare Them Off? - CoinDesk	2018-01-24T09:00	There's a handful of initial coin offering (ICO) issuers working out of Tel Aviv, Israel, but they typically domicile elsewhere. That's not particularly helpful for the government since it loses out, not only on tax revenue, but also opportunities to market Israel as a place to do business. And according to some, the Israel Tax Authority's (ITA) draft circular, published last week, detailing how domestic companies' ICO revenue could be taxed, is an effort by the Israeli government to entice token issuers to stay on the Middle Eastern soil. "Up until now all Israeli ICOs ran the ICO from either Switzerland or Gibraltar," said Uriel Peled, a co-founder of two Israeli crypto startups. Both countries are known as business-friendly tax havens. In Peled's eyes, the ITA is taking steps to legitimize the business of companies financed by ICOs, in an effort to make the country just as attractive. (The ITA did not respond to request for comment from CoinDesk delivered through a third party.) CoinDash, Matchpool and Kik, all of whose teams fully or partly work in Israel, have moved their bases outside the country. Plus, Sirin Labs, which raised $157 million in an ICO recently, is largely based in Tel Aviv, but its website shows a company address in Switzerland. One of the main reasons the ITA's circular might be appealing to token issuers is that it describes deferrals on when ICO income would become taxable, plus it mentions the potential for crypto companies to earn special tax treatment. As such, according to Peled, the industry will see more companies officially operating from Israel this year, although he declined to give any specific names. One of his startups, a consultancy called CoinTree, is encouraging clients to consider an Israeli address. Pointing to what he sees as an advantage to working in a country that is trying to move cryptocurrency out of a gray area, Peled told CoinDesk: "The goal of the blockchain industry in Israel is not to stay under the radar. It’s always been clear to us that there will be regulations and we want to work with government to help create regulations that are good for both sides." Realizing the magnitude Global consulting giant Deloitte helped the ITA craft the circular, providing extensive feedback by invitation, according to Yitzchak Chikorel of Deloitte's international taxation team. Chikorel and others were able to convince the authority that drawing distinctions between different crypto tokens – whether it be the original currency tokens, such as bitcoin; crypto tokens created to fund the building of a platform that the coins will be used to access in the future; or crypto tokens that act as equity – would be key to writing successful regulation. "The main focus is the utility coins which are also in the heart of the tax circular," Chikorel told CoinDesk. "Our main focus was to tie a direct and clear line between the technology to the tokens, arguing they are connected one to each other in an inseparable tie." Plus, the circular makes it clear that income will not automatically be taxed when it is first received. Chikorel likened this to a gift card purchase – in many places around the world, income from a gift card purchase doesn't become taxable until someone spends the amount on the gift card, and the company can actually determine how much profit it realized. Similarly, as people start to spend the tokens bought in an ICO to purchase items on a new platform, the company will then calculate how much profit it made after it built the software and acquired customers. The circular also acknowledges that blockchain-based companies could apply for further tax advantages under Israel's Encouragement of Capital Investment Law, which was broadly designed to attract and retain high-tech companies. Chikorel said he's pretty confident such applications would be accepted, telling CoinDesk: "The ITA has realized the magnitude and the importance of the blockchain as an evolutionary technology that could allow the creation of the next generation of multinational companies." Keeping them away Having said that, others aren't so sure that tax laws will persuade Israeli companies to bring their ICO income home. First of all, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, mirroring some of the anti-establishment sentiment of the industry as a whole, have not typically viewed regulatory actions as comforting, even though many say these kinds of moves legitimize the industry. "Currently, I'm unaware of any Israeli company who did, or plans to do, an ICO under Israeli jurisdiction," said Lior Jaffe, co-founder of Jelurida, the Israeli startup behind blockchain platforms Nxt and Ardor. "And these regulations, if accepted, pretty much ensure that this will stay this way." Secondly, taxes are just part of the regulatory landscape, and the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), which regulates securities in the country, has yet to formally rule on how ICO tokens should be categorized. However, in September, it established a committee to look into the actions taken by other securities regulators around the world and decide on whether it should consider ICOs part of its purview. Not many countries' securities regulators have set hard-and-fast definitions for ICO tokens. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman has stated that most projects he's reviewed appear to be securities, and has moved to prosecute several ICO founders. Russia has been more decisive and China outright banned ICOs. Possibly hinting at tighter rules, the head of the ISA, Shmuel Hauser, said the regulator will seek to ban any company that has major involvement in bitcoin trading from listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). Yet, as a small country lacking a global financial hub (like London or New York), Jaffe argued, Israel should go out of its way to keep its domestic high-tech companies local. "The only practical way to achieve this is to announce that all revenues from ICOs are considered an investment and therefore exempt from taxes for a period of several years," he contended, adding: "I think the state of Israeli is missing out on a huge opportunity to become a crypto-friendly jurisdiction."

coindesk	jamie-dimon-says-he-regrets-calling-bitcoin-a-fraud	Jamie Dimon Regrets Calling Bitcoin a Fraud - CoinDesk	2018-01-09T14:40	JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon now reportedly regrets calling bitcoin a "fraud," though he is still not a fan of the cryptocurrency. In an interview with FOX Business Tuesday, Dimon said: "The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people. I'm not interested that much in the subject at all." Dimon made the fraud comment on Sep. 12 of last year, adding that he would fire any trader known to be trading the cryptocurrency. Offering a critique of Dimon's opinion at the time, a senior analyst for Macquarie Group pushed back against some of the criticism against bitcoin coming from Wall Street. Viktor Shvets, head of global and Asia-Pacific equity strategy for Macquarie, wrote in September that in spite of any "extreme speculation," bitcoin relies on a "durable technology that is likely to continue to evolve and strengthen." In October, Dimon said he was done talking about bitcoin following his controversial comment. Yet, soon after he opined that bitcoin buyers will " pay the price " if they are "stupid enough to buy it." While Dimon is still not interested in the subject of bitcoin, he had praise for blockchain technology. The CEO told Fox Business today, "The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO's you have to look at individually."

coindesk	japanese-electronics-retailer-launches-bitcoin-payments	Japanese Electronics Retail Giant Launches Bitcoin Payments - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T12:15	Major Japanese consumer electronics retailer Yamada Denki has partnered with cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer to add a bitcoin payments service in two of its stores. Launched this weekend, according to a press release, one of the stores to receive the new service is based in Shinjuku, an area of Tokyo that attracts large numbers of foreign visitors. The other store is adjacent to Tokyo's main business district. The company said: "In addition to diversifying [our services], we will implement initiatives to improve bitcoin recognition and usage promotion." With the launch of the bitcoin payment system, the company indicated it aims to respond to the diverse needs of its customers both in Japan and overseas. "We believe that we can provide improved service and convenience," it said. Yamada Denki has set the settlement limit of bitcoins equivalent to 300,000 Japanese yen ($2,760) per account. Bitcoin is trading around $11,200 (1,218,016 JPY) at the time of writing, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. The moves comes after another Japanese electronics retailer, Bic Camera, said last April that it will test a new point-of-sale system (PoS) that will allow customers to purchase goods with bitcoin, also in partnership with with bitFlyer. Later in July, the firm said that it is expanding a bitcoin payment option to all of its stores nationwide. And, in August, Tokyo-based Marui, a department store chain, tested bitcoin payments at one of its locations in Shinjuku. The trial set a cap of ¥100,000 (about $900) on bitcoin transactions.

coindesk	japanese-shipping-giant-ibm-to-trial-blockchain-in-cross-border-trade	Japanese Shipping Giant, IBM to Trial Blockchain in Cross-Border Trade - CoinDesk	2017-12-14T11:00	Japanese shipping firm Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and partners including IBM are to undertake a blockchain proof-of-concept looking to streamline international trade flows. According to the company's statement, the "demonstration test" will see real-time trade transactions made using a blockchain -based application. The project will see trade agreements, logistics and insurance documents, and more, digitized, stored and shared among participants, bringing a number of benefits over traditional trade systems. MOL states: "The test is intended to verify the effectiveness of blockchain for enhancing security and reducing the time required to settle cross-border trade transactions, discrepancies among related documents and administrative costs." Aiming to increase competitiveness and develop new products via the technology, joining MOL on the project are IBM Japan, the Japan Research Institute, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and other arms of the Mitsui Group. The proof-of-concept will utilize the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework, developed by the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain consortium. SMFG was recently revealed to be among a group of Japanese financial institutions that successfully tested a prototype using distributed ledger technology (DLT) to streamline international transaction agreements. That work used DLT startup consortium R3's Corda software to streamline an ISDA Master Agreement negotiation. In September, a joint venture between shipping giant Maersk, Microsoft and accounting firm EY was announced, having the aim of applying blockchain technology in the field of marine insurance. Built using Microsoft Azure, the effort will to create a shared database that logs information about shipments, as well as potential risks, in order to help companies comply with insurance regulations.

coindesk	jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-and-more-complete-equity-swaps-dlt-pilot	JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Trial DLT for Equity Swaps - CoinDesk	2017-11-20T16:05	A group of major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs has trialed the exchange of equity swaps over a distributed ledger (DLT) system. Using the AxCore distributed ledger platform from startup Axoni, the pilot – which also included BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and Citi – saw the banks process equity swaps from start to finish, according to an announcement from today. The trial looked at the potential of DLT to streamline the way swaps are made. By carrying out trades across a network where all parties use the same valuation data and share the same books, in theory, payments can be processed nearly instantaneously and disputes over transactions will be less likely. Greg Schvey, CEO of Axoni, said in a statement: "Equity swap data is infamously complex and difficult to manage, making it a terrific fit for distributed ledger technology." Following on from a proof-of-concept from late last year, the pilot tested tasks like trade creation, amendments, swap aging and dividends. The pilot also tested factors external to the trades, such as network performance and privacy, although it was conducted entirely a test environment. None of the trades were real and no money changed hands, according to Bloomberg. Axoni used a standardized data structure for the swaps, built in collaboration with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). The collaborators also put together a governance framework to be used on a production network. In May, Axoni closed a $20 million Series A round that saw participation from banks such as Citi and investors like Andreessen-Horowitz. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Axoni.

coindesk	kansas-latest-us-state-to-warn-on-crypto-investment-risk	Kansas Latest US State to Warn on Crypto Investment Risk - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T13:30	The securities commissioner of the U.S. state of Kansas has issued a warning on the risks of cryptocurrency and ICO investments. On Jan. 25, the Office of Securities Commissioner – a division of the Kansas Insurance Department – issued a statement to the public that investment in cryptocurrencies, including initial coin offerings (ICOs) and futures tied to digital currencies, are not insured by the government. As such, the commissioner warns investors to be cautious regarding investment pitfalls. John Wine, the state's securities commissioner, said: "Investors should go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, as well as cryptocurrency futures contracts and other financial products where these virtual currencies are linked in some way to the underlying investment." In addition, the State Insurance Department highlights that projects that give promises of high return, make unsolicited offers or pressure investors, are "red flags" of fraudulent schemes that investors should be aware of. The statement, although not entirely surprising, once more signals that regulators in the U.S., at both state and federal levels, are paying closer attention to cryptocurrency activities, especially those that may be considered as issuing securities under disguise of token sales. Just last week, the chiefs of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity and Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) said through an op-ed article that federal regulators are increasing their resources and efforts in scrutinizing cryptocurrencies. At law enforcement level, in addition to three recent lawsuits brought by the CFTC against cryptocurrency operators, state level government bodies such as Texas State Securities Board and Department of Banking have recently given cease-and-desist orders to initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency banking services, citing the violation of financial regulations.

coindesk	kaspersky-labs-reveal-increase-mining-botnet-usage	1.6 Million Attacks: Kaspersky Reveals Data on Crypto Mining Malware - CoinDesk	2017-09-13T20:30	More than 1.65 million computers were targeted by cryptocurrency mining malware attacks in the first eight months of 2017, according to a new report from Kaspersky Lab. The Russia-based cybersecurity outfit said on Tuesday that the figure represents the number of computers, running Kaspersky software, that were protected from the malicious software, which can turn a machine into a remotely-controlled mining device without the owner actually knowing. The total for 2017 thus far seems on pace to exceed the number of attacks detected in 2016, which totaled 1.8 million. By comparison, Kaspersky detected just over 700,000 mining malware attacks in 2014. Partially underpinning the incidents, the company said, are several large-scale botnets dedicated to malicious mining activities. The report said: "This results in threat actors receiving cryptocurrency, while their victims’ computer systems experience a dramatic slowdown. Over the last month alone, we have detected several large botnets designed to profit from concealed crypto mining." The company only released the number of its own clients protected, and did not clarify how many machines they thought were infected globally, or if any of their customers were infected despite their protection. Cryptocurrency mining botnets are nothing new. One of the newer botnets discovered in 2017 was developed out of a US National Security Agency exploit leaked by a group of hackers referred to as the Shadow Brokers. Though miners traditionally infected Windows computers, they can also impact Linux machines. Some botnets infect machines which do not possess sufficient processing power to effectively mine for anything as well.

coindesk	korean-crypto-exchange-korbit-halting-deposits-from-non-citizens	Korean Crypto Exchange Korbit Halting Deposits from Non-Citizens - CoinDesk	2018-01-22T11:10	South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit has barred non-citizens from depositing local currency – the Korean won – on its platform. Korbit stated in an announcement that its virtual account service will be terminated this month in order to introduce accounts attached to users' identities, as recently ordered by local regulators in a move aimed to calm speculation in the crypto markets, as well as money laundering. As part of that shift, foreign nationals will no longer be able to deposit funds to their accounts. The firm said: "If you are not a Korean citizen, the KRW deposit to the domestic virtual currency exchange will be stopped when you switch to the new KRW deposit method in January. [This] applies to both domestic residents and non-residents." Korbit added that foreigners will not be allowed to deposit Korean won "at any domestic cryptocurrency exchanges" when the new system is implemented. According to reports, the government has previously indicated it would ban non-resident foreigners and minors from trading cryptocurrencies. Early this month, South Korea announced it would begin implementing the new regulations banning anonymous cryptocurrency exchange accounts on or around Jan. 20. The proposal essentially strengthens know-your-customer (KYC) rules already in existence for exchanges and banks, and will require cryptocurrency exchange users to connect a bank account with identifying information in order to deposit or withdraw funds. Last week, local financial authorities stated that cryptocurrency investors would face fines if they did not switch their virtual accounts to ones with identities attached.

coindesk	korean-regulator-fines-crypto-exchanges-over-privacy-failures	South Korea Fines Crypto Exchanges for Privacy Failures - CoinDesk	2018-01-24T10:00	The South Korea government has today issued fines totaling 141 million won ($130,000) to domestic cryptocurrency exchanges for providing insufficient user data protection. In a public announcement, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said the penalty is a result of an investigation that the agency conducted from Oct. 10 to Dec. 28 in 2017 across 10 domestic crypto exchanges. Launched as a ministry-level agency, KCC is responsible for regulating the broadcasting and telecommunications sector, as well citizen's information protection. Among the 10 surveyed companies, eight were found to be violating the Information and Communication Network Act, which mandates user privacy protection methods, according to the announcement. The eight penalized companies are: Upbit, Ripple4y, Coinpia, Youbit, Korbit, Coinone and Coinplug, as well as Eyalabs, a cryptocurrency wallet service. According to the agency, the individual fines range from $9,000 to $14,000. The announcement details that critical violations include some exchanges failing to delete users' data even when they had stopped using the service for over a year, and some others storing users' data outside of the country. KCC chairman Lee Hyo-Sung said: "While the security threats such as virtual currency speculation and hacking of handling sites are increasing, the actual situation of personal information protection of major virtual currency exchanges is very weak. Therefore, we will try to reduce the damage of users through more strict sanctions." The KCC subsequently required these exchanges to take actions in resolving the issue within 30 days and file reports to the agency. In addition, the regulator said it will draw up and implement plans pertaining to managing cryptocurrency wallets, private keys and cryptocurrency transactions to serve as administrative guidance for exchanges. While the amount of the individual fines may not be significant, the move arrives just a day after the country's financial watchdog set a date for the formal cessation of anonymous cryptocurrency trading, yet another signal of the effort underway by the country's authorities to increase regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges.

coindesk	latest-zcash-ceremony-took-chernobyl-nuclear-waste-to-3000-feet	Latest Zcash Ceremony Used Chernobyl Waste - CoinDesk	2018-01-28T11:21	Developers working on the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash have employed nuclear waste from Chernobyl in the network's latest secrecy-assuring ceremony. The devs, Ryan Pierce and Andrew Miller, held their latest "Powers of Tau" ceremony last weekend, and notably used the nuclear waste to generate random numbers. Miller said: "Powers of Tau is all about generating and safely disposing of cryptographic 'toxic waste.' So, what better way to generate entropy than with actual radioactive toxic waste?" To ensure the event's privacy, it took place at 3,000 feet above sea level on a small private aircraft in the airspace above Illinois and Wisconsin, wrote Miller on a mailing list when describing the procedure. Miller said a radioactive graphite moderator acted as the source for low-level gamma and beta radiation. The graphite was sourced from the core of the Chernobyl nuclear facility, which suffered a catastrophic meltdown in 1986. A Geiger tube connected to a number generator converted radioactive pulses into digits, which were then incorporated into the code. "The entropy source was a hardware-based random number generator utilizing a Geiger tube and a radioactive source, constructed and programmed by Ryan Pierce," Miller said. The graphite emitted very low levels of radiation, "falling substantially below all thresholds that might restrict its transportation by air, and posting no health risk," according to Miller. In fact, the amount of radiation emitted is only a few times the level of background radiation that people receive on Earth, Pierce said in a video describing the experiment. During the ceremony, the developers take extreme measures to ensure malicious actors cannot possibly compromise the code during the process – the reason, in this case, for the aircraft flight. Further, to ensure the radioactive source was producing genuinely random pulses, Pierce and Miller attached a battery to their data collector to compare. These measures also extend to destroying all the computers used to build the code – or at least the parts of the software the developers utilize for the process. The result is, in theory, a completely random, private piece of code with which to build zcash.

coindesk	ledger-blue-hardware-wallet-blockchain-smart-contracts	Ledger Launches Blockchain Wallet for Smart Contract Era	2016-11-26T14:45	Ledger, the French company known for its range of bitcoin hardware wallets, has launched a new extension of its product line: the Ledger Blue. Billed as "the most advanced hardware wallet on the market today", the Ledger Blue is a significant departure from the thumbdrive style of Ledger's previous products. With a 320 x 480 pixel screen (along with BlueTooth and near-field communication (NFC) capability), it's a handheld touchscreen device that can run a number of different applications. In a video call, Ledger CEO Eric Larchevêque talked to CoinDesk about the product’s evolution, design philosophy and target market. Support for smart contracts Ledger launched its first product, the Ledger Nano, in December 2014, marketed at the time as a small, secure and low-cost hardware wallet. Then, earlier this year, the Nano S was released – a line extension that included both a small LED screen and support for other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and litecoin. (Ultimately, it was hailed as a more affordable competitor to the popular Trezor wallet). The launch of the Blue now comes as as a response to the increasingly complex needs of an ecosystem that now includes smart contracts, token exchanges and other types of asset trading – creating a situation where transactions and contracts can involve multiple parties and variables, each of which the signatory needs to verify. “Say you want to develop smart contracts on ethereum, at the moment it's hard to validate everything on a small screen,” said Larchevêque. “But the Ledger Blue allows you to build your own application to validate a specific smart contract." The amount of screen real estate means that an application can present multiple data fields for inspection before the final confirmation is given, an essential step when a contract will then automatically execute itself. "With the blockchain, so much of the security relies on the endpoint – that's why it's really important to know that what you see is what you sign," Larchevêque said. The Blue also includes support for a range of cryptocurrencies: the device’s technical spec currently lists bitcoin, ethereum, Zcash, Dash and Monero, along with the ability to integrate with other wallet providers like Electrum and Mycelium. According to Ledger’s description of its custom-built Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System, these different currency handling applications are run in isolation from each other and cannot access memory or storage used by another, meaning that cryptographic secrets should remain safe even if one application is compromised. Tech-savvy targeted The Ledger Blue is also built with open-source principles in mind both for software and hardware design. Whereas most smart devices ship with completely sealed enclosures, the Blue's case is held in place magnetically and can be detached. In a video demonstration, Larchevêque showed the case quickly separating and reattaching to reveal the components inside, a design choice which reflects the assumption that this is a product geared toward technically skilled end users. "We already know that crypto asset enthusiasts want to have a powerful, best-in-class hardware wallet. But the new customers we want to reach with this product are enterprise customers … who are already starting to build solutions on the blockchain using our products," Larchevêque said. Some enterprise clients that have already signed up include Monax and Stratumn, two enterprise blockchain platforms which will use the Blue as a hardware endpoint for their services. With its enterprise SDK included with the product, Ledger is also hoping to attract developers to the platform. The product, priced at €229 before VAT, is decidedly high-end, but looks to offer a vastly different user experience to anything currently on the market. Once the first units reach consumers, we'll no doubt be hearing a range of feedback on how it compares. The Ledger Blue is available for pre-order today, with devices expected to ship by December 18th. Customers can get 20% off for Black Friday weekend only with promo code BBF21.

coindesk	ledger-to-ledger-hardware-wallet-integrates-with-decentralized-exchange	Ledger-to-Ledger? Hardware Wallet Integrates with Decentralized Exchange - CoinDesk	2018-01-18T17:40	Decentralized exchange startup Radar Relay has announced that it has added support for the Ledger hardware wallet. In a post published Wednesday, the Øx order book provider announced the integration with Ledger, allowing people who use the hardware to transfer ether (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) or supported ERC-20-based tokens directly to another Ledger wallet. The move is notable as it marks one of the first instances where a decentralized exchange allows users to trade funds directly from one hardware – that is, physical – wallet to another. Radar Relay is already integrated with the browser-based wallet MetaMask. Ledger wallet owners can connect their devices to their computers, open their ethereum apps, and then use the Radar Relay app to send funds as needed. From there, users can choose their gas prices and tokens, and transfer their coins using the Radar app. Thus far, the integration has won plaudits from some quarters of the cryptocurrency community. Responses to Radar Relay's announcement were primarily positive, with Twitter users calling the move " amazing " and " a glimpse of the future." Radar Relay is built on top of the 0x protocol, first introduced last year, which seeks to facilitate fee-less transactions on the ethereum blockchain. 0x formed as a non-profit, as well, in order to encourage users to begin using the protocol. In August, 0x raised $24 million in an initial coin offering (ICO). The move comes just under a month after RadarRelay raised $3 million in venture funding.

coindesk	lightning-network-may-not-solve-bitcoins-scaling-trilemma	Lightning Network May Not Solve Bitcoin's Scaling 'Trilemma' - CoinDesk	2018-01-20T12:20	Frances Coppola spent many years working in banks and IT, and now writes and speaks about finance, banking and economics. Bitcoin has proven incapable of accommodating growing demand without deviating considerably from Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision of a "peer-to-peer electronic cash system." It was intended to provide a fast, secure and inexpensive means of making payments without using the traditional financial system. Today it still only manages a tiny proportion of the traffic of, say, Visa or Mastercard, yet has become cripplingly slow and very expensive. Solving bitcoin's scaling problem has become a principal concern of developers. But the problem has proved intractable. Now, making a virtue out of necessity, the buzz is that bitcoin is " digital gold." Its built-in limit of 21 million bitcoins makes it an ideal anchor for a hard-money financial system similar to a strict gold standard. A new payment system could be built on top of it. The problem is, it isn't possible to have full decentralization, a fixed money supply and sufficient liquidity for an efficient payments system. This is bitcoin's "trilemma." Immobile money In the gold standards of old, there was no trilemma. They were always centralized. For example, the "classical" gold standard of the 19th century was the heyday of the British Empire, which at that time covered a third of the globe. The pound was the currency of international trade, and it was backed by gold. Countries in the empire were forced on to the gold standard by the British government; countries outside the empire joined the gold standard, or even adopted the pound as their currency, because it made trade much easier. In the center of the web, the Bank of England managed both the price of gold and pound issuance. It was the most centralized financial system since the Roman Empire. But for bitcoin, the fact that it is designed as a decentralized system means something else has to give. And the clue is its rapidly rising price. Bitcoin is becoming illiquid. Bitcoin's growing illiquidity is due to a toxic combination of high demand, hoarding and designed-in scarcity. The rapid price rise indicates that purchases have increased much more than sales. More and more people are buying bitcoin in the hopes of cashing in as the price rises, while those who already own bitcoins are Holding On for Dear Life for the same reason. People are also reluctant to spend their bitcoins, because that rapidly rising price means that they face huge opportunity costs. And although bitcoins are still being mined, the rate at which they are mined is nowhere near enough to meet demand – and anyway, miners too can HODL their bitcoins. Meanwhile, rising transaction volumes are causing network congestion. Bitcoin has no means of adjusting capacity other than rationing verification. Miners verify transactions with higher fees more quickly than those with lower fees. Those who want fast verification (which is nearly everyone, since bitcoin’s price is rising so fast) will pay higher fees. Those who don't want to pay higher fees must wait longer for their transactions to settle. Bitcoin’s popularity therefore means both higher transaction fees and slower settlement times. The design feature intended to prevent it coming to a hyperinflationary end is driving it towards deflationary gridlock. As Business Insider asked, what on earth is the point of money that you can't spend and can't convert to anything else? But is there a way round this problem? The clever folks working on the Lightning Network think so. Their solution is to take most transactions off-chain, and to share liquidity across the network. Supply shortfall Lightning is a decentralized network of pre-funded, bilateral bitcoin payment channels off the bitcoin blockchain. Lighting transactions are typically small, and most are not broadcast to the blockchain. So they should be much faster and cheaper than on-chain bitcoin transactions. Assuming enough people open Lightning payment channels, there will eventually be a sizable bitcoin liquidity pool distributed across the network. The question is, how to enable it to be shared. Lightning developers are designing a routing facility that identifies which network nodes have sufficient funds to make a payment, calculates the shortest viable route to the payment destination across those nodes, and sends the payment. If this works, it would resolve the bitcoin trilemma. But it is not certain that it will work. There are two potential problems. The first is that Lightning's pre-funded channels tie up funds that could be used for other purposes. Because of this, people may choose to keep very low balances in their Lightning channels, topping them up frequently rather than making infrequent balance adjustments. And the second is that channel funding changes constantly. Typically, people would fund their channel, then pay the balance down gradually. Soon after funding, there could be quite a large balance, but only a few days later, the balance might have diminished considerably. If a lot of people fund their channels at around the same time – for example, if people fund their channels on payday, then pay them down over the next month – liquidity across the network could vary considerably. This would mean that, at times, particularly for larger payments, it could be difficult or even impossible to find a payment route. As it stands, therefore, Lightning could prove as illiquid as bitcoin. Lightning's illiquidity problem could be solved by creating large payment channels kept open and fully funded at all times, so that they were always available for payment routing. But this would mean Lightning was not fully decentralized. Such "hub" channels would be more efficient for payments, but they would be a magnet for thieves and a point of weakness in the network. If one went down, an awful lot of payments could be disrupted. The alternative would be to allow channels temporarily to go into deficit as a payment passes through. This would ensure that payments always settled. But since it is effectively fractional reserve lending, it would breach the "gold standard" principle of bitcoin. If gold is needed to settle payments, and you haven't got enough gold, you can't settle payments. That's how a gold standard works. It is also why it fails. Lightning is still a work in progress, of course. But at present, it is hard to see how it can resolve bitcoin's three-pronged problem.

coindesk	little-bitcoin-lightning-project-has-two-big-implications	A Little Lightning Project Has Two Big Implications - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T09:02	How will the Lightning Network change bitcoin? Although it might be too soon to know, it's a question everyone's seemingly asking following tests that take the long-anticipated tech closer to launch. The network's garnered its fair share of excitement over the past few months, so much so that individuals and businesses are looking to take advantage of its cheap, fast payments. Out of this comes a small Japanese startup called Nayuta, which has been experimenting with adding Lightning payments to the Internet of Things, where everything from door locks to BMWs are connected to the internet to increase efficiency. With this experimentation, Nayuta is exploring a couple of implications of the tech. First, the startup believes Lightning could bring value to the Internet of Things in a way that old payment systems and bitcoin couldn't because they're both simply too slow. Second, it's one of the first earnest businesses working on a product built on Lightning, showing that the off-chain network might actually have a business proposition, even this early on. Lightning + IoT Nayuta started off in 2015 by adding normal bitcoin transactions to the Internet of Things in a range of prototypes. But, like others using bitcoin, they were disappointed by its limitations. They found instant "zero-confirmation" transactions weren't secure enough and that 10 minutes was too long to wait for a transaction to be secure. Then Lightning came along, the idea being it's possible to actually make more secure instant payments (though there are still some caveats). Since it's faster than traditional payments, Nayuta decided it was the "only" solution to Internet of Thing's desire for payments that are as fast as the internet connections that fuel them. One recently popular Internet of Things product is the so-called "SmartLock." Rather than requiring the metal keys we're all used to (just one more thing to remember), the rightful owner can use their smartphone to unlock it. Showing the company's switch in gears toward Lightning, they released a proof of concept of such a lock that opens only once it's sent a Lightning payment. Neither of these things are particularly useful, at least in the current form (why would anyone want to require a payment to unlock something?). But, as Nayuta sees it, these proof-of-concepts demonstrate how real-time payments can for Internet of Things more broadly, one of millions examples being a sensor gathering data about an ocean, and a researcher directly paying the sensor a small fee over the Internet to get that information. The test payment was made between Nayuta's homegrown Lightning software implementation, dubbed "Thunderbird", and c-Lightning, an software implementation by bitcoin infrastructure startup Blockstream. In that way, not only does Nayuta "open the door" to interesting Lightning use cases, it also diversifies the number of Lightning software implementations there are, which the company thinks is important, because, it believes, some features are missing from current Lightning implementations. "We do not think Lightning is ready," Nayuta CEO Kenichi Kurimoto told CoinDesk. Lighting businesses emerge All this feeds into the second interesting thing Nayuta is doing: It's one of the first companies to build a business around Lightning, showing that perhaps Lightning has a business proposition. The handful of Lightning startups out there so far, such as Lightning Labs and Paris-based ACINQ are focused on the low-level technology, not building a product that their company around a particular application of Lightning. Though, Kurimoto admitted they're not really being sure what to make out of all the prototypes they've launched over the last few years. "We did not decide the product future. Currently we're concentrating on development of the [Lightning Network] software," Kurimoto said, adding that one company that they can't disclose due to NDAA using their software so far. Even so, Nayuta sees business promise in this area. Internet of Things payments have been floated for a long time, with even the likes giant payment processor Visa launching payment solutions in this area. But, to Kurimoto, the current financial infrastructure is behind the times. If refrigerators want to pay grocery stores and users want to use micropayments to pay for video and so forth, payments often need to be really small and fast. The current financial infrastructure wouldn't be able to handle it. Kurimoto said: "The Lightning Network is the only solution for real-time transactions."

coindesk	make-big-money-bitcoin-cash-irs-might-watching	Make Big Money on Bitcoin Cash? The IRS Might Be Watching - CoinDesk	2017-11-09T12:00	Bitcoin holders in the U.S. might be feeling giddy about the "free money" they've received as of late from bitcoin hard forks. But with tax season right around the corner, they might also be feeling a bit uneasy. While the money generated by the bitcoin cash hard fork – and the possible money generated by the bitcoin gold hard fork – has played a role in driving bitcoin's price surge, it's not all fun and games. Bitcoin owners have effectively acquired value for free, but there is still a cost associated with the assets. According to Perry Woodin, CEO of Node40, a TurboTax-like platform for cryptocurrency owners: "People are piling into bitcoin so they can get the free money, but I think very few people are thinking about the tax implications of it. And if they are, they’re probably thinking 'Well, I can get around it'." But that might not be clear thinking. For tax reporting purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently classifies bitcoin and "other virtual currencies" as property, meaning owners are legally obliged to report the capital gains and losses incurred from cryptocurrency holdings during each calendar year. As bitcoin cash and the other cryptocurrencies created from hard forks act nearly identical to bitcoin (besides some technical code changes), some wonder if the same rules will apply. Currently, though, it's all a gray area. "From a tax perspective, the bitcoin hard fork really is uncharted territory," said James Markwood, a tax attorney with Cogent Law Group in Washington. D.C. The choices For those crypto holders interested in playing by the rules, though, there's really no clear consensus from tax experts on what should be done. "There are really two choices, and neither one of the choices are particularly appealing," said Woodin. The first choice is to assign each new coin an arbitrary value to use as its cost basis. This could potentially be done by taking a weighted average of, for example, bitcoin cash's trading value in futures markets just before the August fork, or by assigning it a value proportional to that of a full bitcoin. Any increase in the price after the cryptocurrency's inception and before the end of the year would then be subject to capital gains tax. The other possibility is to assign the new coin an arbitrary value of zero and then pay the capital gains tax on the full value whenever the disposition of the coin occurs (when they are exchanged for other crypto assets or for fiat currency). The latter approach would seem to match up with the IRS' thinking on other types of second-generation assets, explained Markwood, noting the situation could be similar to that of a farmer who owns a cow that gives birth to a calf or a landowner who discovers gold on his property. Importantly, in both cases, the creation or discovery of the new asset would not necessarily trigger a taxable event. But when the assets are sold off, the full value of the disposition would be deemed taxable income. While the latter approach may sound more appealing to bitcoin owners because it allows them to effectively kick the can until they sell an asset, it's unclear whether or not that applies to cryptocurrencies. Bury your head? Of course, a third option is to simply ignore one's reporting obligations altogether, a strategy that – as evidenced by the IRS's assertion that only 802 individuals reported capital gains from bitcoin in 2015 – has been employed quite frequently by U.S. traders. While the approach was understandable given the complicated and labor-intensive process of reporting cryptocurrency (many traders may have been unaware of the requirements altogether), it becomes even more so since bitcoin holders sometimes don't have much choice over whether they get access to hard fork-created tokens or not. During the bitcoin cash fork, bitcoin holders were given bitcoin cash at a rate of 1:1, and exchanges that supported the new coin merely dumped the equal amount in users' accounts. "People are really looking to avoid this, especially if you’re not interested in bitcoin cash or any one of the new forks," said Woodin, adding: "You don't want to have to pay tax on something you didn't want in the first place." But crypto tax-evaders face much higher risk in 2017 as the skyrocketing value of bitcoin and the newly created class of crypto millionaires are drawing scrutiny from the authorities. The IRS has also wised up to how these new assets are being used and stored, as evidenced by the agency's John Doe summons of Coinbase user records in 2016, as well as this summer's revelation that the IRS has been using Chainalysis software to monitor the blockchain for bitcoin tax cheats since 2015. Chainalysis did not respond to requests for comment about whether the IRS continues to use its product. Clarity needed More than anything, new assets being created by bitcoin forks underscore the need for greater clarity from the IRS on how cryptocurrencies should be reported for tax purposes. The IRS guidelines for reporting cryptocurrencies has come under considerable backlash as too cumbersome, if not altogether impossible for higher volume traders or people using it to purchase everyday items such as a cup of coffee. "Taxing blockchain-based currency, like bitcoin, as property rather than as a competing currency has numerous adverse consequences," said Amy Davine Kim, global policy director and general counsel at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a Washington D.C.-based blockchain advocacy group. "Among other things," she continued, "it imposes onerous reporting requirements that are difficult to understand and ultimately inhibit the widespread adoption in retail commerce of this promising technology." It's interesting to note that the mission behind the bitcoin cash hard fork is to increase the block size, so that more transactions can be verified on the network at less cost – for supporters of the move, bitcoin's current block size limit is holding back adoption of bitcoin for retail payments. Many in the industry have asked the IRS for more formal guidance – the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act was introduced in Congress in an attempt to push the IRS to revisit its determination – but the IRS has yet to release an update. According to Kim: "Forks represent just one example of activities on a blockchain that may have tax consequences that, with little guidance from the IRS, are difficult to determine."

coindesk	makerdao-quest-stable-stablecoin-continues	MakerDAO and More: The Quest for a Stable Stablecoin Continues - CoinDesk	2018-01-24T05:07	Update (09.20 UTC, Jan. 24): This article has been updated with a response from Tether representatives. Usually, no one bats an eye when a cryptocurrency's price drops 30 percent over the course of a week. This is the Wild West, after all. But when it happened to DAI this month, heads turned, primarily because the token was designed specifically to hold its peg with the U.S. dollar. One of a growing number of crypto tokens referred to as "stablecoins," these cryptocurrencies are engineered to adjust their supply as the market shifts, issuing when prices rise and retracting when they drop, in an effort to keep their prices steady. Called the "holy grail" of cryptocurrency, stablecoins have been heralded as a way to strengthen the commercial case for blockchains, since many businesses shy away from the volatility associated with the sector. Case in point: an increasing number of decentralized apps (Dapps) rely on ether, and on internal crypto tokens dependent on ether, as a way to distribute value. As a result, unpredictable market shifts in the price of ether could cause chaos in the system. Dapp users would be less likely to spend their tokens if they believed the value might double overnight; conversely, should potential users suspect the value of the Dapp tokens will plummet, that could discourage them from participating at all. For this reason, Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO, the company behind the DAI stablecoin, which was launched in December, told CoinDesk: "[Stablecoins] are the first step before you actually see anything else interesting happening. I would argue that the reason why the blockchain world is so vapor-wary... is basically because you just cannot do business in an unstable environment." And in this pursuit of stability, interest in refining the stablecoin technology seems to be on the rise moving into 2018. Not only did an all-star group of investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Pantera Capital, back a stablecoin project called basecoin in October, but CoinDesk has heard more such projects are on their way. Plus the popularity in China of BitCNY – which is pegged to the Chinese renminbi and has entirely replaced renminbi trading pairs due to strict regulation of fiat/crypto trading in the country – led Christensen to describe stablecoins as "pretty much the best example of blockchain done right at the moment." Yet, according to critics, DAI's brief spell of trading for around 72 cents only foreshadows impending doom that the market has seen several times already with stablecoins. An inauspicious start While stablecoins see trading in the tens of billions of dollars per day, many crypto enthusiasts have called the technology the "single point of failure" for the entire crypto industry. Preston Byrne, an independent consultant and the former chief operating officer and legal counsel of Monax Industries, has even gone so far as to call stablecoins the "single dumbest creature in the entire universe," alluding to the Bugblatter Beast from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." And such criticisms are not entirely unfounded. Perhaps the most well known of the stablecoins is USDT (U.S. dollar tether), which acts as a stand-in for the dollar on some of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. And while that function seems to validate its existence, the company behind the coin, Tether Limited, has seen its fair share of controversy. For instance, last year, Tether Limited was allegedly hacked for $30 million in USDT. And in a wave of recent accusations, the relationship between Tether Limited and the Bitfinex exchange has been harshly criticized. While Tether's U.S. dollar-pegged crypto has been around since July 2014, formerly under the name Realcoin, Bitfinex, under immense pressure after losing banking relationships and the ability to send fiat wire transfers, ushered in broader use of the Tether stablecoin in 2015. USDT is widely seen as a substitute for traditional banking services, allowing users to withdraw and deposit dollar amounts quickly. But since then, there has been much scrutiny of the close ties between Bitfinex and Tether (the companies have common ownership and management ) and accusations of mismanagement. Some, most prominently the pseudonymous blogger "Bitfinexed," have gone as far as to claim that USDT has no material basis, and is instead steadily pumped into the marketplace to move the price of bitcoin upward. Speaking to CoinDesk, a Tether representative said, "The same principals have been involved in both Bitfinex and Tether since the beginning – that has never been a secret. Suggestions that USDT has no material basis have no merit. Tether is fully backed dollar for dollar." In December, a spokesman for Bitfinex and Tether said a forthcoming audit would show that tether tokens were fully backed. The company has also threatened legal action against its online critics. Similar issues also haunted NuShares after its distribution of the NuBits stablecoin in 2016. Even though the project set out to maintain the stability of the currency through economic incentives, following a wave of hacks and alleged manipulation of the peg by stakeholders, the stablecoin traded for as low as 10 cents the same year. At the time, NuBits core developer Jordan Lee blamed the blunders on "suicidal tendencies" in the community. Small numbers, big mistakes? Similarly cited by critics of the concept is the suspension of trading of BitUSD, what is perhaps the first stablecoin, on the BitShares exchange in 2014 after a security bug was found in the code. Yet remarkably, in the four years since that happened, BitUSD has mostly maintained its parity – although "mostly" is still problematic. Last week, BitUSD hit $1.10 per coin, according to CoinMarketCap. Small deviations of this type could incentivize traders to take advantage. Or as Christensen said, "If you’re buying DAI at slightly lower than one dollar and selling DAI at slightly above one dollar, in a dollar-denominated market, it’s just like a really easy way to essentially arbitrage the inefficiencies of the market." However, Christensen said, the tiny price fluctuations these stablecoins appear to have on CoinMarketCap don't translate to the price of the currencies on individual exchanges. Rather, due to how CoinMarketCap calculates the average price of cryptocurrencies, "there’s always going to be this volatility effect apparent on the price charts," he said. To him, it doesn't make sense to claim the technology isn't working just because it's seen a few pitfalls, since there are stablecoins operating successfully in the market today. "BitUSD is one of the first really good examples of a smart contract or blockchain 2.0 technology actually working really well and in particular, providing real world utility in a way that almost no other blockchain stuff has done before," Christensen said. Crude infrastructure Still, according to Christensen, discrepancies between CoinMarketCap and the exchanges where DAI is traded weren't at fault for that coin's drop last week. Rather, those price fluctuations, Christensen speculated, were due to a market-making trading bot gone awol on the Chinese exchange, Bibox. When that market maker went down, another high-frequency trading bot started skewing the price, he suggested. Underscoring his point, DAI traded for $1.10 on another exchange, Gatecoin, the same day it went for 72 cents on Bibox. And this volatility spooks crypto enthusiasts, who are worried about a potential " black swan event " or a "death spiral." In such a scenario, the asset a stablecoin is backed by suddenly falls, and in turn pushes the stablecoin down and with it the whole multi-billion dollar crypto market. But as these technologies advance, stablecoin creators are building in precautions. For instance, the team behind MakerDAO said it has mitigated the possibility of a death spiral by backing DAI with a diverse array of supporting assets, in an upcoming version of the DAI token to be released this summer. "So [a black swan event] is highly theoretical and should only happen in conditions of extreme negligence. And with proper diversification it should, in theory, be possible to prevent with 99.9 percent certainty," Christensen told CoinDesk. And all these instances just seem to display that the technology, and the surrounding crypto infrastructure, is still so new that hiccups should be expected. "Really early-stage markets for a new stablecoin are definitely some of the weirdest market conditions," Christensen said. He compared DAI's dip to BitUSD’s price drop following its launch, explaining that before these stablecoins become widely traded on a particular market, they’re vulnerable to bots and bugs. As Andy Milenius, a developer at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk: "When DAI volume is the tens of millions and then it demonstrates volatility, we will have something interesting to talk about."

coindesk	malaysias-central-bank-releases-draft-rules-cryptocurrency-exchanges	Malaysia's Central Bank Releases Draft Rules for Cryptocurrency Exchanges - CoinDesk	2017-12-14T20:00	Malaysia's central bank has published new draft regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges that operate in the country. On Thursday, Bank Negara Malaysia announced the move in a release on its website, asking the public to weigh in on measures aimed at easing money laundering and terrorist financing concerns related to cryptocurrencies. Following months of work in this area, the proposed regulations require businesses to verify their customers' identities, monitor transactions and report any suspicious activities to Malaysian authorities. Additionally, companies must report usage statistics to the central bank. If approved, the regulations would apply to any person or company which exchanges cryptocurrency on behalf of someone else. And while the regulations acknowledge that companies might use cryptocurrencies, the nation officially still does not recognize them as legal tender. The draft rules state: "Members of the public are therefore advised to undertake the necessary due diligence and assessment of the risks involved in dealing in digital currencies or with entities providing services associated with digital currencies." Bank Negara Malaysia is taking written feedback on the draft rules until Jan. 14, according to the release. The regulations were explained by governor Muhammad Ibrahim last month as tools to prevent illicit money transmission. While the regulations will only apply to exchanges – "which are being referred to as "reporting institutions" – the country's securities regulator is looking at creating a framework for cryptocurrencies in general as well.

coindesk	manufacturing-giant-midea-wants-to-put-bitcoin-miners-in-household-appliances	Manufacturing Giant Midea Wants to Put Bitcoin Miners in Household Appliances - CoinDesk	2017-08-24T14:00	Midea Group, a major manufacturer of electrical appliances in China, is seeking to patent a method for mining bitcoin with household items, public records show. The previously unreported application was submitted last November and published earlier this year by the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of the People's Republic of China. The company's application calls for appliances ranging from air conditioners, dehumidifiers and TVs to be built with specialized mining chips embedded inside. Once programmed, the products would connect to a cloud-based service and contribute their hashing power in the background. As the patent application's abstract explains: "The method comprises the following steps: controlling network access of the household appliance, and logging in a bitcoin account via the household appliance, wherein the bitcoin account is an account preregistered in a bitcoin [mining] website; driving a controller of the household appliance to [mine] coins in the bitcoin [mining] website, and storing the... bitcoins into a bitcoin wallet corresponding to the bitcoin account." According to the method proposed by the patent, running the mining software would not impact the normal function of the device, and the system works even when the appliance is not in use. As a result, "the service range and commercial value of the household appliance is increased," while also generating some extra income for the product owner. The concept itself has been explored over the years, by companies such as bitcoin startup 21 Inc., nor is Midea the first firm in China to weigh the idea as well. The viability of software patents in China is also a little unclear. Computer programs cannot be patented, but are eligible for some copyright protection. According to SIPO, software may be patentable if the combination of code and hardware constitutes something that is truly innovative. Midea Group, which employs more than 125,000 people, was ranked 450 on the Fortune Global 500 list for 2017. In financial statements from earlier this year, the company reported more than $22 billion in revenue for FY2016 – with $2 billion in profits.

coindesk	meltdown-spectre-cpu-flaws-mean-cryptocurrency	What Meltdown and Spectre Flaws Mean for Crypto - CoinDesk	2018-01-06T09:45	Recently leaked computer vulnerabilities Meltdown and Spectre offer yet another reminder of how hard the digital age makes it to keep private information – even cryptocurrency private keys – safe. Unveiled Wednesday, the widespread hardware vulnerabilities simultaneously impact Intel, ARM and AMD computer chips, which power the vast majority of the world's computers, mobile devices and servers, making it possible to steal private data such as passwords, financial information or just about anything stored on any device that uses one of these chips. Where this is important for cryptocurrency in particular is, hackers can potentially use the specific attack vector to pinch the private keys that allow users to control their bitcoins on the blockchain. Popular Mechanics called it a "horrific" bug, contending it's "hard to zero in on the most troubling part of this flaw," while an informational page authored by security researchers remarks that you're "most certainly" impacted by the bug. And though there's no evidence that any passwords have been compromised, experts say it wouldn't be surprising if hackers or the NSA have been exploiting the attack. If you're already following best practices for cryptocurrency storage, then you're probably fine. But if not, or if you're a newer user, experts say it's important to keep private keys on a safe device. "Better safe than sorry," said Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop told CoinDesk, adding: "An attacker who has knowledge of a sufficiently powerful vulnerability can theoretically force your CPU to reveal secret data such as private keys used to control your bitcoin." Attack vectors It's important to note that the advice to store private keys on a secure device is nothing new. (Crypto developers have long warned against storing private keys on laptops or other devices that interact with the internet.) But the reasons why might not be obvious for newer users. Even though bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are secure protocols, they must interact with the open internet and regular computers. In short, storing private keys so close to the internet can potentially expose users to hacks and theft. And the new CPU vulnerabilities make the situation even worse, as a chain of actions can lead to error and compromise. "If the protected memory problem is real, then a browser plugin or even a website may access your private keys," said Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli. The full details of the issue aren't yet public, so it's unclear what the precise attack vectors are. Still, others suggested a similar impact could be likely. "To get hit by this attack, all you would have to do is click a link by accident and maybe you end up on a website that serves a bad ad with the malware code that steals your data," Bishop added. And while these scenarios might sound far-fetched, most of today's malware prey on similar vulnerabilities that have yet to be patched. It's just impossible to know who and when they'll actually hit. Operating system fixes are now available that users should use to patch up their Windows, Mac, and Linux devices. But, for cryptocurrency users, the better option is not to store private keys on an internet-connected device at all, a recommendation common far before this particular vulnerability. One option is to store private keys on a so-called "hardware wallet," such as Ledger or Trezor. The small devices might not be quite as easy to use, but they are more secure in that their not connected to the internet. Pavol Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, went as far as to argue "Using a [hardware] wallet is now more important than ever!" While ethereum developer Lefteris Karapetsas quipped, "I bet Spectre and Meltdown is the best thing that could have happened for cryptocurrency cold wallet businesses." Exchange treasure troves Beyond solo consumer devices, a much bigger, more worrying target is cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses, which store cryptocurrency private keys for millions of users at once. Some cryptocurrency exchanges use cloud hosting services such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud to run their websites, rather than spin up their own servers. While these platforms make websites easier to manage, they are particularly vulnerable to these attacks. A hacker could theoretically spin up a server using the same hardware as a cryptocurrency startup running operations on such a cloud platform and suddenly have access to all of their data. In the crypto world, a hacker could hypothetically use this attack vector to steal private keys. On the one hand, many of the most popular cloud platforms quickly unrolled fixes. On the other hand, researchers worry that deep-rooted vulnerabilities could spawn unfixed variants, with possible lingering effects to come.

coindesk	micro-finance-giant-robinhood-makes-big-bet-on-bitcoin-trading	'Micro' Finance Giant Robinhood Makes Big Bet on Bitcoin - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T16:00	Stock trading mobile app provider Robinhood is jumping on the crypto-trading bandwagon. Announced today, the company, which was founded in 2013 as a way to democratize stock trading, said it plans to roll out bitcoin and ether trading services via its mobile apps next month. Not only does the company hope to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts to its more traditional products, but it's also launching the service to catch some of the momentum cryptocurrency has seen as of late. "We've come to understand that cryptocurrencies as an asset have exhibited clear and underlying resiliency and have integrated themselves as part of a diversified and balanced portfolio," Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev told CoinDesk. To start with, the service will only be offered to users in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire, but more states are set to follow. The company, which is regulated in the U.S. by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra), plans to offer the crypto trading service for free. Plus, it promises instant transfers on cryptocurrency purchases for amounts of $1,000 or less, a significant improvement on the time it generally takes for people to buy cryptocurrency for the first time. Tenev explained: "We view entering crypto as a way to extend our user base and build our brand." Crypto meets stock While offering the service for free could seem risky, Tenev said, the company hopes to attract investors from the $550 billion cryptocurrency industry to the platform and its products, which already provide revenue streams. Specifically, the firm charges for a premium service called Robinhood Gold that enables margin trading and after-hours trading. The company also generates revenue by collecting interest on cash and securities in user accounts similar to a traditional bank. Having raised a total of $176 million in venture capital, the crypto functionality is in line with Robinhood's push to add more products to its offering. Last month, the firm rolled out options trading and a month earlier, it added a web-based platform to its mobile services. But the move isn't just about luring cryptocurrency enthusiasts to its traditional products, it's also about giving users normally focused on traditional investment vehicles exposure to cryptocurrency. According to Tenev, the firm recently crossed 3 million accounts and $100 billion in total transacted volume. Speaking to the company's interest in bringing together traditional assets with nascent crypto assets, Tenev said: "We envision a world where people can have your cryptos alongside your stocks, ETFs, and more." Robinhood has not built its own cryptocurrency wallet, but will be using a third-party provider. While Robinhood will manage custody of the cryptocurrencies on the user’s behalf, Tenev said the company does not intend to make investments with the cryptocurrency its customers store. Coins to come While Robinhood customers will only have access to bitcoin and ethereum trading, effective immediately, the company will let customers add 16 different cryptocurrencies (bitcoin and ethereum included) to their "watchlist," a feature allowing them to monitor market data, read related news and create price alerts. Other coins that can be added to the watchlist are bitcoin cash, litecoin, XRP (Ripple), ethereum classic, zcash, monero, dash, stellar, qtum, bitcoin gold, omisego, NEO, lisk, and dogecoin. For now, Tenev isn't revealing any possible plans to start trading those other currencies, however, he said that a "listing committee" had been established to analyze factors such as security, functionality and demand to assess cryptocurrencies that could be added to the trading functionality or the market data list. And, while the company is interested in adding new cryptocurrencies to its trading platform, Tenev said Robinhood would not be adding more complicated asset classes tied to crypto, such as bitcoin or ethereum futures. He said: "We're focused right now on the coins themselves, and I think in the near future we anticipate adding a variety of other coins before we extend to new asset classes."

coindesk	microlending-trends-startups-look-blockchain-loans	Microlending Startups Look to Blockchain for Loans - CoinDesk	2017-12-08T14:00	A new of wave startups believe blockchain can help microfinance deliver on lofty promises. Billed as a silver bullet that could lift the poor out of poverty since the mid-2000s, microfinance, or the use of small loans to boost the unbanked, has failed to take off for various reasons – namely, a lack of transparency and the existence of middlemen that blockchain is said to eliminate. "The problem with microfinance is not that it's a bad model. The problem with microfinance is that the people who put money into microfinance are completely invisible to the people who get the microfinance, and vice versa," said Ashish Gadnis, CEO of BanQu, a startup seeking to build an economic identity platform on top of the ethereum blockchain. But while blockchain's transparency and ability to reduce middlemen have been extensively detailed, Gadnis said it was the tech's ability to help people achieve economic sovereignty when traditional financial institutions still won't bank them that led to his light-bulb moment. During a volunteer stint in East Africa, for example, Gadnis discovered that a farmer who had received numerous microloans was still turned away by banks, even though he owned land and had made money from his most recent harvest. Rather than putting her on the path to "financial inclusion" – the microloans seemingly had made worse off by trapping her in a vicious debt repayment cycle. Gadnis explained: "She had three different loans from three different microfinance institutions (MFIs), but she was not 'bankable' because she was operating at anywhere between 15 percent to 40 percent interest rates on each loan." Echoing Gadnis' sentiment on the issue, Deloitte argued in a recent paper that the notion that simply making more credit available to poor people offers a solution to poverty must be broadened and rethought. Direct to developing And according to blockchain proponents, the technology's ability to connect people directly to each other without middlemen is the first step in rethinking microfinance. Taynaah Reis, co-founder of peer-to-peer remittance and lending platform Moeda, began looking to blockchain because of this feature earlier this year. Reis explained that her inspiration for the project – which won first place in a United Nations-sponsored hackathon – was that one-third of the 200 million citizens in her native Brazil that have minimal access to banking services and are forced to take out credit lines with annual interest as high as 4,000 percent. Her company partners with local credit cooperatives that have existing relationships with customers in rural areas, but aren’t always able to extend services at affordable rates, if at all. "It’s not that [cooperatives] don’t want to serve these people, it's just that it's unprofitable for them to do so," explained Brad Chun, CTO of Moeda, arguing that blockchain allows for easier auditability and more operational efficiencies that ultimately translate to a lower cost of lending than traditional service providers using centralized databases are able to offer. While Moeda vets and decides which projects can be featured on the site to receive loans, once those projects are reviewed, lenders can send money directly to the recipients. In September, the company processed a $50,000 pilot loan to a cooperative farm in rural Brazil, making it possibly the first-ever such investment denominated in a cryptocurrency (the project's own Moeda tokens). Lending identity Blockchain has also been touted as a way to fix identity on the web, another area where microfinance has struggled, but Moeda and others are looking to iterate on. Scott Nelson, CEO of Sweetbridge, a platform over which users can lend money to themselves against existing assets via smart contracts, argued that blockchain's unique advantage in this setting is the ability to use existing affinity networks to help build and verify borrower identities. He said: "The principles behind the blockchain can be leveraged to extend trust networks that are already existent in the culture and allow those trust networks to extend credit directly." Such blockchain-based digital identities, proponents believe. will allow borrowers to build their own economic histories and credit profiles, even if they are invisible to the legacy banking system. "Identity is really the core of what the Moeda system is. We're not just providing financial services, we're providing an identity that is linked to everything that a person is doing," said Chun, adding: "It's not your traditional credit score, it's what your reputation to your community is." BanQu has rolled out a similar system in five countries. Its "economic passport" aggregates a variety of data points (financial history, land records, trust networks, business registrations) so those seeking loans can more readily demonstrate their qualifications to potential lenders. "So now, if I wanted to lend as a microfinance institution... I actually know who the farmer is, what land it is, how much they're producing, so I don't need four middlemen," explained Gadnis. "So as a microfinance institution, I can reduce the cost of borrowing." Long road ahead? While such innovations may carry significant promise, the path to widespread adoption is littered with roadblocks. For one, these projects will require buy-in from not only consumers but governments and traditional financial institutions during a time when global banks are de-risking. Plus, Andi Dervishi, global head of the Fintech Investment Group at the International Finance Corporation, said getting consumers up to speed on how to securely use such new technologies will likely be an uphill battle. "We have instances in Africa where people handwrite their PIN numbers on the debit card," he said at a recent event hosted by the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C. "If we think of cryptos in the context of (financial) inclusion, we're adding a layer of complexity rather than taking it away." Harish Natarajan, a finance specialist at the World Bank, echoed that sentiment, saying "the jury is still out" regarding blockchain's eventual usefulness in improving financial access. Natarajan concluded: "At this moment, it seems to be more like a niche product used in certain contexts and in certain settings."

coindesk	microsoft-hyperledger-un-join-blockchain-identity-initiative	Microsoft, Hyperledger, UN Join Blockchain Identity Initiative - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T11:30	Tech giant Microsoft and blockchain alliance Hyperledger have joined blockchain-based digital identity initiative, the ID2020 Alliance. Announced during the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland yesterday, the alliance – which aid agency Mercy Corps and the U.N. International Computing Center have also just joined – aims to improve people's lives through provision of digital identities. According to a press release, the group is developing solutions with a focus on user's direct ownership and control over their personal data using blockchain technology. At issue is the fact that over 1.1 billion people face not able to prove their identity, and thus struggle to access benefits and services. The situation also gives rise to more serious issues such as human trafficking, according to the World Bank. The initiative has now received a $1 million donation from Microsoft, as well as contributions from entities including Accenture and the Rockefeller Foundation. Accenture, one of the founding member of the initiative, announced a $1 million investment during the ID2020 Alliance summit last summer at New York. David Treat, MD of the global blockchain practice at Accenture said: "Decentralized, user-controlled digital identity holds the potential to unlock economic opportunity for refugees and others who are disadvantaged, while concurrently improving the lives of those simply trying to navigate cyberspace securely and privately." The release explained that digital identity that is user-owned would include government-issued forms of legal identification and allow a seamless authentication process for people and institutions. "We are building an ecosystem of partners committed to working across national and institutional borders to address this challenge at scale," Dakota Gruener, the Executive Director of the ID2020 Alliance, noted. Last June, Microsoft and Accenture unveiled a blockchain prototype for ID2020, that is powered by a private version of the ethereum blockchain.

coindesk	microsoft-resumes-bitcoin-payments-after-halt-over-instability	Microsoft Resumes Bitcoin Payments After Halt Over 'Instability' - CoinDesk	2018-01-10T11:00	Tech giant Microsoft is once more accepting bitcoin payments on its online store. According to Bleeping Computer, Microsoft temporarily suspended bitcoin transactions last week, with company sources citing the "unstable" state of the cryptocurrency. The reason was likely due to bitcoin's current high volatility and fees, the tech news source added. An unnamed spokeswoman from Microsoft has now confirmed to News.com.au that bitcoin payments have been restored. She stated: "We've restored bitcoin as a payment option in our store after working with our provider to ensure lower bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers." As CoinDesk reported, online gaming platform Steam also dropped its bitcoin payments feature in early December, citing chronic problems with the cryptocurrency's high transaction fees and volatile price. The news comes amid a period of extreme price shifts for bitcoin. Just a month ago, the cryptocurrency had soared to new record heights around $20,000. Since then, prices have fluctuated amid a general move downwards. At press time, bitcoin was trading at $13,770, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Microsoft first added bitcoin payment option for digital products in 2014, allowing U.S. customers to use the digital currency to purchase content like apps, games and videos from its Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox platforms.

coindesk	mobile-banking-app-revolut-adds-litecoin-ether-trading	Mobile Banking App Revolut Adds Litecoin, Ether Trading - CoinDesk	2017-12-06T14:45	Mobile banking startup Revolut is adding litecoin and ether trading to its app-based service. The move to add new cryptocurrency options follows the company's integration of bitcoin support last July, having completed a $66 million Series B funding round. Chief executive Nikolay Storonsky announced Tuesday that all customers would be able to begin trading in the new offerings on Thursday, according to TechCrunch. Further, users' cryptocurrencies holdings will act as a backup for their Revolut debit card. Effectively, if a user runs out of fiat currency when making a payment, the app will automatically convert the appropriate amount of a digital currency to make up the shortfall. Storonsky said the new integrations could help introduce more users to cryptocurrencies, adding that "despite being one of the hottest trends in the world right now, getting exposure to cryptocurrency has notoriously been time-consuming and expensive." The Revolut app currently offers digital banking, as well as card payment services via Mastercard. Users will be able to use any of the 25 supported fiat currencies to purchase cryptocurrencies within the app. Revolut is the second mobile payments company to announce expanded cryptocurrency support in the last week, with Abra launching ethereum support last Tuesday. Speaking to investors at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest, Abra founder Bill Barhydt said the app would support more than 50 fiat currencies along with the two cryptocurrencies.

According to a press release, MoneyGram will test Ripple's xRapid service due to its claimed speed and cost efficiency. The release noted that XRP transaction fees are significantly less than those of the bitcoin network. While existing money transfer companies need to have pre-funded accounts in different nations to ensure they are able to facilitate transactions, using XRP means the company can directly transfer funds from one country to another instead, Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse said. Garlinghouse continued: "The inefficiencies of global payments don't just affect banks, they also affect institutions like MoneyGram.... By using a digital asset like XRP that settles in three seconds or less, they can now move money as quickly as information." The companies will also test Ripple's other products, including xVia, according to the release. MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said the company looks forward to using xRapid in its pilot program, adding: "We're hopeful it will increase efficiency and improve services to MoneyGram's customers."

coindesk	more-blockchain-pilot-projects-needed-says-us-treasury-official	More Blockchain Pilots Needed, Says US Treasury Official - CoinDesk	2017-10-30T16:30	A government official involved in the US Treasury's investigation of distributed ledgers is pushing for further testing of the technology. In an article published in the Journal of Federal Financial Management this week, Craig Fischer, who serves as program manager for the Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT), part of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, offered a broad overview of the tech, writing that its potential application could lead to advances in data and information sharing. Yet before the government (which is pursuing a range of use cases across a number of federal departments and agencies) can get there, more trials are needed, according to Fischer. Elsewhere, he went on to highlight efforts by a blockchain working group within the Association of Government Accountants, which includes representatives from governments, enterprises and industry startups. He wrote: "To fully understand how DLT will impact our community, we must start developing relevant use cases, proofs of concepts and pilot projects. But testing is only the start of the solution." Earlier this month, the US Treasury quietly revealed that it is testing blockchain to see how it can digitally trace the movement of physical assets, such as smartphones and computers. At the time, the Bureau – which is responsible for handling interagency payments as well as borrowing funds on behalf of the government – said that it would explore other uses cases as well.

coindesk	mt-gox-creditors-want-bitcoin-exchange-taken-bankruptcy	Mt Gox Creditors Want Bitcoin Exchange Taken Out of Bankruptcy - CoinDesk	2017-12-12T20:15	A group of creditors of the defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox has filed a new court petition in an effort to prevent a possible billion-dollar payout to its CEO. As reported by the Financial Times, the creditors are seeking to move Gox out of bankruptcy and into a process of civil rehabilitation. If successful, the legal effort would shift the process of unwinding the company, which is primarily owned by CEO Mark Karpelès, and the 202,195 bitcoins held by the Gox trustee (worth approximately $3.4 billion at press time). Mt Gox infamous collapsed in early 2014 following revelations that it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars (at then-current prices) worth of bitcoin. The exchange, once the world's largest by trading volume, ultimately declared bankruptcy and its CEO was subsequently accused of embezzlement and data manipulation. Under current Japanese bankruptcy law, if Gox maintains its current status, it will pay its creditors the amount they had invested in U.S. dollars in 2014. However, due to the rise in bitcoin's price, this means Gox – and by extension, majority shareholder Karpelès – could receive a multi-billion dollar windfall, according to Fortune. Creditors contend that Mt Gox's liabilities can be easily paid off with its existing bitcoins, even after returning what the creditors believe is owed to them due to its current price. By the Financial Times' math, after returning creditors their bitcoin and paying off its liabilities, Gox would have more than 173,000 bitcoins remaining, which would be worth just under $3 billion. The Japanese court overseeing Gox's bankruptcy is now looking into the claim but has not yet made a ruling one way or another. "The creditors bringing the case say the outcome is likely to come down to a "battle of experts": those working for the bankruptcy trustee, who argue the current liquidation plan is more stable, and those hired by the creditors, who say their solution is quicker and fairer," the newspaper added.

coindesk	no-nuclear-japans-biggest-utility-turns-blockchain-power-pivot	No More Nuclear: Japan's Biggest Utility Turns to Blockchain in Power Pivot - CoinDesk	2017-10-10T13:00	The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) is no stranger to the risks of over-centralized energy sources. Perhaps best known for the nuclear meltdown of its Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011, the largest energy utility in Japan is now looking to blockchain in an effort to prevent another catastrophe. However, from distributed wind generation using tiny windmills to smart batteries that store power purchased when it's cheap to buy, alternative energy initiatives have historically been individual philanthropic pursuits. Jeffrey Char, director of TEPCO's venture capital arm, though, believes blockchain can help provide a business model for these innovative ideas and, in the process, lessen Japan's reliance on centralized nuclear power. Char told CoinDesk: "I was out looking for different technologies that would allow us to scale up operations in a distributed environment, and blockchain technology seemed to be a good fit." Since creating the venture capital arm in 2015, Char has publicly backed four companies: United Wind in Brooklyn, Via Science in Boston, Moixa in London and, most recently, German-based Conjoule – a joint venture with Innogy and TEPCO aimed at building decentralized energy solutions using blockchains. And while he's also brought TEPCO into the Energy Web Foundation (designed to explore blockchain for the energy industry), he said the "holy grail" of all these projects is to have individuals create, consume and trade their own energy. As such, his latest work – a signed memorandum of understanding between TEPCO and Grid+ – is aimed at exploring how blockchains could power peer-to-peer transactions for alternative energy sources. "What we hope working with Grid+ would enable is that it will give us some early insight into how to deal within those limitations," Char said. On the Grid+ Char's interest in Grid+ began more than six months ago when he offered the startup an investment opportunity. While Grid+ declined the money, it invited Char to join as an adviser, and that's where he learned how beneficial collaboration with the startup could be. Founded in 2015 as a "spoke" of the ConsenSys production company for ethereum startups, Grid+ is currently working on a piece of hardware it calls an "agent," designed to let individuals pre-pay for energy using either ether, ethereum's native token, or fiat currencies. By plugging ethereum-enabled devices into other smart machinery – such as the Tesla charging wall or the Nest thermostat – the company believes it can write algorithms based on customer energy usage that will allow them to buy energy when it is cheap. Now a standalone C Corporation out of Delaware, Grid+ is preparing to raise more than $50 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) of "grid" tokens. According to Char, the goal of TEPCO's agreement with the startup is to learn about the potential benefits of ethereum for decentralizing the exchange of energy. But it's not a one-sided agreement. Grid+ co-founder Mark D'Agostino said his startup expects to learn how to refine its algorithms for cheaper, more decentralized energy from TEPCO. D'Agostino told CoinDesk: "We'd like to work closely with TEPCO to partake in the optimization algorithms, wherein, if our agent device is going to make purchasing decisions better than current utilities, it's because we have granular insight into what the consumer consumption profiles are in a given home." Window of opportunity While it might seem strange for an executive at TEPCO to be looking for ways to cut Japan's reliance on nuclear energy, Char made clear his investment strategy. "I’m not a politician, so I don't lobby. I'm an entrepreneur, so I build businesses where I see problems, in order to solve those problems," he said. The particular problem of converting nuclear to a more decentralized alternative has a window of opportunity only a few years long, according to Char, which explains his increasing interest in finding the right partners and solutions. Since the Fukushima Daiichi power plant meltdown, Japan's nuclear consumption has dropped from about 30 percent to 2 percent, with remaining demands largely offset by the burning of fossil fuels. "We're burning a ton of gas and oil and coal," said Char. However, to maintain its obligation to climate control under the Paris climate accord, the Japanese government says it needs to return its consumption of nuclear energy to 22 percent by 2030, according to a Forbes report. Between now and then, Char hopes his company's investments can help prevent a full return to nuclear without a continued reliance on fossil fuels. That the Japanese government is largely deregulating the energy sector has already helped, opening up the field to competition that TEPCO itself has been blamed for helping stifle. Now, Char said, all that remains between the old nuclear paradigm and the future of decentralized energy are a few technical hurdles and regulations that prevent the spread of community-generated energy. From there, he says it's up to consumers to adopt the technology: "If we are able to scale up the deployment of distributed energy resources like solar, like wind, and deploy a bunch of batteries, the economics around that type of power generation and power delivery keeps decreasing."

coindesk	no-one-control-blockchain-supply-chain	No One Should Control the Blockchain Supply Chain - CoinDesk	2017-12-28T04:10	Samantha Radocchia, Ryan Orr and Maksym Petkus lead development and strategy at Chronicled, a San Francisco startup that leverages blockchain and IoT technologies to deliver smart supply chain solutions. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review. 2017 was a foundational year for blockchain. We saw the emergence of new networks, platforms, strategies and fundraising vehicles, and we saw the prices of major cryptocurrencies skyrocket. We saw ICOs. We saw blockchain enter the common vernacular. But the most exciting of all of these advancements in 2017, we believe, was blockchain’s ability to bring together disparate ecosystems – often competitors – onto a common back-end platform. One of the use cases where it can be beneficial to support trusted execution of business logic at an industry scale is in the supply chain. A number of companies for the past few years been working on blockchain-enabled supply chain projects including Chronicled, IBM, Provenance, SAP, Skuchain and VeChain. But at Chronicled we have a different perspective than the others, and we thought it was a good opportunity to share 2017 progress and our vision for 2018 and beyond. Privacy matters One misconception in the industry in 2017 was that permissioned blockchain infrastructure would solve the problem of data privacy. This is not the case. Any data stored on a full node – even on a permissioned blockchain node – is accessible to all of the other node operators in the network. In a supply chain context, where competitors are using a single blockchain, sensitive details around trading partners, shipping patterns and volumes can become available to competitors through their participation in the network. This poses a serious challenge. At Chronicled, we discussed this topic with a wide sample of executives in the pharmaceutical and precious metals industries, and recognized early on that this data privacy issue would make or break the evolution of supply chain use cases. We formed an internal company viewpoint that if we could not succeed with implementing a privacy solution, then blockchain systems would continue to be viewed as "toy systems" unlikely to gain industry-wide enterprise adoption for supply chain use cases. Through the first half of 2017, we focused our team's technical fire-power in applied cryptography on resolving this data privacy problem. We investigated more than a dozen candidate solutions in our blockchain lab in San Francisco and built many technical pilots to explore various methods of achieving data privacy. By mid 2017, after exploring the breadth of the technical solution space, we had identified a robust method that builds on zk-snark technology. This was a solution with the power to meet all industry requirements and serve as a backbone for an open supply chain network with full data privacy built on a decentralized blockchain infrastructure. As a next step, we spent the period of August through October with three expert applied cryptographers conducting a clean room review of the working implementation of the method. This included documenting the method with formal mathematical notation, as well as performing detailed calculations to determine the computational capacity and disk space that would be needed to apply the method at industry scale. The solution was optimized to support peak shipping loads and regulatory requirements for archival record-keeping in major industries. Today, as we head into 2018, we are feeling confident about the solution and we are excited for what the future holds. The secret ingredient Zero-knowledge succinct arguments have been studied by cryptographers in various forms for 25 years. However, modern constructions of zk-snarks have only arisen in the past five years or so. In a paper in 2012, Alessandro Chiesa and his co-authors coined the terms "snark" and "zk-snark,” demonstrating various alternatives to classical constructions. Since then, research on snarks has boomed, with each year seeing new approaches and techniques that improve our theoretical and practical understanding of them. The technology enables two parties to validate or prove to another party that a given statement, event, or bit of logic is in fact true, without conveying any information apart from the binary proof that the statement is true or false. In the context of supply chain, zk-snarks enable the confirmation of each transaction of physical goods in the chain of custody, so that a connected record of provenance can be maintained, without any of the players upstream or downstream of the transaction having access to information extraneous to their specific transaction. The statement from Zaki Manian in the clean room review document published by Chronicled earlier this month provides a summary of benefits of the solution: "During my years at SkuChain, I was involved in many supply chain use cases for blockchain and constantly bumped up against the requirement of privacy, which has not been adequately solved to date on any multi-company supply chain platform, blockchain or otherwise. It is clear that privacy is a key component for many supply chain problems and the lack of a solution has been holding back all of the industries. Chronicled’s implementation of zk-snarks technology solves this privacy problem, and when utilized to track prescription medicines, this method holds potential to save many human lives." This is unique because it is the first useful demonstration of a zk-snarks protocol that solves a completely different business problem than private value transfer pioneered in the zerocash protocol. Looking ahead to 2018 As we head into 2018, buyers of blockchain services should be wary of vendors who are entering the market late and have not had time to fully think through all of the trade-offs related to network topology, decentralization, performance, resiliency, openness and data privacy. We recently observed an attempt by one vendor to control ownership and access to underlying blockchain infrastructure. This feels eerily reminiscent of the days when AOL had aspirations to "own the internet," a strategy that flies in the face of the spirit and benefit of blockchain. We believe that in 2018 the industry will move towards solutions that embrace both decentralization and data privacy, and we are excited that progress in 2017 can now make this possible.

coindesk	nokia-trials-blockchain-bid-secure-health-data	Nokia Trials Blockchain in Bid to Secure Health Data - CoinDesk	2017-12-06T07:00	Finnish communications giant Nokia has announced a new blockchain pilot aimed at developing new ways to store healthcare data. In a press release on its website, Nokia announced that it had begun the project with OP Financial Group. One hundred participants are taking part in a bid to test how they could store and share their health data while also enjoying a degree of privacy around that information. The companies are using a blockchain due to the security features it offers, according to Nokia’s website. The software allows the company to control access to the data being collected, ensuring that only verified parties can access it. As Nokia explained in its announcement: "While the value of connected health data is widely recognised, it is often not leveraged to its full potential due to authenticity, availability and privacy concerns. Trust is a vital requirement in order for health data to provide the greatest benefit to individuals, families and our global society." The program uses wearable devices to track daily steps and hours of sleep, storing this data on a blockchain. These results are compared to users’ fitness goals. Users who meet or make progress toward these goals will receive loyalty points depending on their participation in the pilot. Nokia said that it believes this program can help develop "insights on global health issues" – provided that users trust the systems being used, that is. OP Financial’s laboratory head, Kristian Luoma, said this pilot program is an example of how blockchain can be applied to health programs in the future, particularly to applications which require trust from users. Nokia was one of a number of technology firms to join the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project in late 2016.

coindesk	north-korea-suspected-crypto-exchange-attacks	North Korea Suspected Again in Crypto Exchange Attacks - CoinDesk	2017-12-18T14:00	South Korea's chief intelligence agency suspects that North Korean hackers are behind attacks on the country's most-trafficked bitcoin exchange. According to a report this week by the BBC, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) has officially passed evidence of the allegations to prosecutors that would affirm attacks on a Bithumb employee's home computer dating back to February amount to a kind of espionage. Around 7.6 billion won ($6.99 million) worth of cryptocurrencies was stolen at the time, along with the personal information of some 30,000 people. First reported in July, the data leak is believed to have led to the draining of funds from an unknown number of accounts. The BBC report goes on to state that the hackers demanded a ransom of 6 billion won ($5.5 million) in exchange for the destruction of leaked information. Still, while investigations are ongoing, it's far from an isolated incident. In October, officials from South Korea's National Police Agency confirmed 25 employees at four different exchanges were targeted in 10 separate "spear phishing" attempts this year. The NIS also suspects North Korea was involved in an attack on another South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, Coinis, in September, and believes both incidents may be part of a coordinated effort to avoid sanctions.

coindesk	not-consortium-banks-form-profit-entity-blockchain-supply-chain	Not a Consortium: Banks Form For-Profit Entity for Blockchain Supply Chain - CoinDesk	2017-10-31T12:00	A group of eight major banks is close to forming a new kind of blockchain venture. In contrast to the consortium models common to the sector, We.Trade recently revealed plans to move much of the European supply chain trade finance to a Hyperledger blockchain. Yet, it's how the group is taking its technology to market that sets it apart: hardly another non-profit, the founders (which include KBC, Deutsche Bank and HSBC) have a direct equity stake in the project's success. With a tiered membership built to serve a single, valuable use case, and licensing members to use it, those involved believe they have created a structure that, while unique, is essential to the endeavor. As put forward by Roberto Mancone, global head of disruptive technologies at Deutsche Bank, the innovation emerged from the founder's demand for useful technology in a short time-frame. Mancone told CoinDesk: "[The joint venture] is the legal entity necessary in order to license the platform to other banks. Otherwise, as a consortium, you couldn't do it." And this isn't the only step that's being taken to get the effort off the ground quickly. After initial plans to launch in London were thwarted by the U.K.'s impending exit from the European Union, the joint venture is being established in Dublin, Ireland. Still, questions are emerging about how the group makes money. In addition to becoming licensing members, the founders (also including Natixis, Rabobank, Societe Generale, UniCredit and most recently, Santander) will receive an equity stake in the company. And it's this last point that might be most pertinent as the platform moves toward launch. Devil in the details As shown by conversation at Sibos earlier this month, convincing other partners that all members will be treated equally, even without equity upside, could take some time. At the conference, audience members expressed concerns during a question-and-answer session, as well as in conversation with CoinDesk, over the design, and what they hinted might be an inequality between the two member classes. The argument follows that, since blockchain networks tend to grow in value relative to their size, founders stand to benefit disproportionately from the services they provide to later members. However, those involved say the costs are designed to be equitable. While prices to join as a licensing member have not been disclosed, the fee is expected to be the same for founders and licensees. As such, those involved pushed back against criticisms of the model. "There is absolutely no difference in using the platform, regardless of whether we are shareholders or not," said Mancone. "We all end up being users of the platform provided by the joint venture." "We're confident that the value-add is proportionate to the cost to onboard," he emphasized. Permeable borders But there's another reason why We.Trade's founders aren't worried that the tiered model might discourage people to join: members can always upgrade. According to Mancone, a smaller number of founders were selected simply because it's faster to build a system with fewer parties, and not everyone even wants to be involved in that process. As the product matures, additional members are expected to upgrade to equity status, as happened earlier this month with Spanish bank Santander. Santander's head of network banking, Fernando Lardies, cited We.Trade's "speed of progress" among the reasons his bank wanted to get involved in the product development. And so far, the effort isn't a disappointment in this regard. The joint venture is expected to be completed this month, followed by a live launch of its platform in Q1 of next year and an expansion beyond Europe in 2019. But even as Lardies explained why his firm became an equity member, he advocated for the potential benefits that would come if his firm had simply licensed the platform. "Additional equity members are possible, we are counting on it – although an indefinite number of shareholders will have its drawbacks," said Lardies, concluding: "We are sensitive to concerns by user members to be able to influence product evolution."

coindesk	now-boarding-axas-ethereum-test-blockchains-ticket-mainstream	Now Boarding: Is AXA's Ethereum Test Blockchain's Ticket Mainstream? - CoinDesk	2017-09-18T08:00	Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers. As summer draws to a sultry close in the northern hemisphere, we should all spare a thought for those whose holidays were marred by lost luggage, hotel complications and very strange weather. However, one bane of the frequent traveller – delayed flights – could soon have had its day, and blockchain could play a leading role. That's because this past week, French insurance giant AXA unveiled a test run of a blockchain platform designed to manage flight insurance. Amusingly called " Fizzy," the product is a network of smart contracts linked to a platform based on ethereum that will scan data sources for information on delayed flights. If those flights match an outstanding insurance policy, a pay-out is automatically triggered. While the initial test is limited in scope – for now it only covers direct flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and the U.S. – its significance is potentially huge. On the radar Travel insurance is not a new concept – policies guaranteeing compensation for cancellations, lost luggage, etc., date back to the late 1800s. But, boosted by terrorism and extreme climate, it has enjoyed spectacular growth over the past few years, a trend that is generally expected to continue. That said, the sector itself has not kept pace with innovations in the travel industry, and – in spite of a surge of insurtech startups aiming to disrupt the way insurance operates – mainstream policies are structured and executed in much the same way as 50 years ago. This project, however, breaks ground, not only in the technology used, but also in its focus and market approach. While a handful of independent blockchain startups have taken a run at flight insurance, Fizzy is the first such project to be launched by an incumbent, and the first to make it to the mainstream market. Currently in beta with limited route coverage, AXA plans to roll the scheme out internationally next year. Plane truth Fizzy is also an early working example of an emerging sub-genre of "parametric insurance" – rather than compensate for loss, it originates a pre-established pay-out based on a triggering event. Traditionally limited to large-company catastrophe bonds, parametric insurance has the potential to streamline risk management, lower costs and increase customer satisfaction by removing uncertainty. This could be where blockchain technology has its most significant impact on the insurance sector. Executed on technology platforms, parametric policies can "go small," cover a wider range of eventualities and reach a much broader audience. But why blockchain? Why couldn’t a distributed database work? Because of the underlying issue of trust, often absent from personal insurance. As most of us unfortunately know, getting an insurer to transfer compensation is often a frustrating battle. A blockchain platform can remove the need to save receipts, submit paperwork and request pay-out authorization. It can also remove the required leap of faith that the issuer will honor the trigger, since the embedded conditions cannot be modified. Flight path Although the first mainstream test is focused on flights, it could be expanded to cover other types of transport. It could also end up both fragmenting and streamlining areas such as home and health coverage. If a police record of theft is uploaded, an X-ray is performed, smart car sensors detect an incident or hurricane-induced floods reach a certain level, a pay-out is automatic. In this light, the name that AXA chose for the service is surprisingly appropriate. In fizzy drinks, small bubbles transform a liquid substance into a more cheerful experience. In insurance, small parametric contracts could end up transforming how we interact with the sector – starting with personal insurance, but possibly spilling over into corporate and life policies. More accessible coverage for customers, lower costs along with a broader market for issuers and the emergence of a new type of financial security... This small blockchain-based travel insurance experiment is giving us a glimpse of what the insurance business could look like in 10 years' time.

coindesk	numbers-not-coincheck-isnt-another-mt-gox	Numbers or Not, Coincheck Isn't Mt. Gox - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T23:05	UPDATE (27, January 20:47 UTC): Coincheck has detailed its compensation policy for customers whose XEM was stolen. It will repay them 88.549 Japanese yen (about $0.81 U.S.) per stolen coin, out of its own funds, according to a Google translation of the exchange's press release. With 523 million XEM taken, according to the latest estimate. that would bring the total company payout to more than $420 million. The timing of the repayment is still "under consideration." The last time a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange was hacked for a record haul, it was a devastating blow to the ecosystem. Arguably, it took two years for it to fully recover. This time, the numbers may be similar, but the crypto markets flinched and took all of a day to bounce back. In this way, the massive Coincheck theft is superficially reminiscent of the infamous Mt. Gox hack of 2014, but differs in key ways that underscore how far the industry has come. To recap: Coincheck confirmed Friday that the hack, now likely the largest ever in the space, occurred on its servers early afternoon local time in Tokyo. Shortly after it discovered the theft, the exchange suspended trading of NEM, the stolen crypto in question, then of the other dozen coins it lists. All told, about 500 million XEM tokens, worth roughly $420 million, was stolen from Coincheck, according to Bloomberg. That's some $80 million more than was taken in the Mt. Gox bitcoin hack. While the initial news sent XEM prices down as much as 11 percent, data from CoinMarketCap indicates the price began to recover as of press time. Most of the other major cryptocurrencies slid, but only slightly, with declines in the single digits. But then, neither Coincheck nor XEM are as systemically important as Gox and bitcoin were four years ago. Different times In its heyday, Mt. Gox was just about the only game in town for bitcoin traders and altcoins were still something of a novelty. Today, there are many more exchanges, and many more cryptocurrencies. Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, calculated that the Mt. Gox hack represented roughly 5 percent of all crypto assets’ aggregate network value at the time. In contrast, the Coincheck theft represents less than 0.25 percent of the aggregate value, meaning "the impact of the Mt. Gox hack was more than an order of magnitude greater on the crypto markets at the time," he said. What's more, while the onramps for cryptocurrencies remain rickety, the markets have learned to differentiate them from the superhighways they connect to. As Burniske put it: "[C]rypto investors and speculators have been through a number of exchange hacks by now, likely recognizing that an exchange hack involves a vulnerability in the application on top of a protocol, as opposed to a vulnerability within the crypto-protocols involved … the fundamentals of crypto assets have not weakened, though we have yet another example of the need for further professionalization in crypto application-infrastructure." Recovery of funds? Another difference is that the Coincheck customers have some hope of being repaid, whereas most of the bitcoins stolen from Gox were never recovered and its users were not made whole. During a press conference Friday, Coincheck executives indicated customers would be compensated for their stolen crypto, though it is unclear at this time whether they would be fully reimbursed. Separately, Paul Rieger, a member of the NEM Europe team, told CoinDesk that his organization was tagging the stolen XEM and sharing the affected addresses with exchanges. Because NEM is an account-based platform, all associated accounts could be tagged, thereby letting exchanges know whether an account had stolen funds or not. Rieger said third parties helped with tagging the accounts by sharing information about legitimate Coincheck withdrawals. However, it is not absolutely certain that every account tagged contained stolen XEM, or that every stolen token has been tagged. Just another trading day Data from CoinMarketCap showed that while cryptocurrencies generally took a tumble after the hack was revealed, each of the top 20 coins and tokens by market cap began to recover over the last few hours as of press time. Many of these tokens are still down on the day, however, and it remains to be seen whether most of the coins listed on CoinMarketCap will move into the green. NEM’s XEM tokens notably began to recover after hitting a low of 76.5 cents per token – which is still higher than the 72.1 cents per token it traded at on Jan. 17. They had climbed to about $0.85 cents as of press time, after spiking to over a dollar just after the exchange suspended trading.

coindesk	okcoin-to-launch-cryptocurrency-exchange-service-in-south-korea	OKCoin Eyes Cryptocurrency Exchange Launch in South Korea - CoinDesk	2018-01-19T17:20	Cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin is reportedly moving to launch in South Korea – possibly as soon as next month. According to The Korea Times, the Beijing-based firm is eyeing a partnership with NHN Entertainment, a Korean developer, publisher, and distributor of mobile and PC games, for the venture. The news source suggests that NHN is considering the partnership and an equity investment, though the move has apparently not been finalized OKCoin was established in China in 2013, but had to shutter its domestic exchange operations in October 2017, following Chinese regulators' crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges. Since then, the company has shifted to an over-the-counter model, and turned its attention to international markets. The exchange has already put in place the OKCoin Korea website and is accepting pre-orders for cryptocurrencies before the official launch. It aims to offer more than 60 digital currencies to be traded against the Korean won, according to the site. The timing of the launch comes at a time when the nation's government has issued restrictions on cryptocurrency trading activities and is mulling a harsher crackdown on exchange-based trading. Cho Jung-hwan, CEO of OKCoin Korea, told The Investor that OKCoin is compliant with all the Korean regulatory requirements, and said, "there won’t be any problems."

coindesk	opening-hyperledger-consortium-create-experimental-labs-startups	Opening Hyperledger: Consortium to Create Experimental Labs for Startups - CoinDesk	2018-01-22T05:00	Hyperledger, the open-source business blockchain consortium, just got a little more open. Founded in 2015 to help businesses more easily spin up enterprise blockchain solutions, the consortium approved a measure last week to create what it's calling Hyperledger Labs. As an effort to bring early-stage startups together with companies that are formally recognized by Hyperledger, the measure stands to accelerate the rate at which new ideas find traction and reach maturity. "This is a way to expand the Hyperledger community," said Chris Ferris, the chairman of Hyperledger's technical steering committee and chief technical officer of IBM Open Technology. Companies were previously required to go through a grueling application process to prove the maturity of their code and a commitment of resources before becoming "formally recognized" by the consortium and obtaining "incubation status" for their code. To give an idea of how rigorous the application process for that status is, there are at least 185 Hyperledger members, but only eight codebases have been formally granted the incubation status. Of those eight codebases, only three frameworks have graduated to " active status " – Intel-contributed Sawtooth, IBM-contributed Fabric, and Iroha, contributed by Japanese startup Soramitsu, with support from Hitachi and several others. But this new measure now gives startups access to some of the benefits that only those companies formally recognized – such as IBM, Intel and Monax – had access to. Perhaps the most important being access to a separate GitHub code repository, where existing Hyperledger members and others can more easily identify the relationship to the consortium, examine the code being pushed to the repository, test it and provide feedback. In a conversation with CoinDesk, Ferris explained why the labs were necessary in the first place, and in turn, why the measure was unanimously approved by the TSC. He said: "We've had a couple of projects proposed for incubation [to] the TSC, and the TSC has declined the request, but not because the work was shoddy, but rather because we felt that the project wasn't ripe enough yet, hadn't matured to the point where we could really understand and see that there's a solid community behind it." Continuing, Ferris said the measure will be a way to engage those companies more closely, instead of turning them away. Perks of participation True, startups could already host a project on the general Hyperledger GitHub. "But then it's sort of lost in all the other thousands and thousands and millions of projects," Ferris said. Having the opportunity to get code directly in front of Hyperledger members is the key advantage to taking part in the initiative, according to Ferris. And with that increased visibility, Hyperledger members can provide valuable feedback that might possibly accelerate a startup's time to market, he continued. The code submitted to the Github repository under Hyperledger Labs will not be required to meet any functional requirements, but the startup that pushed the code will also not receive intellectual property rights to identify as a "Hyperledger Project," like those companies with incubation status have. The code will also not receive legal and security checks before major releases and will not be supported by the official Hyperledger marketing campaign like those with incubation status. But the companies that pushed code will be shared on the Hyperledger.org website. Overseeing the initiative will be a group of four "Labs stewards" from Hyperledger's TSC, who will give quarterly project reports to the broader community about participant progress, and kill projects that become dormant. Bas Van Oostveen, a Lab steward and director of engineering at software firm Context Labs BV, told CoinDesk he hopes Hyperledger Labs "will also provide a solid ground for smaller projects to find more contributors and guidance from the greater community." Expanding enterprise In spite of the complex process for moving code into incubation, Hyperledger, a non-profit part of the Linux Foundation, has had a number of successes over the past year. Of the several projects admitted for incubation status last year, it was the transition of others into active status that perhaps made the biggest impact. In March, Hyperledger graduated Fabric, Sawtooth and Iroha to active status, setting the stage for the July launch of Fabric 1.0, deemed the consortium's first "production-ready" platform. By the beginning of August, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and R3 had demoed a platform using Sawtooth, and Sawtooth Ethereum, or Seth, was revealed at the end of August with the aim of running ethereum smart contracts on Hyperledger Sawtooth. The following month, an open-source version of Interledger, developed by Ripple, was submitted to Hyperledger, with the goal of streamlining any number of blockchain integrations. Ferris said that's just a small taste of what's in store for Hyperledger in 2018. And if Hyperledger Labs does its jobs, the diversity of contributions will only increase. He concluded: "There's at least three [projects] that have been brought forward and that we've reviewed and that didn't make it to incubation for various reasons. And so those are likely to be in the pipeline for being in the Hyperledger Labs."

coindesk	opportunity-interoperable-chains-chains	The Opportunity for Interoperable Chains of Chains - CoinDesk	2018-01-27T10:50	Kyle Samani is co-founder and Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital, a thesis-driven crypto fund that invests exclusively in crypto assets. Today, blockchain interoperability is virtually non-existent. If you want to move value across chains, you must do so by moving tokens into a centralized exchange, trade on the exchange's in-house ledger and then withdraw the new asset on a new chain. This process is slow, expensive and involves substantial counterparty risk. Fundamentally, there are two types of chain interoperability: Relaying messages about the state of one chain to another. This includes synthetic tokens (AKA one-to-one pegs, two-way pegs, or sidechains). Cross-chain atomic swaps. The exchange of tokens between users across chains, without trusting a third-party. A number of high-profile projects such as Polkadot and Cosmos are vying to be the meta "blockchain of blockchains." Each of these systems has a native staking token that validators must stake in order to perform work for their respective networks. Another chain of chains, Block Collider, proposes a radically different technical mechanism to achieve many of the same functions. Building on insights drawn from Vitalik Buterin's excellent paper on chain interoperability, I'll walk through both of the functions above and highlight that the largest opportunity for these systems is message relaying. Cross-chain atomic swaps can be accomplished trustlessly without dedicated chain of chain systems. Cross-chain messaging Cross-chain messaging is fundamentally a question of trust: How does one design a system to trustlessly relay messages between chains? This is especially difficult given what I'll refer to as orphan chain risk: if a service relays the state of Chain A to Chain B, but it turns out that the relayer was on a fork of Chain A that is ultimately orphaned (either benignly or maliciously), then the relayed message to Chain B is invalid. If one is relaying messages to issue synthetic tokens across chains, this would result in cross-chain double spends, which is unacceptable. Accommodating the perpetual "what if the relayer is on an orphaned fork" risk is by far the greatest challenge in message-relaying systems. Cosmos and Polkadot address the orphaned-chain problem through two mechanisms. First, using the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, they store Merkle-ized block headers for each cross-chain transaction. Building on a history of Merkle-ized block headers, Cosmos/Polkadot maintain global invariant balances of the total supply of each token. Together these mechanisms prevent cross-chain double spends. It would be nice if systems such as Oraclize could relay messages between chains. But these kinds of systems don’t account for the orphaned chain problem. If we look out into the future, it’s possible to envision a time in which the orphaned chain problem is solved by the sending chain itself. How? By leveraging finality in proof-of-stake (PoS) based systems. This is the explicit purpose of Casper FFG, which is in alpha now. However, it's unclear how fast finality can be given tradeoffs in parametrizing such a PoS system. Even with a finality guarantee, there are still other challenges. We're currently witnessing a Cambrian explosion of blockchain innovation. This is likely to continue for the next few years at a minimum. Given the number of new chains that are emerging, each chain will be required to store and validate Merkle-ized block headers of every other chain with which it communicates. Each blockchain could become bloated with blockheaders of every other chain. Using a bridge chain reduces the bloat per chain from a function of n! to to a function of n. While I'd like to see a future in which blockchains communicate directly with one another without an intermediary chain, this seems highly unlikely. This problem is compounded by the fact that systems such as bitcoin may never move off of proof-of-work (PoW) consensus and towards PoS consensus with guaranteed finality. If you project out far enough, it seems possible that intermediary chains will become superfluous, but that future is still unclear. For the foreseeable future – at least a few years – Cosmos/Polkadot have a real opportunity to become the backbone powering cross-chain messaging. Cross-chain atomic swaps The first cross-chain atomic swap recently occurred between Litecoin and Decred. These are both chains that don't support Turing-complete programming languages. Cross-chain atomic swaps will be technically easier to implement between general-purpose smart contract platforms. It will take another one or two years for these libraries to mature and become widely adopted, but they will. There aren't many technical questions remaining. The other major challenge with cross-chain atomic swaps is price discovery and order matching. That's where decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as 0x and OmiseGo come into play. OmiseGo is fully decentralized, meaning that the order book lives on chain. In 0x, orders are hosted by relayers (centralized entities), who then submit matched orders to the chain for settlement. If the market ultimately demands DEXs to be fully decentralized – including on-chain order books – then systems like OmiseGo will be necessary for cross-chain atomic swaps to function. However, given the intrinsic limitations of on-chain order books (settlement time, miner front-running, miner griefing, etc), I believe that the 0x model will prevail for the foreseeable future. Although 0x only works within the ethereum ecosystem today, the 0x roadmap includes cross-chain* support (it will likely leverage much of the tech built in the Litecoin-Decred proof of concept for Scrypt based chains). 0x relayers will host order books for price discovery, and will relay messages between chains to trigger the release of funds from the escrow on each chain. This should offer many of the best elements of decentralization (no counterparty risk) and centralization (speed, order matching), with minimal trust guarantees (only that the relayer actually relays the messages to both chains). On-chain DEXs are theoretically possible. However, given the limitations they face, the intrinsic network effects of liquidity in order books, time-to-market and go-to-market advantages, and minimal trust guarantees of a 0x relayer, I contend that the 0x model will prevail, leaving little opportunity** for Cosmos/Polkadot/Block Collider-based DEXs. Conclusion With the Cosmos launch approaching in the next month or two, we're about to witness a huge hype cycle about the opportunity for an internet of blockchains. Systems like Cosmos solve fundamental cross-chain communication problems, but aren’t necessarily the answer to all cross-chain communication challenges. It's paramount to recognize that not everything these systems can do actually needs to be done by a chain of chains. As the crypto ecosystem evolves, expect more diversity in trust models, relayers, and solutions broadly. * Note: Cross-chain atomic swaps are only possible if both chains offer a native escrow function. This requires bitcoin-esque script functions at a minimum. Some chains, such as IOTA and sia, for example, don’t support on-chain trustless escrows at all, and as such cannot implement trustless cross-chain atomic swaps. ** One of the greatest limitations of cross-chain atomic swaps is settlement time. By definition, these transactions can only settle as fast as the block time of the slower of the two chains. Block Collider’s system allows for settlements that are theoretically even faster than the block times of either chain. Enabling cross-chain swaps to settle more quickly than the block times of either chain is a pretty wild idea. Given how slow bitcoin blocks are, Block Collider could carve out an interesting niche.

coindesk	overstock-payments-glitch-mixes-up-bitcoin-and-bitcoin-cash-report	Overstock Payments Glitch Mixes Up Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash: Report - CoinDesk	2018-01-10T13:00	Online retail giant Overstock.com has reportedly experienced a cryptocurrency payments bug that could have allowed customers to mint money simply via repeated cancellation of orders. Last week, North Carolina-based bank security firm Bancsec informed journalist Brian Krebs that Overstock.com had erroneously accepted bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin as payment for a product. To confirm the issue, Krebs ordered a $78 motion sensor light on Overstock and opted to make payment by bitcoin. "Logging into Coinbase, I took the bitcoin address and pasted that into the 'pay to:' field, and then told Coinbase to send 0.00475574 in bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin," Krebs writes on his website. Because of the glitch, the security specialist was able to make a $78 purchase by sending approximately $12-worth of bitcoin cash. As experienced by Bancsec, Overstock's website approved the transaction. What was potentially more damaging to the firm is the fact that, upon cancellation of the order, Overstock processed the refund in bitcoin. Currently, a single bitcoin is priced at around $14,000, while its offshoot bitcoin cash is trading at $2,400. So, a malicious customer could have easily made large amounts of money simply by making repeated cancellations of orders of high-priced items at Overstock. Krebs writes: "Reached for comment, Overstock.com said the company changed no code in its site and that a fix implemented by [payments partner] Coinbase resolved the issue." Coinbase reportedly said that the issue was caused by "the merchant partner improperly using the return values in our merchant integration API," and noted that no other Coinbase customer had reported the problem. The error had existed for about three weeks, it added. Krebs said he and Bancsec had looked for the same glitch at other merchants that "work directly with Coinbase in their checkout process," but they found "no other examples of this flaw."

coindesk	overstocks-launching-initial-coin-offering-next-month	Overstock's TØ is Launching an Initial Coin Offering Next Month - CoinDesk	2017-10-24T20:59	Overstock.com subsidiary tØ has formally announced an initial coin offering (ICO), set to begin next month. Debuted at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas, the ICO will be facilitated via the sale of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), a model that was previously used in token sales like the one for filecoin, which raised more than $200 million. The tZERO token, according to statements, will trade on the alternative trading system (ATS) being developed by the firm. The Argon Group and RenGen – companies hired to advise on the development of the ATS – will also work on the SAFT offering. Patrick Byrne, Overstock.com's CEO and the chairman of tØ, struck an ambitious tone about the planned sale and what it means for the company's efforts more broadly. Byrne said in a statement: "While many doubted, the tZERO team worked hard, to be at the tip of the spear in creating and launching credible, capable and institutionally scalable blockchain technologies for crypto assets. Today those efforts are attracting interest from both the crypto community and the largest global institutional funds." Word about the planned token sale emerged earlier this month, when Byrne told the International Business Times that the token would be used to facilitate on-platform payments. Notably, he predicted that the sale would garner as much as $500 million, depending on the interest from accredited investors (like some past sales, the tZERO offering is being restricted). The tØ ICO will first run as a private pre-sale from Nov. 15 to Dec. 31. The proceeds from the ICO will help the company scale its technology development and regulatory teams, as well as either build or take over a custody and clearing firm, according to the company.

coindesk	pboc-official-pushes-centralized-state-digital-currency	PBoC Official Pushes for Centralized State Digital Currency - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T09:00	China's central bank is considering its own digital currency, but it may not be built with blockchain technology, according a senior official. In an op-ed article published by news outlet Yicai, Fan Yifei, vice governor of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), outlined the bank's direction on a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC). Fan stated that that central bank's CBDC will inherently differ from decentralized tokens, while centralized management and issuance will remain a high-level priority. "CBDC will still be the central bank's liability to the public. The nature of this liability will not change just because of the physical form of cash going digitalized. Therefore, we must ensure the central role of PBoC in issuing CBDC," Fan wrote, adding: "A CBDC will also help curb the public's demand for private cryptocurrencies, which will strengthen the role of our sovereign currency." The official further detailed that, unlike most cryptocurrencies, the CBDC might not operate via a peer-to-peer mechanism, which brings the key features of anonymity and untraceability. He explained that transactions using CBDC will be visible to the central bank, which would function as a third party to bring oversight on potential money laundering and illegal financing. Fan's comments are the latest from the central bank that provide a glimpse into its possible direction on the CBDC after having established a research arm for the issue. These comments are also in line with arguments made by Yao Qian, the director of PBoC's digital currency research lab. While the lab works on the R&D of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, Yao said last year in a conference that development of CBDC should not be confined to the ideology of blockchain's decentralization and distributed ledger technology. In yesterday's article, Fan further specified that the central bank will be cautious in introducing smart contracts – a feature of some blockchain platforms that can automate certain processes – to the CBDC system. He argued that since a CBDC will essentially be a substitute for the country's fiat currency, existing laws that apply to the yuan should also extend to the digital currency. Currently, Chinese laws specify that Chinese yuan can only be used in pricing, circulation, payment and storage, thus so should the CBDC. Fan explained that adding smart contract functionality to the PBoC's digital currency might enable other functions such as automating of taxation and fund raising, which could be unlawful activities.

coindesk	pboc-reportedly-orders-payment-services-to-stop-serving-crypto-traders	PBoC Reportedly Orders Payment Services to Stop Serving Crypto Traders - CoinDesk	2018-01-19T15:00	The Business Administration Department of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has reportedly issued a document today requiring payment providers in Beijing to stop facilitating cryptocurrency trading activities. The news, first reported by Securities Times, a state-owned media outlet launched by the Communism Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, said the document requires payment companies to start internal investigations to ascertain if cryptocurrency trading activities are being conducted via their payment services. If so, they should subsequently cease servicing those accounts, the document states. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the news source said the document also requires these companies to report on their investigation and implementation by Jan. 20. The document, if genuine, may come as part of plans to implement a wider ban on China's crypto trading scene that was reportedly sought by the PBoC's vice governor Pan Gongsheng. Another China-based outlet, the Economic Observer, reported that it has confirmed the veracity of the document through another source close to the central bank. The Business Administration Department is a Beijing-based division within the PBoC that specifically implements monetary polices in the country's capital. According to Securities Times, the document requires payment services within its jurisdiction to comply with its request. While it might appear that the rule only applies to services registered in Beijing, the document requires the firms to extend the investigations across their other branches. It remains unclear at this stage what immediate impact this may have on China's remaining cryptocurrency trading activity. Following the ban on initial coin offerings by the PBoC last year, China's cryptocurrency exchange activities have mostly shifted to over-the-counter (OTC) trading. For example, Huobi and OKCoin, previously two of the biggest order book exchanges in China, now offer platforms where Chinese residents can advertise their buy and sell orders, and the resulting transactions in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies are separated. Trading partners would send Chinese Yuan through payment tools such as bank transfers, WeChat Pay and AliPay, which appear to be like any normal transactions between two individuals. Other OTC platforms also exist through the group chat function of messaging giant WeChat and Telegram. With the data center of the latter service being outside the jurisdiction of the Chinese government, it has become a popular venue for OTC trading among Chinese investors. A CoinDesk telephone call to the Business Administration Department of the PBoC for comment was not answered.

coindesk	periodic-table-blockchain-classify-tokens	The Periodic Table of Blockchain - CoinDesk	2018-01-28T09:11	Dr. Pavel Kravchenko holds a PhD in technical sciences and is the founder of Distributed Lab. For many years, people used to believe that the Earth consisted of an amalgam of four elements – earth, fire, water and air. It took until nearly 1750 for scientists to realize that fire isn't an element, but the result of a process. Later, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev unveiled his Periodic Table of Elements, which showed which chemical elements could actually exist, including those not present here on Earth. Mendeleev's work led to a purposeful search and a synthesis of elements, resulting in breakthroughs in many different industries. There's a feeling that people today are doing the same with digital assets – naming them as traditional cryptocurrencies, ICO tokens, utility tokens etc. This leads to the confusion for the media and the wider crowd. They start to believe that everything containing crypto – or token – is magic and possesses some kind of new features and monetary model. Regulators are the last to catch up, sometimes allowing everything that looks innovative, without deep analysis of the matter. Defining some criteria of digital asset classification will move forward the whole industry and simplify the job of investors and regulators. Definitions and preconditions A digital asset is anything that exists in binary format, and comes with the right to use it. Digital assets are scarce – meaning that at any particular moment of time there can be only one defined owner (or group of owners) of the asset. A token is an accounting unit that represents its owner's balance in a designated asset. Principles of classification There are five processes in a digital accounting system, which may have at least three states (centralized, decentralized, not possible), and which can be managed by one or separate roles: Governance Custody Issuance and distribution Transaction processing Audit Different combinations of the ways these processes are managed lead to the different types of digital assets (which we call the distributed periodic table). Examples These are the most common for now or established terms. Cryptocurrency A network that performs the issuance and initial distribution of a currency, in addition to processing transactions in a decentralized way, using a secure, provable mathematical algorithm. All five processes are managed by this algorithm, which is run independently by each participant. The key property of a cryptocurrency is the level of decentralization (the number of participants, and the correlation between their decisions). Another important property is permissionless participation, which requires a censorship-free system. The extreme conditions for cryptocurrency are: Undefined number of participants-validators: who are fully anonymous who have no reputation and whose transactions are fully private. Good examples are proof-of-work-based currencies such as bitcoin and monero. Central bank currency A system with all five processes centralized and managed by a central bank, in which digital currency is pegged to a national currency on a 1:1 ratio. Digital currency In some systems, processes such as validation of transactions, fee set-up and updates can be handled by the decentralized network of users – while currency issuance and initial distribution is managed by a centralized organization. Custody is not applicable, because there is no collateral at all. Good examples are Ripple, Stellar, IOTA. Commodity-backed tokens A commodity is an item produced to satisfy wants or needs. Commodity-backed tokens represent ownership rights in a particular amount of a commodity. Tokens are managed in a system with centralized governance, custody and issuance. These processes are performed by a service provider, or by the custodian of a physical commodity. One token is always backed by a fixed quantity of the commodity, and the 1:1 ratio is guaranteed by a designated party. Examples are the U.S. dollar prior to 1971, a token which represented gold, or warehouse receipts – in these cases, processing and audit is done in a centralized way too. An example from the crypto world would be Tether, whose processing is decentralized. Equity tokens A security is a fungible financial instrument that represents some type of financial value. Equity represents ownership in a company or participation in its revenue stream. Security tokens represent ownership of an underlying security, or a share in a cash flow generated by the system. Tokens are managed in a system with centralized governance, custody and issuance. These processes are performed by a depository, or by a company itself. One token always represents a certain number of shares, or a percentage of cash flow. Processing can be done in a centralized way by a depository. An example from the crypto world would be DAO tokens, whose processing is decentralized. Accounting tokens Accounting tokens represent something that makes sense to account, yet doesn't make sense to transfer. Governance, issuance, custody and audit are centralized. Identity, reputation, and ratings are examples of such assets. Web-of-trust identities belong to this category, although in that case issuance, custody and audit are decentralized. Digital collectibles A collectible is any object regarded as being of value or interest to a collector. These objects are unique and non-fungible. Token represents ownership of a particular object. Governance and issuance are centralized. CryptoKitties are examples of such assets. Utility tokens Utility is a quality of an object's usefulness. Utility tokens represent the right to use system functionality. The role of utility tokens is to make system usage simpler than it was without them, which is true under certain conditions. Utility tokens provide several functions – as internal currency, accumulation of system’s value, or accounting. In the long run, utility tokens have to fragment into divisions – digital currency, security tokens, accounting tokens. Governance and issuance are centralized. How to determine the type of a digital asset Here are some questions to ask to figure out which category a token belongs in: Does the token represent a designated asset? is the asset fungible? does the provenance matter? Is emission of the token is predefined by a mathematical algorithm (constitution)? is there a process of changing the constitution by the users? Does it make sense to transfer tokens between owners? Does token ownership represent participation in profits (the value or business model) generated by the system? Does the system have a particular owner who is providing the service or is guaranteeing custody of an underlying asset? Does any transaction with the token affect all the participants in the system? Does token ownership represent a share in a particular business? Does it make sense if the token's price rises indefinitely? how would the fees in the system be affected? if the system provides a service, would this become too expensive? Can the system function without a token? can it use other tokens (cryptocurrencies, etc.) for payments and rewards? does the system need its own monetary policy (balancing supply and demand)? if the token is used for the DDoS attack prevention, are there alternative ways of protection? The analysis Prior to the emergence of bitcoin, it was believed that all the five processes could only be handled in a centralized way. Bitcoin, however, showed that it was perfectly possible to set up decentralized financial systems. When we said that each process can be executed in three ways (centralized, decentralized, or process is not possible), the outcome is that there are hundreds of possible combinations. Let's explore some of them: All the processes are centralized – this is fine, and it gives us a central bank currency. All the processes are decentralized – an option that gives us bitcoin. The first four of the processes are decentralized, but audit is impossible – such systems exist, such as the cryptocurrency monero (or zcash). The first four of the processes are decentralized, but audit is centralized. This is possible – for example, if the the initial secure parameters for zcash hadn't been destroyed ( which some suspect to be the case ). Governance and issuance are centralized, but custody, processing and audit are decentralized – a case we see in Ripple or Stellar. All processes are centralized, but transactions are impossible – this is PKI (a centralized public key infrastructure). Governance is centralized, custody, issuance, audit are decentralized, but transactions are impossible – this corresponds to identity on blockchain. Transactions are impossible, all the rest is decentralized (audit might not be possible) – web-of-trust identities. Custody is impossible, Issuance and other processes are centralized – land registry. Custody is impossible; issuance and governance are centralized; processing and audit are decentralized – land registry on a blockchain. Strange new worlds We are on the edge of a major breakthrough when we will see new new business models and application of tokenization. They will become possible due to technological improvements of cryptographic tools (efficient homomorphic encryption, short and fast zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, quantum computing), mesh networks, networking infrastructure, etc. These new business models will largely rely on new synthesized types of assets and will entail significant economic and social shifts. It's important to have a precise vocabulary to make sense of it all.

coindesk	philippines-sec-plans-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-trading-icos	Philippines SEC Plans to Regulate Cryptocurrencies, ICOs - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T16:15	The Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday it is crafting rules to regulate cryptocurrency transactions to protect investors and reduce the risk of fraud. The regulation, which will cover issuance and registration of cryptocurrencies, is expected to be finalized this year, said Emilio Aquino, SEC commissioner in charge of enforcement and investor protection, according to Reuters. Aquino stated at a press conference: "We want to come up with our own set of regulations. You have to be extra careful how investors in this new space are protected." Aquino further said that the regulations are expected to be finalized this year and will include the issuance and registration of cryptocurrencies. Guidelines on cybersecurity of cryptocurrency markets and investors' financial literacy and eligibility are expected to be included in the regulation. "Unfortunately, there have been a lot of cases where ICO promoters vanish into thin air. We don't want that to happen here," Aquino stated. Local news source Philstar Global also suggested that ICOs may have to register with the SEC since it considers cryptocurrencies to be securities. Earlier this month, the SEC warned the public to take the necessary precautions in dealing with ICOs, and also filed a cease-and-desist order against four companies and an ICO operator citing securities registration regulations. Elsewhere, Chinese authorities outlawed ICOs last September, saying they were illegal under domestic law. "It is a kind of non-approved illegal open fund-raising behavior, suspected of illegal sale tokens, illegal securities issuance and illegal fund-raising, financial fraud, pyramid schemes and other criminal activities," a joint statement read at the time. And, in September 2017, the South Korean Financial Services Commission prohibited local companies from taking part in ICOs, which it described as overly speculative and constituting a "violation of the capital market law."

coindesk	philippines-securities-regulator-orders-halt-ico	Philippines Securities Regulator Orders Halt to ICO - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T18:30	The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission filed a cease-and-desist order against four companies and an operator running an initial coin offering (ICO), citing securities registration regulations, a newly released document reveals. The order, dated Jan. 9, 2018 and posted on the agency's website today, cites four affiliated companies – Black Cell Technology Inc., Black Sands Capital Inc., Black Cell Technology Limited and Krops – as operators of the KropCoin token sale, claiming to sell "the world’s first agriculture marketplace crypto equity ICO." The document also identifies Filipino resident Joseph Calata as a founder or executive for all four companies. All four of the companies declare their affiliation with the KropCoin token, which the filing notes is built on the ethereum network. While ICOs are not regulated within the country, the SEC’s Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) claims that "there is substantial evidence that [the companies] are selling or offering securities in the form of KROPS Tokens and/or Kropcoins to the public, in the Philippines, without the necessary license from the Commission." The EIPD filing notes that the four companies have five days to file an appeal of the order, and can have a hearing within 15 days if they do. The SEC then has a further 10 days to resolve or reject the appeal; otherwise the cease-and-desist will be automatically lifted. Calata and the four companies may be able to resume the token sale if they register with the SEC and receive a license to sell securities in the country.

coindesk	pipe-dreams-bitcoin-wont-solve-pot-industrys-banking-problem	Pipe Dreams: Bitcoin Won't Solve Pot Industry's Banking Problem - CoinDesk	2017-11-11T14:00	Charles Alovisetti is a senior associate and co-chair of the corporate department at Vicente Sederberg LLC, and works with legal cannabis businesses in the U.S. In this opinion piece, Alovisetti warns such enterprises to be wary of using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a solution to the pot industry's continued difficulty obtaining or keeping bank accounts (a familiar problem for blockchain startups.) One of the major challenges facing legal marijuana businesses is lack of consistent access to banking services. Many marijuana businesses do have banking accounts, but the sword of Damocles dangles above them, always threatening an unappealable termination of an account. Enter digital currencies, which promise an end run around a wary financial system. There is a great deal of excitement in the marijuana industry about the possibilities regarding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But before the cannabis industry gets carried away with images of marijuana businesses sidestepping hostile federal banking regulators, we need to take a hard look at the future of digital currencies. Alternative prescriptions One strategy that's been pushed is for cannabis businesses to take an existing digital currency and simply use it as a method of transacting business to avoid the need to rely on banks. This way, marijuana companies without bank accounts could eliminate the need to operate in cash, instead accepting payment directly from customers or other businesses in digital currency – although converting digital currency into dollars will still require a bank account. Another possible use of digital currencies would be to develop a new token, often referred to as an app coin, protocol token, or altcoin, specifically for the marijuana industry. Again, the goal would be to reduce or eliminate the use of cash and integrate blockchain technology into the compliance and other needs of marijuana businesses. Finally, some business offer bitcoin-based payment processing services. These services allow customers to purchase bitcoin via a credit or debit card and then purchase a marijuana product with the recently acquired bitcoin. The store then converts the bitcoin back into dollars. The idea is to provide an alternative to traditional payment processing services and credit card companies that will not work with marijuana businesses. Harsh realities However, regulators present a real and present threat to cryptocurrencies as they currently exist; for example, recent Chinese regulatory restrictions have seen the closure of platforms allowing people to buy or sell tokens. And these threats become even more important for digital currencies servicing marijuana-related businesses ("MRBs" in the parlance of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or FinCEN). As longtime CoinDesk readers will recall, in March 2013, FinCEN published its initial guidance on virtual currencies. The agency defined three categories of participants: users, exchangers and administrators. A user is "a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services," whereas an exchanger is "a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency" and an administrator is "a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency." FinCEN concluded that, barring any specific exemption, exchangers and administrators are money service businesses (MSBs) and as such are subject to FinCEN registration and the framework of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which was designed to aid FinCEN's investigations of potential criminal activity. Subsequent administrative rulings have clarified that FinCEN considers digital currency exchanges, ATM operators, and payment processors to be exchangers within the agency's tripartite framework. On the marijuana side of the equation, it is important to note that, while marijuana remains illegal federally, the industry in the U.S. exists in its current form because it is tolerated pursuant to federal policy, as set forth in the Cole Memo (put out by the Department of Justice on Aug. 29, 2013). The Cole Memo states that while marijuana remains illegal federally, federal law enforcement should not consider prosecution of state-legal marijuana businesses if those business do not implicate any of eight enumerated enforcement priorities (e.g. preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises and preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or illegal activity). A potent brew While it is unfair to associate all digital currency use with illicit activity, there is a perception, reinforced by certain bad actors, that digital currencies are being used to launder money, divert revenue to criminal enterprises and traffic illicit drugs. Any risk that a business could be seen as violating the Cole Memo priorities needs to be treated extremely seriously as it could provoke a federal law enforcement action. While the Cole Memo addressed violations of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), it was silent as to financial crimes that would inevitably result from the use or banking of proceeds of a federally illegal activity. In response to financial institutions' concerns regarding accepting MRBs as clients, on Feb. 14, 2014, in two memos often referred to as the "Valentine's Day Letters," the Department of Justice and FinCEN each outlined their respective attitudes to money laundering concerns related to the violations of the CSA. The FinCEN memo contained detailed guidelines on how to provide banking services to an MRB while remaining compliant with the BSA. These guidelines included the obligation to file different types of suspicious activity reports (SARs) in response to activity on the part of an MRB. The new DOJ memo updated the earlier Cole Memo to extend the realm of non-priority violations to include provisions of the money laundering statutes, the unlicensed money remitter statute and the BSA triggered by underlying violations of the CSA. But the DOJ reiterated that any exercise of discretion regarding its resources was subject to the provision of services to an MRB whose activities do not trigger any of the eight priority factors. The DOJ also noted that following the FinCEN guidance was critical to remaining within the low enforcement priority category of the Cole Memo. Again, FinCEN has also made it clear BSA compliance obligations also apply to many businesses dealing in digital currencies – exchanges, ATM operators and payment processors are all required to register as MSBs. That means that to comply with the Cole Memo and FinCEN's marijuana policy guidance, any digital currency business that is required to register as an MSB must make the required SAR reports outlined in the Feb. 14, 2014, FinCEN guidance. Just say no When it comes to marijuana firms using cryptocurrencies, discretion should remain the better part of valor. The marijuana industry in the U.S. exists solely due to permissive federal policies that require businesses to follow certain guidelines, including filings SARs with FinCEN. If these guidelines are not being followed to the letter, which is a challenging and sometimes onerous task, a business is no longer within the guidance of the Cole Memo and is at higher risk of facing federal law enforcement action. And even if these guidelines are religiously adhered to, while FinCEN-compliant use of digital currencies is not explicitly prohibited by federal policy, their use is sometimes linked by law enforcement with money laundering, illicit drug sales and other illegal activities. As these crimes are listed as prevention priorities in the Cole Memo, digital currency use could potentially provide an excuse for Attorney General Jeff Sessions (no fan of legal marijuana) to crack down on state-legal pot enterprises.

coindesk	quebec-lures-cryptocurrency-miners-china-sours-industry	Quebec Lures Cryptocurrency Miners as China Sours on Industry - CoinDesk	2018-01-10T05:00	Quebec was fishing for tech giants but caught bitcoin miners. At least that’s how David Vincent, business development director at electric utility Hydro Quebec, describes the results of a campaign launched in 2016 to lure the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft to build their data centers in the Canadian province. The sales pitch was simple: the province offers plentiful, cheap and renewable electricity, along with cold weather and a politically stable environment. And while Hydro Quebec has gotten plenty of bites from traditional data center operators, the company also quickly discovered those same traits are equally attractive for cryptocurrency mining operations. Nonexistent just six months ago, interest in Quebec from commercial-scale bitcoin miners has skyrocketed, Vincent said, amid the surge in cryptocurrency prices and political uncertainty in other jurisdictions. For Hydro Quebec, 35 cryptocurrency mining organizations are asking the company for information regarding connecting to the power grid there. Those companies now account 70 percent of the total wattage capacity in Hydro Quebec's development pipeline. In an interview with CoinDesk, Vincent said: “I have so much demand right now there’s no need for marketing. Pretty much every day I have a new one.” And sentiments from others suggest what Hydro Quebec is seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg. "Based on what I've seen in equipment purchase, real estate and power deals, things are exploding in Quebec," said Austin Hill, the former CEO of Blockstream, who is now investing in and backing some of the mining projects looking to Quebec. Cheap and abundant Cryptocurrency mining – the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain – generally requires specialized hardware (either ASICs or GPUs) to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Because of the vast amount of computing power that's used, mining rigs generate a significant amount of heat, which is why mining operations look for colder environments to set up shop. But it's not only the cold weather that's a draw for Quebec. The government's aggressive effort, during the post World War II era, to build dams in its northern regions has proven enticing enough to pull mining operators away from existing bases that already have weather on their side. Because of that work, Quebec has become one of the largest hydroelectric power producers in the world. Hydro Electric, with 37,000 megawatts of installed electricity capacity, routinely produces at surplus levels and is thus able to offer some of the lowest rates in North America to its commercial customers. For data centers, Hydro Quebec charges as low 2.48 cents (in USD) per kilowatt hour, and 3.94 cents per kilowatt-hour for bitcoin miners (the slight increase for the latter due to mining operations' smaller job creation and economic development footprint), Vincent said. These rates are anywhere from 50 percent to three times lower than in comparable parts of North America, according to data compiled by Hydro Quebec. Historical consistency in pricing over time, and the assurance that the rates are not simply teasers that will jump overnight, are a key part of the value proposition for cryptocurrency mining operations, Vincent said. He added: "We always succeed at staying below inflation. It’s been like that since 1963 and it’s not going to change." And while some have argued that cryptocurrency mining is environmentally degrading, there's a growing trend by these mining operations toward finding competitive advantage via greater energy efficiency and resource optimization. "In some hotter environments, the current ASIC equipment ends up having a very short shelf life of around six to nine months because it gets so hot, and the cost of cooling it isn’t worth the cost of the equipment," Hill, who heads the Montreal-based Brudder Ventures, said, adding: "It’s just easier to run it super hot, throw it away and buy a new one. It’s hugely wasteful." And moving to cooler climates, like Quebec, could help. Political stability Another driver behind Quebec’s accidental emergence as a cryptocurrency mining hub is that miners are increasingly looking for stable political environments where they can deploy their capital investments and plan their business efforts four to five years in advance with a higher degree of confidence. While several of Hydro Quebec's interested parties are based in North America, a significant number of mining organizations hail from countries, notably China, where the landscape for cryptocurrency mining, and cryptocurrencies in general, has become cloudier. In China, for instance, rumors have been surfacing that the government plans on withdrawing preferential benefits such as cheap electricity and tax deductions to bitcoin mining operations. Plus, the People's Bank of China has been one of the more aggressive regulators in the world when it comes to cryptocurrency, most recently issuing a ban on initial coin offerings and moving to shut down bitcoin exchanges. Notably, Vincent said mining interest in Quebec began to tick upward significantly last fall after these moves by China. He told CoinDesk: "They don’t say it like that, but the fact that the rush of the demand came at pretty much the same time they were having problems in their previous jurisdiction, we could think there was a correlation." These concerns, along with a steady flow of reports about mining equipment seizures, kidnappings and game-playing by corrupt public officials in places like Venezuela, could make setting up shop in places where these risks are minimal more important than ever for mining operators. A good problem While Hydro Quebec is still, admittedly, trying to fully grasp this new class of customers, it’s been more than willing to roll out the welcome mat for them because of the enormity of the requests, not to mention the 24/7 nature of their operations. To show mining operation's scale, Vincent compared them to Hydro Quebec's other customers. Its smallest commercial customers, such as the Montreal Canadiens’ hockey arena, require five megawatts of electricity and a typical data center requires 30 to 60 megawatts. By contrast, "the top-three to top-five miners in world, most of them are talking to us, and the demand that they have right now is around 200 to 300 megawatts," he said. "It’s huge." But with an industry as volatile as cryptocurrency, nothing is fully set in stone, and as a risk-averse, publicly owned utility, Hydro Quebec is minimizing its exposure by requiring miners to foot the upfront cost of the power connection and arrange a line of credit from a third party large enough to offset any losses in the event of something dire. "The question for us is: is this a trend that will continue to stay at least as strong as it is right now?" Vincent said. But for now, the biggest problem facing Hydro Quebec is finding enough buildings and locations that are suitable to be used as mining farms, as well as hiring more people who can help meet all of the requests from these types of potential clients, as quickly as they are coming in. "[The miners] have this impression that they’re losing money every day, so they’re asking for big buildings with big interconnections and they want it tomorrow," Vincent said, concluding: "We have the capacity, but we’re not used to having so much big demand like this. It’s a good problem to have."

coindesk	questions-regulation-taxation-loom-crypto-investors	Regulation, Taxation Loom Over Crypto Investors - CoinDesk	2017-11-30T13:00	The legacy of the W.J. Howey Company lives on, though not in a way the owners of the Florida citrus grove would have likely envisioned. Seven decades after its legal battles with the SEC, the company has been enshrined with near legendary status in the cryptocurrency space, as the investment contract test every initial coin offering token is being judged by. "Many of us lawyers studied this Howey case when we were in law school, and we couldn’t have, in our wildest dreams, imagined going into a room like this where it could be recited like it’s the Pledge of Allegiance," joked Lewis Cohen, a partner with Hogan Lovells, during a legal panel Tuesday at Consensus: Invest in New York. As the world of cryptocurrencies and ICOs continues to race ahead, the lingering questions the test elicits in the ICO community about how these tokens will fit within existing legal and regulatory frameworks remains the elephant in the room. Perhaps the most pressing question is whether there is a distinction to be made between tokens that function as securities and those that have a broader utility for a future platform. In that regard, the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens ( SAFT ) framework, which sought to advance the dialogue of what a two-tiered token sale that separates the primary and secondary markets might look like, has received a good deal of optimism. But yesterday at the conference, multiple speakers poured cold water on the concept and suggested a return to the drawing board. Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of blockchain startup Bloq, said: "I’m not a huge fan of [SAFT]. I think trying to hermetically seal that pre-ICO financing is not as democratized and open as you’d like it to be." 'Too many hands' But regulatory uncertainties in the space extend well beyond the SEC. Numerous agencies at the federal level are still determining their approaches toward these new assets, and with additional state authorities likely to get in on the action, jurisdictional complications could make the space even more confusing, argued Gary DeWaal, special counsel with Katten Muchin Rosenman LP. DeWaal explained: "Too many hands in the pot are never a good thing for the development of an asset class." Especially since many regulators are under inaccurate impressions about tokenized assets, according to Lee Schneider, a partner at Will McDermott & Emery. He noted that many are making the mistake of juxtaposing the existence of liquidity with whether or not the underlying asset meets the definition of a commodity or a security. "The nature of the token is hugely important here. You can’t divorce the regulation of the thing from what it is just because you’ve digitized it," he said, adding that he's been pushing back against these misperceptions. Taxation is … coming Another legal gray area within the cryptocurrency space relates to taxation, and with the price of bitcoin eclipsing $10,000 per coin Tuesday, the IRS will be paying greater attention in the coming year. "If you hold large positions and you’ve been moving in and out of a lot of these tokens and coins, the IRS is probably going to start digging into this stuff," said Kelsey Lemaster, a partner specializing in taxation at Goodwin Procter. And the advent of ICOs only complicates matters further, as the IRS has not issued guidance there, but according to Lemaster, investing in an ICO token is most likely a taxable event. "I’m sure it’s not reported in 99 percent of transactions, but I’m sure that’s what the IRS would say," he contends. But the taxation issue could become more manageable as a slew of cryptocurrency-focused tax software products, including a new app rolled out by Libra, are beginning to hit the market. Such products, which look to bring automated tools to traders instead of them having to manually input data into Excel spreadsheets, better enable traders acting in good faith to comply with IRS requirements, and could springboard cryptocurrency activity. On why tax tools are so important, Jeremy Drane, chief commercial officer at Libra, said: "At some point in time, you reach a level of complexity in your operations where you can’t scale."

coindesk	r3-microsoft-expand-partnership-to-boost-corda-dlt-adoption	R3, Microsoft Expand Partnership to Boost Corda DLT Adoption - CoinDesk	2017-11-21T11:00	Distributed ledger technology (DLT) firm R3 is moving to more deeply integrate its Corda platform with Microsoft's Azure cloud service. With the expanded partnership, announced yesterday, the two companies plan to offer "effortless deployment" of Corda and its networks on Azure, easing the process of setting up Corda nodes and networks for enterprises, and thus limiting the time and costs involved in deployment, a press release states. According to David Rutter, CEO of R3, the deeper integration simplifies the "development and deployment process," and facilitates the commercial deployment of R3's CorDapp applications. Rutter continued: "The platform gives companies complete freedom to develop and deploy innovative DLT-based solutions to their customers' specific challenges." With the move, Microsoft is allowing clients to focus on creating "real-world business solutions, applications and pilots," Peggy Johnson, executive vice president at Microsoft, said. R3, a DLT consortium startup with over 100 enterprise members, first announced its partnership with Microsoft in April last year. The deal provides consortium members access to 45 cloud-based tools on its Azure platform, over and above Microsoft's blockchain-as-a-service offerings.

coindesk	rapper-50-cent-now-bitcoin-millionaire	Rapper 50 Cent Is Now a Bitcoin Millionaire - CoinDesk	2018-01-24T19:30	Rapper 50 Cent's move to accept bitcoin for his 2014 "Animal Ambition" album has resulted in a multi-million dollar windfall. On Tuesday, celebrity gossip site TMZ reported that 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, had garnered about 700 BTC after moving to accept the cryptocurrency for the album. At the time, the rapper was accepting payments through processor startup BitPay. At the time, that amount was worth about $400k, and by the publication's estimation, his holdings are now worth somewhere between $7 million and $9 million. The performance artist has confirmed the TMZ article, posting its text to Instagram and writing: "Not Bad for a kid from South Side, I'm so proud of me." In a comment on the social media site, he claimed that he had forgotten about the cache of bitcoin in the years since the Animal Ambition move. Jackson has a history of entrepreneurial success, most famously as an early investor in Glaceau, which Coca-Cola later acquired for $4.1 billion. He has an extensive portfolio that includes a clothing line, dietary supplements and real estate among other things. Yet he made waves by taking the step to accept bitcoin for the album, joining the ranks of other musicians who in past years have made similar moves. That year, for example, rock group Mastodon similarly started taking bitcoin via BitPay, and in November of last year, Icelandic singer Bjork revealed that her "Utopia" album would be available to buyers using multiple cryptocurrencies. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPay.

coindesk	report-founders-fund-boasts-hundred-million-dollar-return-with-bitcoin-bet	Report: Peter Thiel's Founders Fund Bets Millions on Bitcoin - CoinDesk	2018-01-02T22:00	Founders Fund, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm known for its early investment in Facebook, is stepping into the world of cryptocurrencies, according to a new report. Co-founded by high-profile investor Peter Thiel and based in San Francisco, Founders Fund has bought $15 million to $20 million worth of bitcoin across several of its recent funds, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing anonymous sources. Although it is not entirely clear when the transactions were made or whether the firm has now sold any of its digital assets, the report said one of the funds began the investment as early as mid-2017. As such, the firm now reportedly touts hundreds of millions of dollars in returns for its investors. Good timing According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, bitcoin mostly remained around $2,000 to $3,000 from May to July in 2017 but saw a strong growth over the past six months, having reached an all-time high at nearly $20,000 in December. However, the news may not be entirely surprising given the billionaire co-founder of PayPal's previous support for the world's first cryptocurrency. As reported by CoinDesk, Thiel was quoted in October of last year saying he believes the critics of bitcoin are "underestimating" the cryptocurrency and that bitcoin is like gold – meaning it has more potential as a long-term store of value than as an everyday payment method.

coindesk	report-pboc-quashes-rumor-it-would-shutter-chinas-bitcoin-mines	Report: PBoC Quashes Bitcoin Mining Ban Rumor in China - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T17:00	The People's Bank of China has put to rest a rumor that it would order a domestic shutdown of bitcoin mining activities, according to a local media outlet. The report, published on Jan. 4 by the Chinese business publication Caixin, said that China's central bank did not host any meetings to discuss a policy requiring the closure of bitcoin mining operations in the country by a certain deadline. The meeting had supposedly taken place on Jan. 3. However, Caixin's report, which did not identify its sources, indicates that top regulators in China are planning to withdraw preferential benefits such as tax deductions and cheap electricity supplies available to bitcoin mining companies. This means the government's current stance on bitcoin mining is to neither encourage nor hamper such activities. This change is the latest move from Chinese regulators in the cryptocurrency industry after previously issuing a ban on initial coin offering and tightening restrictions on crypto exchanges. According to the report, the rumor first emerged through a photo on the WeChat messaging platform that purportedly showed Guo Hongcai, a notable and active investor in the bitcoin industry in China, claiming there would be a ban. Guo later said that this image was fake through his WeChat account. Despite his disavowal, a Chinese bitcoin blog, 45-block, published a report that the PBoC was discussing a ban on bitcoin mining. The same report also said the central bank would soon require government bodies at different levels to survey and report on the number and locations of bitcoin mining facilities within their territories in an effort to shut down such activities. The claim was significant given that China currently accounts for nearly 70 percent of the global hash power in bitcoin, a computing capacity that is crucial to solve the mathematical function to mine the cryptocurrency. However, upon inquiries, Bixin and ViaBTC, two cryptocurrency mining pools based in China, told CoinDesk over WeChat messages that they had received no information regarding the issue from regulators. Neither pool otherwise commented on the issue.

coindesk	report-south-korea-to-decide-thursday-on-crypto-exchange-regulation	Report: South Korea Could Decide This Week on Crypto Exchange Regulation - CoinDesk	2018-01-18T06:30	South Korea could make a decision on Thursday over its stance on cryptocurrency exchange regulation, according to a report by Reuters. Responding to a parliament member at the national policy committee meeting today, Choi Jong-ku, head of South Korea's Financial Services Commission, explained how such regulation may play out, reportedly saying: “(The government) is considering both shutting down all local virtual currency exchanges or just the ones who have been violating the law.” The comment indicates the government is moving to clear the recent confusion around cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea, mainly created by conflicting comments issued by different government bodies. As reported before, on Jan. 11, the South Korean Ministry of Justice reportedly confirmed a plan to shut down all cryptocurrency exchanges. Yet soon the South Korea's Presidential Office commented that such a policy has not been finalized. As reported by CoinDesk previously, the unclear situation has also brought backlash from local residents and politicians. According to the report, Hong Nam-ki, minister of the office for government policy coordination, said while government officials still hold different opinions over the issue, the meeting today expects to reach a decision on a cryptocurrency exchange regulation. Elsewhere in the country today, South Korea's central bank made a comment that may signal a different approach on how the country may make use of cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. According to Reuters, Lee Ju-yeol, governor of Bank of Korea said in a news conference on Thursday that while cryptocurrency so far is not a legal currency, the bank has been involved in researching a central bank-issued cryptocurrency. "We have started looking at virtual currency from a long-term standpoint, as central banks could start issuing digital currencies in the future. This sort of research has begun at the Bank of International Settlements and we are part of that research," he said. South Korea flag image via CoinDesk's archive.

coindesk	review-brawker-lets-buy-almost-anything-bitcoin	Review: Brawker Let's You Buy 'Almost Anything' with Bitcoin	2014-12-24T15:51	Name: Brawker What it is: Brawker is a site that offers discount shopping at all legitimate web retailers. The firm says users can buy "almost anything" online with bitcoin. It also enables people to semi-anonymously purchase bitcoin by shopping for others with their credit/debit cards or PayPal. Who’s behind it: Co-founder and CEO Cyril Houri previously founded Infosplit, the first company to provide geolocation based on IP address, and Navizon, a firm specialising in wireless geolocation. He designed and patented some of the technology that is now commonly used to geolocate website visitors. He remains chairman of Navizon. Cost: 1% of transaction for each of the two parties. Date launched: April 2014. Summary: Brawker provides a very useful service for those who want to spend their bitcoins online. It's easy to use, but it is a lengthy process, so not ideal for the time-strapped. CoinDesk rating: 4/5 The basics Brawker is an online marketplace that matches people who want to buy bitcoin with others who want to purchase items online with bitcoin and gain a discount for doing so. To sum it up as simply as possible, Alice, say, has seen a $50 scarf online and wants to buy it using bitcoin, but the site doesn’t accept payment in digital currency. On Brawker, a user called Bob is willing to buy the scarf for Alice, in return for her bitcoins. And because he can buy bitcoins with a credit/debit card or PayPal without having to register his ID and address with an exchange, he is willing to pay a premium for those coins. Alice wants a discount of 10% on the price of the scarf, therefore she pays Bob $45 in bitcoin and he pays $50 for the scarf, which is delivered to her. Both parties have a need fulfilled by the service that can be hard or impossible to find elsewhere. An overview of how Brawker works Using the service In the interests of ensuring the service works as claimed, I tested it out from start to finish. Placing an order I registered with Brawker using a username, an email address and a password. No ID or proof of address was required, since Brawker claims it doesn’t have to observe know-your-customer (KYC) requirements as it is not a financial institution. Next, I visited an online store that doesn’t currently accept bitcoin and selected an item – a bottle of sloe gin, which cost £29.90 including delivery – and copied the URL of the page the item was listed on. Note, Brawker sets no official maximum on the price of a purchase, but the service is commonly used to purchase items priced under $1,000 due to limits set by the credit card companies. Back on Brawker, I pasted the URL, entered the item price (including postage and any taxes) and my delivery address. Using an Amazon wishlist for the purchase comes with the additional feature of hiding personal details from the buyer. At this point, I was asked to select a discount rate. Discounts generally range from 0–20%, as above that point there is little incentive for bidders to take up the offer. I opted for a relatively low proposed discount of 5% to encourage users to accept my order without delay. Theoretically, this could have been the start of a bidding war between multiple bitcoin buyers, who can make counter offers until both parties are happy with the discount rate. For the sake of speed, however, I accepted the first offer at my proposed 5% from user ‘gmajoulet’. Paying with bitcoin The exchange rate between the buyer's currency and bitcoin is determined using figures from bitcoinaverage.com. I sent the equivalent of £28.40 in bitcoin to a multi-signature address that acts as an escrow between gmajoulet and me. Behind the scenes, there were three keys (in effect, passwords) to the escrow address I was provided with: one held by Brawker, one held by me and the other held by gmajoulet. All three are encrypted and two of the three keys are needed to finalise a transaction. Brawker holding the third key means the company can release the funds to either party at the resolution of any possible dispute. Brawker stores neither users' fiat currency nor bitcoin. The company told CoinDesk that all transactions occur "directly on the blockchain, as opposed to being off-chain transactions on our servers". As a result, the company claims users' funds cannot be hacked through their service, as users are in charge of their own private keys. Awaiting delivery In my Brawker dashboard, I could see my bitcoin funds waiting to be released. Soon after, the bidder paid for the order and uploaded the payment confirmation email as proof of purchase. Once the gin arrived safely, all that remained was to notify Brawker of the delivery, which enabled the bidder's bitcoins to be released from escrow. The entire process was completed in four days, the bulk of which was taken up with waiting for delivery. I had no problem with my order, but should that have been the case, there is a 'File a claim' button on the site, which starts a dispute process arbitrated by Brawker and based on the information provided by both parties (including payment confirmation, tracking number and so on). Depending on the outcome of the dispute, Brawker would either refund my bitcoins or pass them on to the bidder. At the end of the process I was asked to rate gmajoulet and vice versa. These ratings are tracked on the public profile of each Brawker user, similar to eBay’s rating system, and give future users of the service an idea of how reliable the individual is. Pros Setting up an order is a relatively simple affair taking perhaps 20 minutes for someone with a little experience with bitcoin transactions. Clean, user-friendly website interface. Useful updates sent via email at every stage of the process helped keep track of what needed to be done to keep the transaction moving smoothly along. Brawker enables digital currency enthusiasts to pay for items and services previously only available to customers holding fiat currency. Bitcoiners can pay for items ranging from groceries to electricity bills and parking tickets to student loan repayments, bringing the possibility of living solely on bitcoin closer to reality. Cons May not be so simple to use for a complete newcomer to bitcoin due to the slight rigamarole of using QR codes and bitcoin wallets to send and receive funds. However, most users are likely to have some experience. Users need to monitor the process regularly so as to be able to accept offers, upload funds to escrow, etc. You can't just set an order and wait, regardless. What if a 15-year-old tried to buy the same item with bitcoin, or a gun? Does this open up inappropriate products up to youngsters? The company says its aim is not to enable the purchase of items that wouldn't have been available to buyers otherwise and claims its policy is to remove items that have territorial or age restrictions, such as guns and alcohol (it also claims items made available via the Tor network are blocked). However, this obviously isn’t working, as I just purchased a bottle of gin without an age check. See a video of how to use an Amazon wishlist to place an order: Competitors A service very similar to that offered by Brawker is Purse.io, but this is currently limited to shopping on Amazon. Gift cards are another option for consumers wanting to spend their bitcoins. Companies such as eGifter, Gyft and Pockio let customers purchase digital gift cards with bitcoin (and sometimes other cryptocurrencies) and then spend those cards at sites like Amazon, iTunes, Spotify and many others. However, unlike Brakwer and Purse.io, these services offer no discounts to users – cards are redeemed on the retailer sites at face value. Conclusion The successfully delivered product Overall, the ability to use bitcoin at any online store is a huge step forward and the potential discounts offer an extra incentive to shop with bitcoin over credit/debit cards or PayPal. The service is also useful for those who want to buy bitcoin with their credit card – especially for those that do not want to have to register with ID and proof of address at an exchange. However, they must be prepared to go through the Brawker marketplace process to get their digital currency and put up with the delay encountered with waiting for the item to be delivered. The multisig technology, while making the service more secure and allowing a fair system for refunds in the event of a dispute, did not make the process noticeably more complex than a user would expect with a standard login procedure. I should point out, however, that buying bitcoin with a card – something that used to be rare due to the possibility of chargebacks – is becoming increasingly common through companies like Coinbase, Circle and CoinCorner, among others, and the attractive discounts may not be maintainable in the long term. Even so, Brawker’s service frees up people to spend their bitcoins where they like – a vital step if bitcoin is ever to go mainstream. This is a service that is of benefit to individual bitcoiners and the community as a whole. What's not to like? Disclaimer : This article represents the experience of the reviewer.

coindesk	review-getgems-ios-app-review	Review: GetGems iOS App Glitters But It's Still Seeking Gold	2015-05-05T18:18	Name of product: GetGems. What it is: Mobile messaging app with built-in, bitcoin-based incentivization token. Made by: GetGems. Who’s behind it: Israeli developer Daniel Peled, with $400,000 in strategic investment from Magma VC and $780,000 raised in its initial crowdsale. Cost: Free to download. Date launched: 29th April 2015. Basic summary: GetGems is a decentralized social messaging app built on open-source software provided by popular encrypted messenger Telegram. The app allows users to send and receive both bitcoin (BTC) and its native digital token, GEMZ. Billed as "the first messaging app that pays you", users earn GEMZ by helping to grow the network, with rewards of 25 GEMZ given for every referral that generates a new participant. Additionally, 27,500 GEMZ are distributed to users daily, with users receiving a part of this amount proportional to the number of users they have invited to the network. As the app is updated, users will have more ways to earn, including viewing in-app ads. A token created on top of the Counterparty protocol, GEMZ are currently traded on exchanges such as BTER and Poloniex at a press time value of $0.01 per GEMZ. CoinDesk Rating: 3/5 The basics After downloading the iOS app, GetGems launches with an animation that showcases one of the messaging service's biggest strengths – its visual appeal. Before users can explore, however, there is a somewhat lengthy sign-up process. Users first provide their name and profile picture and choose whether to allow the app to send push notifications or access their contacts. Next, a wallet PIN number is set and confirmed, a feature that is used to safeguard consumers from sending unwanted transactions. GetGems then asks users to name who invited them to the service, should this be applicable. As part of this referral program, the individual would receive a referral award in GEMZ. Using the service While GetGems is a redesign of the Telegram messenger in most respects, the novel features of the GetGems app are its built-in bitcoin and GEMZ wallets. For example, by typing '1 GEMZ' or '0.01 BTC' in the messenger, users are able to quickly transfer value. After typing any value, the 'Send' button will change to a GetGems or bitcoin logo, which when tapped will execute the payment. This exchange does not work at present if users send added text as part of the message. Users can toggle between BTC and GEMZ, displaying the value held in each of their GetGems wallets. Clicking on the paper airplane image in the top right allows users to send money by pasting a bitcoin or GetGetms wallet address or by displaying a QR code. On trial, we sent 0.0002 BTC over the app to a Circle address, the amount of which was quickly detected by the bitcoin blockchain and the wallet provider. Security The GetGems app has a simple payments verification (SPV) client built in, meaning the wallet can access the bitcoin network through 'full' trusted nodes rather than connecting directly. According to the company, this removes the need for trusted servers while maintaining fast performance on mobile devices. For privacy conscious users, it should be noted GetGems controls user private keys for in-app wallet addresses, crediting users for GEMZ that have been deposited. This makes transfers instant, but requires them to be completed off of the bitcoin blockchain. Password resets are also not allowed, as private keys are derived from the password. The passphrase for accessing the wallet is encrypted locally on the device, meaning that funds can be spent only if both the phone and the PIN are compromised by bad actors. Further, after several failed attempts to guess the PIN, the server will lock the account and prevent decryption. Going forward, GetGems is seeking to enable users to hold multiple GEMZ wallets on the app, a feature requested by larger crowdsale participants, and create a desktop application. Pros Intuitive messenger allows easy BTC and GEMZ exchange. Notification options allow wide range of customizations. Passphrase recovery feature guards against phone loss. Straightforward wallet system for external BTC and GEMZ transfers. Strong visual elements and appeal. Cons Infrequent glitches and crashes. Inability to purchase GEMZ in app. Telegram users receive messages sent on GetGems. Conclusion Armed with a vibrant pink display, GetGems evokes a playful tone that arguably helps encourage users to overcome some of the app's less intuitive features. This sense of discovery propels past issues such as balances that were slow to update or sudden, unexpected crashes or glitches. The best case for adding GetGems to your iPhone may be to consider the product as a functional social wallet, one that brings you together with other bitcoin users who may be using Blockchain, Coinbase or Circle in an easy and intuitive way, while rewarding you with a secondary set of tokens. However, the biggest hurdle for GetGems to overcome will be establishing consumer behavior in the way that it envisions. Should users fail to see any value in exchanging bitcoin while they message, it will be difficult for GetGems, or any competitor, to encourage your social circle to stick around. Update 20:00 UTC, 5th May: GetGems has indicated that it has since responded to initial crash reports in the days after launch, updating the platform to resolve these errors.

coindesk	review-haasbot-automated-trading	Review: Haasbot 2.0 Brings Automated Trading to the Next Level	2015-01-24T17:31	Name: Haasbot 2.0 What is it: Haasbot is a sophisticated bitcoin trading bot suite designed primarily for bitcoin trading professionals, but amateur traders and hobbyists could find it useful too. Who’s behind it: Haasbot started life as a personal project created by Stephan de Haas, but eventually the small team behind the bot decided to commercialise their product. The core team includes de Haas, lead developer and founder of Haasonline; marketing manager Phil Donsbach; developer Lander Vanhaverbeke; and support specialist Theo Goodman. Cost: Haasbot 2.0 is available in three different pricing tiers. Haasonline uses a subscription-based model. A three-month 'Beginner' licence costs 0.22 BTC, the 'Simple' licence is priced at 0.30 BTC, while the full 'Advanced' licence costs 0.45 BTC. The company also offers 6- and 12-month licences. Payments in fiat currency are not accepted. Product Launched: January 2015. Summary: Haasbot 2.0 provides users with a wide range of choice, with three basic bots, all of which feature a number of different presets, as well as a range of user-customisable options. Depending on the licence, users can set up several interconnected bots capable of performing a range of different functions. CoinDesk rating: 4.5/5 The Basics While Haasbot is a relatively familiar name in some circles, bitcoin users may not have heard of it. It is a niche software solution for bitcoin traders rather than mainstream users, a professional tool for people that know what they are doing. In its latest incarnation, Haasbot 2.0 offers a number of new features, but the big news is the entirely reworked user interface (UI) that should improve user experience over 1.x versions. The basic functionality remains unchanged and Haasbot 2.0 still offers three types of standard bot: Trade, Arbitrage and Maximum Order. Trade bots are supported by a range of technical analysis indicators, safeties and insurances. The 2.0 update also brings customisable Script bots and other new features. The Advanced licence enables users to create an unlimited number of bots and use all available safeties, insurances and indicators. The Simple licence is limited to three bots from each category for a total of nine bots, while the Beginner licence supports two bots from each category, allowing the user to create a total of six bots. Beginner and Simple licences also offer a limited choice of safeties, indicators and insurances on trade bots. The team also claims transparency and prides itself on providing support via forums and a wiki page, as well as integrating some features requested by users. Haasbot 2.0 currently supports Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e, CEX-IO, Cryptsy, Huobi, Kraken and a few smaller exchanges. Users can track prices on one exchange while trading on another, so if they spot a trend on one particular exchange, they can gain ahead start on another exchange. Using the service As mentioned, Haasbot 2.0 is not aimed at mainstream bitcoin users. The target audience is people who understand the markets and trading. However, this does not mean that Haasbot 2.0 is not user-friendly and cannot be used by hobby traders. As always the caveat is, do not trade with any coins you are not prepared to lose. With three different licence tiers, three standard bot classes and a practically countless combinations of safeties, indicators and insurances that can be assigned to individual bots, getting to grips with Haasbot 2.0 could be problematic for users who have no previous experience with trading bots. This is one of the reasons Haasonline maintains a very comprehensive wiki, complete with detailed guides, walkthroughs and other useful resources. There’s also a support forum for user inquiries, suggestions and more. The sheer number of options also means that we could not test every scenario in any sensible timeframe. Haasbot 2.0 is a professional trading tool and we simply could not cover the full functionality. Installation and setup The new 2.0 update brings a complete overhaul of the UI and an all-new web server interface. The installation process is relatively straightforward and the developers recommend Google’s Chrome browser as the best platform for the Haasbot Trade Server. Once that is installed, it is just a matter of entering licence and API information and you are ready to start trading. With Haasbot 2.0, you easily keep track of all active bots and set up various notifications, straight from your browser, using a convenient dashboard. The only downside is that mobile functionality remains limited, so if you happen to be on the road you may have a harder time managing your bots. Creating trade bots, order bots and arbitrage bots is just as easy, it’s a one-click affair, but setting them up and tweaking all the parameters may take a while. Effectively, it all depends on what you want your bots to do – and when. Script bots are an entirely new feature introduced with Haasbot 2.0 and they are completely customisable and programmable in C#. They do, however, require a bit more time and knowledge to set up. The latest update also brings a new price comparison feature, along with a white server framework for more accurate and faster price tracking. Haasbot 2.0 also comes with three new trade indicators: Elliot prediction, Fibonacci and IchiClouds, and is now available in English, German and Dutch languages. Types of available bots Haasbot 2.0 offers three basic bot categories, configurable out of the box. Trade bots use a combination of indicators, safeties and insurances selected by the user to act as a buy or sell signal. The signal is cross-referenced with the current position and the trade is executed if all criteria are met. The bot will also consider the insurances created by the user, as well as safeties. The most frequently used safeties are Dynamic Drop Loss and Static Drop Loss, which monitor prices for a sudden drop and trigger trades based on thresholds set by the user. A wide range of indicators is available, depending on the type of licence you choose. The most popular insurance is ‘Overcome Fees’, which ensures that trades are not executed unless the profit is greater than the fee. Order bots operate depending on a number of conditions or pre-orders. A number of conditions can be combined in a single bot to create customised bots, allowing traders to emulate support and resistance levels. Arbitrage bots can be employed on exchanges with multiple currency pairs, allowing the trader to generate a profit through exchange rate variations. In such a scenario, the bot is configured to use a base currency and then monitors price differences related to the base currency, allowing automated low-risk transactions. Configuring bots There are myriad ways to configure bots, allowing users to create very elaborate strategies, such as virtually interconnecting bots and setting up bots that can automatically take over from less profitable bots in certain scenarios. Of course, this involves significant planning, along with some level of trial and error. 'Backtesting' allows users to see how their trade bots would have performed in action over the last 3 hours to 32 weeks, using historic market data. This feature speeds up the setup and helps remove ambiguities. Backtesting can be used on trading and arbitrage bots. Users can set various indicators to execute buys or sells, or both. Trade signals can be reversed as well. In case your strategy loses money in backtesting, you can simply reverse the indicators and proceed. Script indicators allow traders with programming skills to devise their own completely customised algorithms. To set up an arbitrage bot, the user needs to select a base currency in which profits are to be generated. The bot works with three user-selected currency pairs, such as USD/BTC, USD/LTC and BTC/LTC. In periods of high volatility, the bot will be able to find price differences between the pairs and execute trades. The bot automatically takes fees into considerations and will not trade unless profit covers the fee. Order bots are basically pre-programmed bots allowing users to create buy and sell orders in advance, based on price thresholds. They can also be strung together to form dependencies. Order bots can be dependent on other order bots, ensuring that the most profitable trade is executed. For example, if you have a trade bot set up to sell at $250 and another bot set up to sell at $265, the first bot won’t take action if the second bot is able to sell at a higher price. Let the trading begin Since we are dealing with an automated service, there is really not much to report. Everything works as advertised and the end result depends on what you decide to do with your bots. As you can see, the CoinDesk test bot worked, but did not make a fortune for a number of reasons (limited time and unrealistic setup to name two). Perhaps the biggest change with the Haasbot 2.0 update is the browser interface, which I found user-friendly and relatively simple to use, given the complexity of the suite. It also adds a bit more functionality, allowing users to control their bots with less effort. It is also possible to use a VPS (virtual private server) in order to access the interface on mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks. Pros The new web interface is user-friendly and looks good. It is a big improvement over Haasbot 1.x in terms of appearance and functionality. Wide range of indicators and addition of new ones in 2.0 update, along with new features like script bots. Haasonline tends to keep things personal and is in constant touch with users via its support forum, wiki and direct contact. Developers routinely add features and tweak the platform based on community input, so if you come up with a good idea, the team may well implement it. Cons While the web interface is accessible from mobile devices via VPS, support for mobile devices leaves much to be desired. The company is considering developing iOS and Android apps that would provide vital notifications and allow users to shut down bots on the go. Haasbot 2.0 licences are not cheap. Though this is subjective – depending on how serious you are about trading and how much you are willing to invest, the licences could be either too expensive or a negligible cost considering your potential gains. Once again, this is a specialised platform and it’s not designed for inexperienced users. Competitors There are already a few bitcoin trading bots on the market. Some are free, some offer free trial periods, while others use a subscription-based model. CoinDesk took a closer look at a number of trading bots in a feature last June. These include Butter Bot, CryptoTrader and Acacia Trading, but it’s hard to directly compare the platforms due to a number of reasons. Be that as it may, Haasbot 2.0 tends to offer more functionality than competing solutions, but at a premium price. Conclusion Haasbot 2.0 is more than an incremental update, as it offers a number of new features, namely the all-new web interface. The platform also offers three basic types of bots, along with new script bots that can be customised. The extensive choice of options, safeties, indicators and interactions between the bots allows traders to devise elaborate trading strategies, provided they choose to buy the Advanced licence with no limitations. The downside is the cost of the top-tier licence, but cheaper licences are available too, which means you don’t have to spend much to try the service for a limited time. It should also be noted that Haasonline was forced to increase pricing due to the low price of bitcoin. Remember, the company does not accept fiat payments. However, for serious traders used to trading dozens or hundreds of coins on a regular basis, the Advanced licence at 0.45 BTC for three months probably doesn’t sound like much. Bottom line – Haasonline raised the bar with the Haasbot 2.0 update and the competition has some catching up to do.

coindesk	review-is-the-purse-discount-really-worth-the-hassle	Review: Is Purse's Discount Really Worth the Hassle?	2015-03-13T11:18	Name: Purse What it is: A peer-to-peer marketplace that matches individuals wanting to buy items on Amazon at a discount with others wanting to buy bitcoin with a credit card or via PayPal. The service claims discounts of up to 20% for bitcoin shoppers. Who’s behind it: CEO and co-founder Andrew Lee, previously an advisor for BuyBitcoin.ph and co-founder at Superior Payments Processing LLC, and co-founder and CTO Kent Liu, formerly an engineer at IBM and Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. (See the full team here.) Roger Ver and BTC China's Bobby Lee (also an adviser) are both investors in the company. Cost: I was charged a £0.06 ($0.09) fee for placing an order equivalent to £6.51 ($9.82), or approximately 1%. Date launched: December 2014 Summary: Purse touts hefty discounts for people shopping at Amazon via its service, but time delays and complexity ruin the user experience. Additionally, limits on discounts available for new users lower incentive to use the platform. CoinDesk rating: 2/5 How it works: The service is marketed at people who would like to purchase Amazon items with bitcoin, since the digital currency is currently not accepted by the online retailing giant. The process is similar to other peer-to-peer marketplace such as Brawker, a site that offers discount shopping at all legitimate retailers. Purse acts as an intermediary by facilitating a user platform, bitcoin wallet and escrow for completing transactions. Let's imagine that Alice wants to buy a tablet device from Amazon and get a discount of 8%. In order to do so, she would have to create a wishlist for the item on Amazon and associate it with her delivery address. Alice would then post her wishlist on Purse, with her desired discount, and upload the cost (equivalent to £100, assuming free delivery) in bitcoin to her escrow wallet address on Purse. Bob, meanwhile, would like to buy £100-worth of bitcoin with his credit card. He is prepared to pay a premium to be able to do this without having to register with a bitcoin exchange and provide ID and proof of address, thus covering Alice's 8% discount himself. Bob goes on to purchase the item for Alice from Amazon using his card for £108. Once the item has been delivered to Alice's address, she notifies the Purse platform and her bitcoin is released from escrow and arrives in Bob's wallet. This way, both customers have a need fulfilled by Purse's service. The company makes revenue by charging both parties a small fee. See the company's explanatory video below: Purse Promo Video from PurseIO on Vimeo. Using the service Registering Purse requires users to have an Amazon account. To register on Purse, consumers are required to provide a user name or email address and a password. Once the user has signed up to Purse, he or she will have to create an Amazon wishlist. Amazon automatically creates a wishlist URL, which will need to be imported into Purse. The user will also have to transfer funds from their personal bitcoin wallet into their Purse-hosted wallet. Placing an order Purse enables the user to choose the desired discount of up to 20% once the bitcoin funds have been transferred to its platform. It is important to note, however, that first-time buyers are limited to a maximum discount of 8%. Once the level of discount has been selected, the consumer receives a breakdown of the Amazon total, the fee charged by Purse and the total amount saved. The user can then place the order. Delivery Once the order has been placed and accepted by the bitcoin buyer, the user receives a notification at the email address provided during registration. The bitcoin remains in escrow until the user notifies Purse that the order has been successfully delivered. Reflecting on the process I encountered a series of issues with my order, which comprised of some sticky notes and a pack of ball pens. My order was initially accepted by a buyer, who then rejected it. To try and understand why, I looked on the Purse marketplace page and realised that most smaller offers were still awaiting a buyer. Two days later, I received a notification stating that another buyer had accepted the order. The buyer contacted me to let me know that Amazon was only able to ship part of my order – the sticky notes. I was not entirely sure as to why this was the case, but Purse indicated that it had something to do with not selecting third party shipment on Amazon, which I had, as this is set to default. A 'dispute' was raised for the order, and a tedious exchange of messages between the Amazon buyer, Purse and me began. Purse confirmed that I would receive a partial delivery and that I would be refunded for the undelivered item. I received my order approximately a week after the order was placed and proceeded to confirm the shipment so that I could get my refund. Purse refunded me relatively quickly. However, I was charged a fee of 0.1% for withdrawing my bitcoin back into my Coinbase wallet. I struggled to understand why a service would charge you for withdrawing funds that have previously been refunded to you. However, a spokesperson from Purse said that this was merely the standard miners' fee – awarded for confirming transactions on the bitcoin network – and was not kept by the platform. Overall, despite my order arriving in good condition, I was left wondering if the hassle was really worth it for such a small discount. Pros Purse offers relatively generous discounts to people wanting to buy Amazon items with bitcoin Being able to modify the level of discount to attract buyers is a benefit The service enables you to communicate with a Purse representative and the bitcoin buyer, keeping you updated throughout the process Purse respond to user requests relatively quickly and resolves issues in a timely manner Bitcoin buyers and sellers are able to review each other and award points. Cons It can be difficult to find a buyer for a relatively small order As a basic level user, you are initially limited to a 8% discount, although the front page of the site strongly promotes a figure of 20% The buying process is somewhat convoluted and can be confusing at times Not being able to receive my full order – although this seems to be an issue with Amazon not shipping multiple orders, rather than a problem with Purse The order arrived a full seven days after it was placed and I had to spend a considerable amount of time liaising with the buyer and Purse. I don't feel that the discount obtained justifies the time spent talking to both parties. Competitors Brawker is very similar to the service offered by Purse, but allows shopping at any online retailer (see the CoinDesk review ). Users are also able to spend their bitcoin by purchasing gift cards for e-commerce sites. Companies such as eGifter, Gyft and Gift Off. enable customers purchase digital gift cards with bitcoin (and sometimes other cryptocurrencies) and then spend those cards at sites like Amazon, iTunes, Spotify and many others. However, unlike Brawker and Purse, these services do not currently offer any discounts. Conclusion The delivered product Being able to spend bitcoin at Amazon is a huge step forward for general adoption, and the potential discounts offer an extra incentive to shop with the digital currency rather than credit/debit cards or PayPal. The service is also useful for people who wish to purchase bitcoin with their credit or debit card – especially for those that do not want to register with ID and proof of address at an exchange. While I do not plan to use the service again for smaller orders (the incentive is just not big enough), I would consider doing so for more expensive items where the discount results in a more notable saving. Disclaimer : This article represents the experience of the reviewer. Please do your own extensive research before considering committing any funds to the service.
coindesk	review-ledger-wallet-nano-provides-premium-security-budget	Review: Ledger Wallet Nano Provides Premium Security on a Budget	2014-12-21T17:13	Name: Ledger Wallet Nano What it is: A USB bitcoin wallet with smartcard security in a very compact package. Who's behind it: Three French startups: BTChip, Chronocoin and La Maison du Bitcoin. Cost: €29.90. Date launched: December 2014. Summary: The Ledger Wallet Nano is a relatively affordable bitcoin hardware wallet with a few clever tricks up its sleeve. It also looks good and the company promises to make it even better with a companion mobile app set to launch in 2015. CoinDesk rating: 4/5 Where to buy: Direct from Ledger or Overstock.com The basics Security Using the device Pros Cons Competitors Conclusion The basics The Ledger Wallet Nano is a new hierarchical deterministic multisig hardware wallet for bitcoin users that aims to eliminate a number of attack vectors through the use of a second security layer. This tech-heavy description does not mean much to the average consumer, though, which is why I am going to explain it in plain language, describing what makes the Ledger Wallet Nano tick. The wallet launched in early December and for more background on the project you can catch up on our launch coverage. In terms of hardware, the Ledger Wallet Nano is a compact USB device based on a smartcard. It is roughly the size of a small flash drive, measuring 39 x 13 x 4mm (1.53 x 0.51 x 0.16in) and weighing in at just 5.9g. The box also contains a simple manual, recovery sheet and security card in black faux leather pouch. USB flash drive on the right included for reference I have no major complaints about the build quality, although some rough edges are visible upon closer examination. The plastic device features an aluminium swivel cover with a brushed finish like many USB drives. In fact, the design looks eerily similar to Super Talent's Pico-A series flash drives. Ledger Wallet Nano security concept Ledger's familiar design is where its similarities to traditional USB drives end, though. Since it does not use cheap NAND memory like the average USB drive, the Ledger should be more reliable. The manufacturer of the EEPROM memory used in the CC EAL5+ compliant smartcard offers a 30-year guarantee on data retention and 500,000 read/write cycles. The smartcard has been an industry standard for decades and eliminates a number of security issues that may arise on devices based on multipurpose microcontrollers. The wallet is obviously not designed as a standalone device, as it relies on the host computer to set up and execute transactions. Since the host computer is the most likely point of failure, the Ledger Wallet Nano is designed to render vulnerable or even compromised computers safe, by introducing another layer of security. The wallet signs bitcoin transactions internally and aims to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by employing a security card. Without this added security layer, the wallet would be exposed to MITM attacks, as a hacker could, in theory, gain control of the computer and proceed to compromise the wallet. The security card makes such an attack less likely by providing physical two-factor authentication. No transaction can be signed without human interaction – each transaction requires the user to visually scan the security card when prompted by the wallet app. The wallet displays the payment address and asks the user to enter codes for four random parts of the address. If the right code is not entered, a transaction cannot take place. Security card in lieu of dedicated display The Trezor hardware wallet, which we reviewed a few months ago, employs a screen to tackle this problem, prompting the user to enter the PIN on a pseudo-random numeric pad, visible only to the user. The Ledger team opted for a different approach in the form of a security card with 58 pairs of characters. The basic idea is the same, but the implementation is a bit different. Using a card in place of a screen obviously allows for a smaller device and keeps the overall cost down. The trade-off is that it also results in fewer possible permutations of the second-factor code. A persistent attacker with complete control over the user's PC could in theory reconstruct the security card after a few dozen transactions. Each transaction would provide the attacker with more 'depth' until sufficient information is collected to fully map and reconstruct the contents of the security card. As odd as it may sound, using the wallet on a number of different malware-ridden PCs would, in theory, be safer from an anti-MITM perspective than using it to make a few dozen transactions on your own computer. Ledger is aware of these limitations and is working to develop a mobile companion app that will essentially allow another device to act as a screen for the wallet. The app will be paired to the wallet using the security card, allowing the wallet to display the challenge on the mobile device, along with the target address and amount of BTC. The user will then be able to sign the security challenge and facilitate the transaction. The company plans to release the companion app in January 2015. Using the device The wallet is designed for use on desktop operating systems on Google's Chrome browser. I used an Asus Windows 8.1 tablet with a keyboard dock as the test bed. Installing the Ledger Wallet Nano The installation process is relatively straightforward, but requires the use of a Google Chrome app. The user merely needs to plug in the Ledger Wallet Nano into a USB port and head over to my.ledgerwallet.com to automatically install the Chrome application, which connects to Ledger's API server to access the blockchain. While comparatively popular, Chrome is not the only browser on the market and millions of users still rely on Firefox, Safari and even Internet Explorer. A platform-agnostic approach would have been preferable, but for a number of reasons, including security certificates, it is simply not feasible. Linux users also need to create a set of udev rules to allow access to the device. Once the app is ready, the user is prompted to enter the PIN. The user can choose the PIN or use one suggested by the installer. Then comes the recovery seed – when the wallet is initialised, it generates a 24-word mnemonic seed which must be stored, preferably on the included recovery sheet. Don't try this at home - the seed should be written down and stored safely The seed is displayed only once and must not be stored on your computer, in digital form. The seed is the only way of restoring the wallet in case of loss or hardware failure. This can be done using a replacement Ledger wallet, but the process also works on alternative BIP39 wallets like Electrum. The Ledger Nano must be initialised on an uncompromised computer. One way of doing this is via air gap, using a live OS like Chromium on a USB stick, and the process should not take very long, although it does involve a bit of BIOS tinkering (i.e. changing the boot sequence). In addition to the 24-word recovery phrase, the neatly arranged recovery sheet also includes the security card recovery QR code, which can be used to create a new copy of the second-factor security card in case of loss or theft. If you punch in the wrong PIN three times in a row, the wallet will reset itself to factory condition. This is also the easiest way of wiping the device in case you want to sell or gift it. Using the wallet Once the installation is complete, the user simply needs to insert the device into a USB port and enter the PIN in order to access the wallet. However, all transactions must be validated using the security card. The wallet will issue a challenge and the user needs to follow instructions and enter the four-character code to validate the transaction. This is done by entering the corresponding characters from the security card. The wallet itself is easy to use and anyone familiar with bitcoin wallets should feel at home. The only difference is the added layer of validation with the security card. Fortunately the whole process is simple and fast – usually taking no more than 15-20 seconds per transaction. The wallet also features a QR scanner. Despite the fact that QR scanning has limited applications on desktop platforms, I used it to simulate topping up a mobile wallet and it worked fine. It could be quite a time saver in some situations. Overall there is not much to say about the wallet – and this is a good thing – it's more or less a regular bitcoin wallet with an added layer of authentication, which doesn't take up a lot of time. Pros Very compact and sleek design. The Ledger can fit on any keychain, but don't forget the security card. Value for money – at €29.90 the Ledger Wallet Nano is rather cheap as far as hardware wallets go. The use of a smartcard in lieu of general purpose microcontroller should boost security and reliability in the long run Validation via security card does not take a lot of effort or time Cons The device must be installed on a perfectly safe computer and not every user will be keen to use the 'air gap' approach. The security card approach has its own pros and cons. While it helps keep the cost down and allows designers to create a truly pocketable device, it also provides slightly lower levels of security than a device with a dedicated screen. However, this issue could to some extent be addressed by the upcoming companion app. Can't be used on mobile devices, support is currently limited to Chrome browser. Alternatives The Trezor wallet features a screen for an added level of immunity, but costs $119. Conclusion There is no such thing as absolute security, but the goal of hardware wallets is to make any potential attack more difficult and resource-intensive. Ledger is no exception – it is designed to render attacks impractical by raising the bar. At €29.90, the Ledger Wallet Nano is good value for money, which means it will appeal to enthusiasts who want to hold bitcoin but don't want to spend too much money on security, and this is what makes it special in my book. It's not an expensive, specialised piece of hardware for the select few, it's geared toward the everyday bitcoin user. The device can fit on a keychain and the security card in practically any physical wallet, which makes the Ledger very practical. If you lose either component, you can still recover your wallet using your mnemonic seed. The upcoming companion mobile app should boost security and bring Ledger on a par with more expensive solutions. Update 31-03-2015 : The Ledger Wallet Nano is now available from Overstock.

coindesk	review-reveal-mobile-social-network	Review: Reveal App Channels SnapChat with a Crypto Edge	2015-07-05T12:00	Name: Reveal What it is: A social networking question-and-answer app for mobile. Who’s behind it: Led by the former founders of Kindr and gossip website JuicyCampus, Reveal has raised $1.5m from Boost VC and Digital Currency Group, among other investors. Cost: Free Date launched: 16th June, 2015. Basic summary: Reveal is a SnapChat-like social network that allows users to ask questions and answer via photo or video. The social network uses reveal coin, an asset on the Stellar network, as its "currency of attention", allowing users a means to incentivize interaction. CoinDesk rating: 4.5/5 The basics Like most social networks, Reveal is a somewhat bizarre and often entertaining journey into mundane life, with users dedicating posts to everything from evidence of their omelette-flipping abilities to their thoughts on age-old questions about wealth and fame. Perhaps most interestingly, the app happens to include a built-in cryptocurrency (reveal coin) that users currently earn based on the number of others they invite to the network (tracked through referrals) and how many likes their content receives. Reveal currently offers 100 RVL for every 'like', 1,000 RVL upon enrolment and 10,000 RVL for every new member a user invites, though these figures will change over time, the company says. In the future, users will also be able to earn off the app's ad revenue and, potentially, for new actions the company wants to incentivize. Reveal intends to keep 75% of its reveal coin as an investment in the future performance of the asset, which will gain in value as advertisers remove RVL from the system through purchases. There will only ever be a total of 52bn RVL, with 13bn allotted to app users. Using the service Reveal's signup process is quick and painless, requiring only a few simple steps. To enroll, a user provides their first and last name and can opt to connect their Twitter account. Next, they are asked to connect an email account and phone number (verified by SMS message), then signup is complete. Click the gallery below to view more images of the app in use: Navigating the app Once inside, users gain the ability to view and navigate posts in three streams, one devoted to friends, the other to trending posts and the final to all posts on the network. True to its name, the video or photos appear with an exterior layer designed to be peeled away so users can 'reveal' the content within. Often, the outside of the posts takes shape with a messy combination of text, emoticons, colors and patterns offered by the app. Posting content Following a bit of an exploration, users who want to make an appearance can click a blue-green arrow in the top-right corner, which will access the app's camera. From there, users click to take a photo or press and hold to take a video (which can easily be erased with a back click). Videos on the service are limited to 15 seconds, with those who film for too long seeing a red bar signal time is winding down. Also available on this screen is the option to choose how long the photo or video stays accessible to potential viewers, with users being able to limit this window to 24 hours. Once the interior content has been created, users are able to draft a cover slide (adding their own messy exterior), then click 'post' to share with others. Asking a question One of the most advertised features of app is the ability for reveal coin to be used to incentivize other users to answer questions. For example, fans of Vine stars like the Miuccio brothers (three muscled beach dwellers with 18,000 YouTube followers and 732,000 Vine followers ) are able to ask questions with reveal coin attached. The more reveal coin attached, the higher the message appears in the user's inbox and the more likely they are, in theory, to post a response. The incentive is also only for a limited time, as after 24 hours, those who post unanswered questions with reveal coin attached are returned the funds. Users can also answer questions sent to them via the questions tab (accessed by clicking the three horizontal lines on the left side of the screen) or start Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions that invite other users to engage with them. Making friends As with other popular social networks, Reveal users are able to follow others with relative ease, clicking their photo beneath the content to access their profile page. In line with its mobile-first design, profiles showcase a picture and a one or two sentence 'about' section alongside metrics for how many followers the user has gained and how many posts they have made. The profile also encourages engagement, with a prominent 'ask' bar displayed on the page. Pros Content columns ease navigation Easy to use and friendly for non-technical demographics Elegant design enables feature-rich environment in mobile setting Format encourages creativity and engagement Impressive following ensures stream of new content Cons Currently no way to withdraw or sell reveal coin Difficult to access reveal coin (requires setting up Stellar account) Some app crashes Lengthy reveal coin materials may turn off young user base Competitors Reveal would be best considered a competitor to more established social networks as well as those seeking to appeal to users with ethereal features. The app also bears some similarity to past attempts at cryptocurrency-based social networks, including projects such as GetGems and ZapChain, though these apps are focused on messaging and tech community discussion, respectively. Conclusion For all those who feel the bitcoin and blockchain industry is too serious, Reveal offers a compelling breath of fresh air. The app positions itself as a precursor to what could be a new wave of projects that prioritize user experience and use cryptocurrency as a way to experiment within established consumer-facing business models. Beautifully designed and as entertaining (or annoying) as its fervent users, Reveal also successfully piggybacks the anti-Facebook wave of social networking, using a new economic model as a way to show how cryptocurrency can create shared ownership within these platforms. Today, however, Reveal arguably goes too far in putting cryptocurrency in the background, meaning enthusiasts won't have much to explore on the app given its limited functionality. Further, it remains unclear how effective the reveal coin model will be at exposing new users to the technology should the ability to trade the coins for real-world value continue to be cumbersome.

coindesk	review-simplicity-is-bitcoin-app-lawnmowers-strength-and-weakness	Review: Simplicity is Bitcoin Investment App Lawnmower's Strength and Weakness	2015-04-17T17:08	Name of product: Lawnmower What it is: Bitcoin's take on the popular investment app Acorns, Lawnmower rounds traditional bank card purchases up to the nearest dollar and invests the change in bitcoin. Made by: Lawnmower.io Who’s behind it: Three University of Florida classmates Pieter Gorsira, Patrick Archambeau and Alex Sunnarborg and strategic backers Boost VC. Cost: Free Date launched: 9th April Basic summary: Lawnmower provides a painless way for users to start saving bitcoin in incremental amounts. CoinDesk rating: 3.5/5 The basics : Available as an iOS app and currently in Android beta, Lawnmower creates a Coinbase wallet for users, connecting the address to a bank account or credit card. Lawnmower monitors the user's traditional purchases, rounding transactions to the nearest dollar, or in the case of a $3.00 transaction, the next dollar, converting this "change" to bitcoin. Using the service To install the service, iOS users download the app to their preferred device. From there, sign-up is broken down into a three-step process. The app is currently limited to users of one of five traditional banking partners, all of whose services can be accessed via financial API platform Plaid. Available banks currently include Bank of America, Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo and US Bank. Once selected, users must correctly answer security passwords used in conjunction with their account. Unlike when accessing online banking, users must correctly answer all questions before moving forward. Lawnmower then displays a screen indicating that it has yet to detect any transaction activity, one that is eventually populated with a history of its purchases. The app requires a minimum of $4 be collected in clippings from purchases before it purchases bitcoin on behalf of the user. Pros - Easy signup process for Coinbase users - Straightforward user interface shows bitcoin accrued, the dollar equivalent and a history of recent purchases at a glance. Cons - Limited currently to USD investors - Requires Coinbase account - Stats page yet to be developed - Users currently limited to one investment option. Security As for security, Lawmower outsources most of the responsibility to its related third-party providers. Banking transaction data is stored outside the app by API provider Plaid, while users can only sell or send bitcoin through their Coinbase accounts. Conclusion Given the overly ambitious aims of many companies in the space, Lawnmower should be lauded for its success at delivering on a simplistic vision. Further, it provides what is most likely the easiest way to purchase bitcoins, requiring only that users to opt in to a program and go about their normal business. As for how it ultimately delivers on its value proposition to investors, however, that depends on the point of view of the user. Alternative apps, like Acorns for example, offer a wide range of investment options, from government bonds to real estate stocks, diversity that isn't yet available in the Lawnmower app. Lawnmower's ultimate usefulness as an investment tool may be dependent on the wider success of cryptocurrency as an asset class, though whether bitcoin will be enough to attract a large target market of investors looking to grow their savings, and by extension, Lawnmower as a company, remains to be seen.

coindesk	ripple-claims-3-money-transfer-firms-xrp-2018	Ripple Claims 3 Big Money Transfer Firms Will Use XRP in 2018 - CoinDesk	2018-01-05T15:55	Three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide will be implementing Ripple’s XRP token in their payment flow systems this year, the company said in a tweet Thursday. The tweet, which did not identify the partners, comes as XRP has rallied to overtake ethereum as the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market cap while Ripple has been criticized for its fairweather and sometimes opaque way of talking about the token. Part of the criticism stems from Ripple having scored more than 100 financial institutions to use its xCurrent product, a messaging platform that does not involve XRP, and many new investors mistaking that for XRP support by those institutions. Before Thursday, only one enterprise – Mexican financial services firm Cuallix – had announced its use of XRP for cross-border money transfers. But the company tweet, and comments to CoinDesk from Asheesh Birla, vice president of product at Ripple, earlier this week, suggest that more will be added this year. In another tweet late Thursday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse responded to a New York Times article casting doubt over XRP’s usage by sharing comments he said were from banks and payment providers who examined or tested the cryptocurrency. Referencing Ripple’s xRapid product, which puts XRP on top of the company's xCurrent messaging platform, Garlinghouse wrote: "Over the last few months, I’ve spoken with actual banks and payment providers. They are indeed planning to use xRapid (our XRP liquidity product) in a serious way." Despite its recent run to nearly $4 per coin, XRP is down on the day, following a statement by Coinbase that it does not have plans, at this time, to list the cryptocurrency (or any other new ones) on either its flagship exchange or its GDAX platform.

coindesk	ripple-vets-raising-money-for-cryptocurrency-hedge-fund	Ripple Vets Raising Money for Crypto Hedge Fund - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T17:30	Two former employees of distributed ledger startup Ripple are raising money for a cryptocurrency hedge fund, public records show. Twin filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated Jan. 25 and 26 show that co-founders Tim Lewkow and Eli Lang are seeking funds to back Fractal Investments, which invests in crypto-assets, per its official website. The company dates back to last summer and has maintained a public profile primarily through its Twitter account. Lang is formerly creative director for Ripple, having begun working for the San Francisco-based startup in 2012. Lewkow worked for Ripple from December 2013 until June of last year, most recently serving as integration engineering manager, according to his LinkedIn account. The filings detail two vehicles, Fractal: Virtual Currency Investment Fund I LP and Fractal: Private Investment Fund LP, both of which are incorporated in Delaware. Neither filings indicate how much money is being raised for either entity. The developments perhaps highlight the continued drive to establish hedge funds and other financial entities amidst a period of heightened activity in cryptocurrency markets and development around the tech more broadly. Like others, Fractal is looking to invest in the growing ecosystem of digitized assets. And even as traditional investors move to invest in the space, others are pushing even further. As reported last week, a group of former Wall Street vets has raised as much as $50 million to create a fund of funds focused on cryptocurrencies. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

coindesk	ripples-xrp-token-hits-time-high-3	Ripple's XRP Token Sets All-Time Price High Above $3 - CoinDesk	2018-01-03T17:45	Just two weeks after it surpassed $1 for the first time, the price of XRP, the token that powers San Francisco startup Ripple's open-source RippleNet network, has set a new all-time high of $3. According to data site CoinMarketCap, XRP has climbed more than 21% in the last 24 hours, hitting a price of $3 just after 17:00 UTC today. Ripple’s rally comes after hitting a temporary low of $2 immediately following its previous all-time-high of $2.85 on Dec. 30, 2017, according to CoinMarketCap. Still, XRP is up 144 percent on the week, and more than 1,000 percent month over month. The cryptocurrency was trading at $0.26 just over 30 days ago. With the change, XRP is also bringing a shake-up to the leaderboard of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. At press time, XRP has heavily increased its lead over ethereum, long the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. While just 24 hours ago Ripple had a $17 billion lead, that figure has now increased to $26 billion. Ripple passed ethereum in market cap less than a week ago, and has been holding the number three spot on Dec. 29, 2017. As Ripple has climbed, so too has the overall cryptocurrency market, with the total market cap surpassing $713 billion just a day after it climbed past $667 billion. On the day's trading, 15 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap are in the green, with ethereum classic, Qtum, EOS, iota and bitcoin offshoot litecoin being the notable exceptions.

coindesk	russian-finance-ministry-proposes-draft-law-on-ico-regulation	Russian Finance Ministry Proposes Draft Law on ICO Regulation - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T15:00	Russia's Finance Ministry has introduced a draft federal law on the regulation of digital assets and initial coin offerings. The new proposal, published by the ministry on Jan. 25, outlines both requirements for projects that launch ICOs, as well as for investors who wish to participate in the token sales. Since it has been introduced by a government body, the draft must yet pass legislative bodies such as the Russian State Duma and Federation Council before becoming law. According to the draft, while there would be no investment limit for investors who are licensed professionals in accordance with Russia's securities law, a 50,000 ruble (around $900) cap would be imposed for investors without qualification for each token issuance. In addition, the proposed law states that ICO organizers in Russia must disclose various information in order to fully comply with the regulation, including the full name of the token issuer, the project's website and network provider, as well as permanent operating bodies of the organizer. However, promotional activities prior to the token sale may be prohibited according to the proposed law, which states: "Prior to the publication of an offer for the release of tokens, the tokens that are issued may not be offered to potential purchasers in any form or by any means using advertising." The new draft marks the latest movement in Russia towards the regulation of token sale activities. According to another explanation of the draft law, it has been based on instruction from Russia's President Putin issued on Oct. 21 last year. The draft also follows up with a lawmaker's comment, made last December, in which he said that the country has been discussing plans to introduce new laws in regulating the field.

coindesk	russias-sberbank-has-launched-a-blockchain-lab	Russia's Sberbank Has Launched a Blockchain Lab - CoinDesk	2018-01-12T10:00	Sberbank, one of the largest banks in Russia, has announced a blockchain laboratory to develop and test blockchain-based solutions. The new lab aims to generate product prototypes, perform pilot tests and deploy blockchain-based business solutions for Sberbank Group, a press release says. According to Igor Bulantsev, Sberbank's senior vice president, blockchain can help in "reshaping" the financial business market, as well as the bank's activities and services. Bulantsev said: "It is important to note that blockchain helps market participants cooperate more efficiently. Hence, Sberbank is making a contribution to the future of the banking industry and our country by launching the blockchain laboratory." The project will work on developing advanced technologies in conjunction with the bank's other laboratories, and is also planning to build collaborations with startups, and via other alliances. Sberbank's blockchain lab will appoint blockchain specialists with experience in building and implementing blockchain ideas to existing products as well as creating new approaches to business activities, the release adds. The launch comes a month after the CEO of Sberbank, Herman Gref, stated that the wider-scale implementation of blockchain in Russia could take as long as a decade. He noted at the time, Russia is "experimenting a lot" on blockchain and added that the bank will introduce some products on a "large scale" this year. In February of last year, Gref predicted that the use of distributed ledger technology by banks and other incumbents could be just 2–2.5 years away. Sberbank has launched number of initiatives in the blockchain ecosystem including its recent entrance into the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance – an enterprise-focused consortium. Some of the bank's blockchain-based pilot projects include joint solutions with Severstal and Federal Antimonopoly Services, among others.

coindesk	saft-symptom-regulatory-uncertainty	The SAFT Is a Symptom of Regulatory Uncertainty - CoinDesk	2017-11-13T14:00	Jerry Brito is the executive director of Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies. In his first monthly column for CoinDesk, Brito argues that the SAFT framework, despite its limitations, is a reasonable path forward for token issuers given the ambiguity of current laws and slim chances of clarifying legislation in the near future. Let’s put to rest a common misconception. During a recent fintech conference at Georgetown Law, Brian Quintenz, a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said that crypto-tokens offered in a pre-sale "can transform." He added, "They may start their life as a security from a capital-raising perspective but then at some point – maybe possibly quickly or even immediately – turn into a commodity." This is how many understand the " simple agreement for future tokens " (or SAFT) concept – that the tokens start as securities and later become commodities. It's wonderful to see that Quintenz is open to novel legal and policy arguments, but that's not exactly how the SAFT model of token distribution is meant to work. The impetus behind the SAFT structure is the fact that there is no bright line rule that determines which types of tokens are securities and which are not. Instead, what qualifies as a security can only be determined by an application of the flexible Howey test to the facts and circumstances of particular tokens. So, in the face of this uncertainty, someone who would like to pre-sell a token that they believe will be a commodity when it is delivered in the future can, in the present, issue a security that promises investors delivery of tokens once a functioning network or application has been developed and tokens can be used on it ( i.e. a SAFT). Once the tokens are delivered, and initial investors seek to sell their tokens on secondary markets to persons who may want to use the network or application, or perhaps to persons who wish to speculate on the future demand for the tokens, then it's appropriate to apply the Howey test to the tokens to determine whether they are securities or not. The bet that issuers and investors of a SAFT are making is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the courts, applying the Howey test at this point, will determine that the tokens are not securities. So there is no "transformation" of a token from a security to a commodity. What we have instead are two separate things: a SAFT instrument that is and will always be a security, and a token that never was and won't ever be a security. This is more than an academic distinction. Transformation is unheard of, while a two-step approach is novel, but not inconceivable. No guarantees There are two things to note about this arrangement. First is that this structuring is not guaranteed to work. I and many others believe that when these tokens are delivered, there will be a good argument to be made that the tokens should not qualify as securities under the Howey test. But it's just that – an argument – and the SEC and courts may not accept it. Second, the argument depends on the facts and circumstances and the economic reality surrounding a particular token. In particular, the argument hinges on the value of the token not depending on the continued efforts of the original issuer, and that market demand for the token is driven by the token's commercial or consumptive use in addition to speculation. Again, there is no bright line test for which tokens are securities, and a token's putative utility alone does not shield it from classification as a security. Mission over minutiae The SAFT approach is very clever, but cleverness is often the hallmark of poor legal reasoning. In this case, however, there's reason to believe that the SEC should want to look kindly on this clever argument. We have to remember that the SEC's mission is not to robotically apply securities law, whatever the outcome. If it were, we wouldn't have such a flexible case-by-case test for securities. Instead, the SEC's mission is "to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation." Its application of the securities laws is in service of that mission. With that in mind, put yourself in the shoes of an SEC commissioner. What state of the world would you want? One in which token presales are always offered to the public – including unsophisticated moms and pops – and hopefully they will buy them for their use rather than as a speculative investment? Or a world where developers, using a security instrument that you understand, limit pre-sales to accredited investors and only once the network or applications is functioning, and the tokens can actually be used, are they made available to the wider public? It seems to me that a policy goal of protecting mom and pop investors and facilitating capital formation argues in favor of allowing a SAFT approach – even if it's a novel and clever structure that pushes the bounds of current law. Long-term aspirations An even better policy might be for the SEC to issue guidance articulating clearly how it plans to apply the Howey test to token sales, or for Congress to write a new law creating a bright line test that excludes tokens with certain criteria from securities regulation. And Congress should certainly consider creating a safe harbor for exchanges that list tokens that seem useful and don't seem to be securities using some specific criteria, like GDAX's new Digital Asset Framework. But given political realities, the probability that the SEC or Congress will do this in the next few years is probably pretty low. While it's certainly worthwhile to advocate for these potentially better approaches, I don't think anyone can expect entrepreneurs to sit on the sidelines waiting for Congress or the SEC to act rather than taking a SAFT route, avoiding U.S. buyers, or avoiding a pre-sale altogether for token distribution. A piece of the action Finally, a SAFT approach has the unfortunate effect of potentially excluding the general public from participation (although perhaps not if a SAFT relies on the SEC's crowdfunding rules). But this is not a problem specific to token sales; it's an issue of how our government has chosen to protect mom and pop investors – by creating incentives that limit many investment opportunities to the wealthy. It might be time to do away with those limitations, but that's a policy issue that's about much more than token sales. And it's great to see Blockchain Caucus co-chair Rep. David Schweikert working to do just that though bipartisan legislation – which recently passed the House – that would expand the universe of persons who can become accredited investors. The lesson in all this? Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

coindesk	san-francisco-blockchain-startups-partner-decentralized-insurance	San Francisco Blockchain Startups Partner on Decentralized Insurance - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T07:02	Two San Francisco blockchain startups are teaming up, including one that is aiming to create a kind of decentralized Airbnb. Short-term housing rental startup Bee Token and financial services platform WeTrust are partnering to develop a "decentralized insurance layer based on crowdsourced security deposits." In other words, the deposits would act as a financial buffer for both the hosts listing on Bee Token's Beenest platform as well as well as guests. To get there, the two startups plan to connect with one another to share information about users, including their overall trustworthiness as either tenants or hosts. The idea is that by bringing down the cost of a major pitfall – that is, insurance against possible property damage – the two companies can open up access to a residential-focused sharing economy. CEO of WeTrust George Li was quoted as saying: "We couldn’t be happier about this partnership with Bee Token. This collaboration is exactly the sort of innovative use case that we believe will demonstrate the advantages of our platform in managing the complex processes involved with decentralized insurance and insurance-like products across diverse industries." Bee Token's platform has its own BEE token, which was just the subject of a $10 million presale. A public token sale begins at the end of this month. In a recent interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Bee Token co-founder Jonathan Chou suggested that the platform would, in a way, cater to those already exposed to the world of cryptocurrencies. "We cater heavily to the cryptocurrency audience to start; it’s not as intuitive to mainstream users", Bee Token Co-founder Jonathan Chou told the newspaper. "We think the new need is for people to be able to spend bitcoin currency."

coindesk	saudi-uae-central-banks-team-test-cryptocurrency	Saudi, UAE Central Banks Team Up to Test Cryptocurrency - CoinDesk	2017-12-13T22:15	The central banks of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are reportedly launching a pilot initiative that will see the two institutions test a new cryptocurrency for cross-border payments. Regional news sources such as The National and Gulf Digital News report that Mubarak Rashid al-Mansouri, the UAE central bank's governor, unveiled the initiative at a meeting of the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). Though a press release tied to the Dec. 13-14 meeting does not directly relate to cryptocurrency, it does reference that financial technology topics more generally will be up for discussion among the group of central bankers and financial regulators. According to GDN, al-Mansouri praised the effort as a first for the region. "This is the first times[sic] the monetary authorities of two countries cooperation to use blockchain technology," he said. As quoted by The National, al-Mansouri described the project as a "digitisation of what we do already between central banks and banks." The involvement of Saudi Arabia's central bank is notable, given that the institution to date has not commented on the tech or indicated that it was looking into potential use cases. By contrast, the UAE is home to a number of private and public sector-driven initiatives, including Dubai's Global Blockchain Council.

coindesk	save-bitcoins-soaring-fees	How to Save on Bitcoin's Soaring Fees - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T05:09	Rising fees seem to be the only thing people talk about in the bitcoin world these days. The crypto space is full of frustration and vitriol on the topic, as the average transaction fee has soared to $19, turning bitcoin's old claim to fame as a cheaper online payment method into a laughable assertion. But despite these increasing costs, and the long-running debate they've caused, developers and users argue there are simple ways to decrease fees that aren't being fully taken advantage of. This point was raised recently when new data came to light suggesting that one bitcoin startup, Coinbase, singlehandedly facilitates as many as half of all bitcoin transactions, based on the drop in overall network volume when the U.S.-based exchange went offline for a couple hours on Jan. 11. The problem with that situation, according to critics, is the company could singlehandedly save users (not only its own but other companies' customers as well) a bundle on their transactions by implementing a couple technical features, namely Segregated Witness (SegWit). And since the code change for SegWit was activated on bitcoin nearly six months ago, many are upset Coinbase hasn't yet implemented it. Sergej Kotliar, the CEO of payment provider Bitrefill, called the new data a "smoking gun" in that it shows how much of bitcoin's limited transaction space Coinbase is using up. The pseudonymous blogger WhalePanda went so far as to blame bitcoin's transaction backlogs and high fees on the Silicon Valley startup's "incompetence." Patience is running especially thin as it relates to Coinbase, since the startup was one of the more vocal during bitcoin's block size debate, complaining about high fees and arguing that an increase in the block size parameter would help alleviate those expenses. Yet, critics argue, the company really shouldn't be complaining since it's not doing everything it can to push fees lower. In response, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter to stress that the company is working on rolling out technical features to reduce fees, but hinted that it's not easy. "Thanks for bearing with us!" he said. (Coinbase declined to comment for this story). But should users not be interested in enduring the fees for transacting, there are several possible ways to reduce them today. The fee halver SegWit was lauded as the optimization that would help bitcoin scale without upping the block size during last year's scaling debates – yet only 12% of bitcoin transactions take advantage of the technology, even though SegWit transactions cost half as much as normal transactions. Not all wallets currently have SegWit capability, but hardware wallets Trezor and Ledger support it and mobile wallets such as Edge (formerly Airbitz) and privacy-minded Samourai Wallet do as well. But for users who don't want to go through the trouble of switching providers, SegWit capability is on its way at other companies too. Coinbase and Blockchain.info are working on implementations, for example, but both have emphasized that SegWit is a new and complex change that they need to take their time with – they could lose user funds if a big enough mistake occurred. Overall though, as the number of companies supporting the new feature grows, bitcoin fees will decrease – some even argue that transaction fees would disappear altogether if SegWit transactions replaced normal transactions. But if fees aren't eliminated altogether, a more specific type of SegWit address is in the works, which could potentially save users more in the future. Estimation game But while users wait for mass SegWit adoption, they can reduce fees individually using fee estimators. Although early bitcoin wallets didn't let users choose fees, this has changed, with many bitcoin wallets providing fee estimator tools to help users decide how much of a fee they should attach to their transaction to get it through the network in a timely manner. In short, the higher the fee, the quicker the transaction will get added to a block, but on the other hand, users don't want to overpay. New fee estimator tools try to help users strike the right balance. That said, some estimators are better than others. Some users check with standalone tools that consider different factors, such as the estimator from University of Freiburg computer science researcher Jochen Hoenicke, which gives a good idea of what fee is required to get your transaction into the next block. Another from Coinb.in considers transaction complexity – such as how much data is sent with the transaction. Fees also take this into account, meaning that even a transaction equal to $1 could have large fees based on a large amount of data attached to the transaction, whereas a transaction equal to $1,000 could have a smaller fee if the amount of data attached to it is limited. Users have criticized some estimators as telling them to pay higher fees than necessary, but that's partly because fees are so difficult to predict. Fees can fluctuate for all sorts of reasons. The day of the week, for instance, can be a factor since people generally make fewer transactions on the weekend, meaning transaction backlogs would ease and fees wouldn't need to be so high during that time. In this way, users who don't need to send money right away always have the option to wait for transaction backlogs to die down. Beyond that, there are more roundabout ways to eliminate transaction fees completely, but these are highly dependent on what wallet or exchange provider is used. For instance, it's possible to transfer bitcoin on Coinbase for free, using its off-chain way of transacting or by moving funds to the startup's cryptocurrency exchange, GDAX. Longer-term tools While the idea of batching a bunch of smaller transactions into one big transaction has been used in the traditional payments space for some time, it's becoming more popular for bitcoin businesses that facilitate payments. If more companies use this feature effectively, bitcoin transaction fees could be reduced by as much as 80 percent, according to one estimate. However, it's worth mentioning that batching can erode privacy and is potentially slower, depending on how the company or user implements it. Despite these tradeoffs, though, several companies, including Coinbase, have announced they intend to implement batching to tame fees. In an effort to keep up with all the industry's progress on decreasing fees, Bitrefill's Kotliar launched a tool that allows users to see how optimized their bitcoin transactions are, displaying whether the transaction used batches, SegWit or a handful of other mechanisms shown to increase or decrease fees. "Just paste a transaction ID and see if you’re overpaying for your bitcoin transactions and withdrawals," Kotliar tweeted. Plus, looking even further into the future, bitcoin developers are working on a handful of projects, such as the Lightning Network, that would be instrumental in reducing transaction fees, even as the number of people using the network continues to grow. Summing up the work in the industry to reduce transaction fees in the short term, BitGo engineer Mark Erhardt tweeted : "There is a lot of throughput to be gained by making better use of the available capacity."

coindesk	sec-cftc-chiefs-eye-closer-scrutiny-of-us-cryptocurrency-industry	SEC, CFTC Chiefs Eye Closer Crypto Scrutiny - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T11:30	Two U.S. financial regulators are increasing their agencies' commitment to bringing closer scrutiny to the country's cryptocurrency industry. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published yesterday, both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ands the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) voiced that they are devoting a significant portion of resources to monitoring the industry. And along with other authorities, they will continue to stamp down on fraudulent activities in the market. The article was co-written by Jay Clayton and J. Christopher Giancarlo – chairs of the SEC and CFTC, respectively – and is the latest public statement from the financial regulators indicating the increasingly strident efforts being made to oversee the industry. In July last year, the SEC issued the notable announcement that the agency may consider tokens issued during initial coin offerings (ICO) as securities that must be registered with the agency. Yet, in the WSJ piece, Clayton and Giancarlo warned those who might try and circumvent the guidance, saying: "The SEC is devoting a significant portion of its resources to the ICO market... Market participants, including lawyers, trading venues and financial services firms, should be aware that we are disturbed by many examples of form being elevated over substance, with form-based arguments depriving investors of mandatory protections." Further, cryptocurrencies are now being "promoted, pursued and traded as investment assets," while their much-touted utility as an efficient medium of exchange now a "distant secondary characteristic," they added. The comments are also in line with recent moves by the SEC in halting ICO activities and filing charges against their organizers. Just last week, the CFTC, which treats cryptocurrencies as commodities, has also notably brought up legal cases to sue allegedly fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. In addition, Clayton and Giancarlo also voiced support in the article for policies that seek to review existing laws to ensure they can efficiently regulate activities pertaining to cryptocurrency. "Many of the internet-based cryptocurrency-trading platforms have registered as payment services and are not subject to direct oversight by the SEC or the CFTC. We would support policy efforts to revisit these frameworks and ensure they are effective and efficient for the digital era," the regulators concluded.

coindesk	securekey-taps-ibm-blockchain-for-digital-identity-system-launch	SecureKey Taps IBM Blockchain for Digital Identity System Launch - CoinDesk	2017-11-15T10:00	Canadian startup SecureKey has revealed it will soon launch a blockchain-based system providing identity verification across the country. Expected to go live in early 2018, the new digital identity platform utilizes IBM's blockchain technology, enabling consumers to prove their identity using cellphones and Windows devices to governments, banks and telecom providers, said Greg Wolfond, CEO of SecureKey. According to Bloomberg, Wolfond said the blockchain ID system enables consumers to control and share their personal information without going through centralized systems that create "honeypots" of valuable information that are vulnerable to hackers. Wolfond added: "This is transformational for identity. It makes it easier for me to prove it's me and harder for the 'bad guy' to masquerade as me." Bloomberg said that Toronto-Dominion Bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, and a number of other major financial firms have invested $30 million Canadian dollars ($23.5 million) in the scheme. The ID system was first announced back in in March 2017, where the company explained that the IBM Blockchain tech is built on top of the open-source Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 platform. The new system "will help tackle the toughest challenges surrounding identity,” said Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM Blockchain, at the time.

coindesk	shipping-blockchain-maersk-spin-off-aims-commercialize-trade-platform	Shipping Blockchain: Maersk Spin-Off Aims to Commercialize Trade Platform - CoinDesk	2018-01-16T12:00	Global shipping giant Maersk wants to wrap the world in a blockchain. With access to a shared, trusted record of transactions, Maersk executives say, the world's shipping companies would save money and be able to better compete on enhanced services. And the company has developed its technology using the Fabric software contributed by IBM to the open-source Linux Foundation, to do just that. Yet one roadblock still remains: finding a way to sell a collaborative system to a bunch of competitors. So Denmark-based Maersk and IBM have decided that by spinning off the project into a standalone entity, they might have more success in attracting Maersk's rivals to the solution. Announced today, the yet-to-be-named joint venture is awaiting final regulatory approval, but the idea is that a well-rounded advisory board (which is still being established) would help ensure transparency and a level playing field among participants. Unlike a typical startup situation, though, the technology behind the venture has already been widely tested, with pilot users including some of the largest companies in the world. DuPont, Dow Chemical and the food packager and processor Tetra Pak have already experimented with an early version of the platform. Plus, custom agencies in the Netherlands and U.S., and ports in Rotterdam and Houston, have all taken part as well. According to the joint venture's CEO, Michael White, the new entity is essential given the variety of potentially competing counterparties involved. "This is not a bespoke Maersk system," White, who was previously the president of Maersk Line in North America, told CoinDesk, adding: "This is going to be an industry-wide, open platform solution for all ecosystem participants." Prime participation Within six months of receiving regulatory approval, White expects the company to make its services available for wider use. Among those interested in using the entity's blockchain solution are General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Agility Logistics, with additional participation from customs and government agencies from Singapore, Peru and China. Also, the global terminal operators of APM Terminals in New Jersey and PSA International in Singapore are slated to use the platform to boost collaboration between their users and improve the way they organize their terminals. According to IBM Global Industry senior vice president Bridget van Kralingen, the venture is part of a bigger effort by the supply chain ecosystem to capitalize on "untapped" resources. "Our joint venture with Maersk means we can now speed adoption of this exciting technology with the millions of organizations who play vital roles in one of the most complex and important networks in the world, the global supply chain," she said in a statement. The spin-off is the latest development by Maersk since it completed its first live blockchain trades in May and revealed a pilot project in Singapore in August. In September, Maersk also outlined plans to deploy a maritime insurance product using blockchain. According to White, the first two services the new company will offer are being designed to provide end-to-end shipping information and to digitize and automate trade paperwork. "Being able to run a global business more efficiently is important," White said, concluding: "The opportunity that the customers see in helping to identify and close key gaps in real-time access to events and to document availability is real. It's palpable."

coindesk	shipping-giant-maersk-to-deploy-blockchain-maritime-insurance-solution	Shipping Giant Maersk to Deploy Blockchain Maritime Insurance Solution - CoinDesk	2017-09-06T12:06	A joint venture between shipping giant Maersk, Microsoft, accounting firm EY and blockchain firm Guardtime aims to apply distributed ledger technology in the field of marine insurance. Built using Azure – Microsoft's cloud-based platform – t he new effort will see the creation of a shared database that logs information about shipments, as well as potential risks, in order to help ships comply with insurance regulations. The database would also ensure that this information is transparent across what is a complex network of variables. Notably, the project has already been trialled, and Maersk plans to use it in real-world applications, along with insurers MS Amlin and XL Catlin, according to Reuters. EY told CNBC that securing marine insurance data with blockchain was necessary due to the "complete inefficiency" of the industry. Mark Russinovish, chief technology officer at Microsoft Azure, explained further: "Marine insurance is a prime example of a complex business process that can be optimized with blockchain." Reuters reported that the platform is already built and is planned for deployment in January. This isn't Maersk's first exploration of blockchain tech. The shipping firm conducted its first blockchain-based cargo-tracking trial in partnership with IBM back in May. IBM has also signed up with a major port operator in Singapore to work with a regional shipping firm to test a new blockchain-based supply chain network.

coindesk	sony-seeks-blockchain-patent-for-user-authentication-system	Sony Seeks Blockchain Patent for User Authentication System - CoinDesk	2017-10-30T08:16	Japanese tech conglomerate Sony may be looking to apply blockchain to a proposed user login system, according to a new patent application. Released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Oct. 26, the document outlines how the electronics maker might use two different blockchain platforms in conjunction with each other as part of a multi-factor authentication system (MFA). MFA systems work by giving users two different credentials to log into a website or program. After a user enters a standard username and password, an authentication token generates a code, which they must also input to gain access. The idea is that while an attacker might be able to gain a user's password, they usually cannot also gain access to the token, which generates a different code for every login. According to Sony's application, one of their proposed blockchain platforms would create these authentication codes, while the other would receive them to confirm a user's identity when they try to commit a transaction through the platform. Possible transactions include data "transfer, contract generation and asset transfer," according to the application. Whether the work outlined in the patent application dovetails with Sony's previously disclosed work with blockchain remains to be seen. Earlier this year, Sony announced an educational platform it is developing in conjunction with IBM, set for a launch sometime next year. The platform will use a blockchain to store student records securely, with the idea being that the technology can provide additional transparency for stakeholders. The company said in a statement that it plans to continue looking into blockchain technology for different fields, including in supply chain and logistics, indicating other areas in which the proposed intellectual property could be applied.

coindesk	south-korea-announces-deadline-for-halt-of-anonymous-crypto-trading	South Korea Reveals Deadline for Anonymous Crypto Trading Halt - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T08:30	South Korea's financial watchdog has set a deadline for the barring of anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts within the country. According to a new announcement from the Financial Services Commission (FSC), starting from Jan. 30, cryptocurrency investors in South Korea will have to use real-name bank accounts in order to continue trading. Once the rule comes into effect, investors can only deposit funds to trade cryptocurrencies if their name on the crypto exchange matches that on their bank account. The move comes as part of the financial regulator's push through a strengthened "know-your-customer" (KYC) compliance to curb cryptocurrency speculation. The FSC said in the release that the new rule is resulted from an inspection of domestic anonymous crypto trading accounts – assisted by six domestic banks, as well as the Financial Intelligence Unit – from Jan. 8–16. In addition, the official announcement also established an anti-money laundering guideline for cryptocurrency exchanges, which outlines situations where exchanges should stay alert to potential illegal activity. The statement said: "Specifically, for users to make virtual currency transactions more than 10 million won per day or more than 20 million won for 7 days when depositing and withdrawing funds, this is the type of financial transaction you suspect for money laundering." The new rule also appears to have a wider affect on foreign nationals who had been using cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea through a virtual bank account. As the FSC's announcement pointed out, minors and non-citizens will be restricted from the new name verification service. So far, three major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea have said they are in line with the new mandate. In an email response to CoinDesk, a representative from Coinone confirmed that it will enforce the change starting from Jan. 30. "Under the new requirement, six banks are preparing the real-name account linkage with exchanges. They are NongHyup, KookMin, Shinhan, KEBHana, IBK, and JB Bank. As for Coinone, our users have to be registered with NongHyup for the time being," the company said. In addition, in its official blog post, Korbit also said on Jan. 19 that the existing fund deposit method will be terminated and replaced this month. It added that users "must have a Shinhan Bank account registered under your legal name." According to a report from South Korean news agency Yonhap, the Bithumb exchange also said it will also enforce the new change as per the government's requirement.

coindesk	south-korea-reportedly-expands-crackdown-bitcoin-exchanges	South Korea Reportedly Expands Crackdown on Crypto Exchanges - CoinDesk	2018-01-11T02:42	New reports suggest that the South Korean government is intensifying its moves against the country's bitcoin exchanges. Reuters reported tonight that Bithumb and Coinone were raided by police and tax office officials on Wednesday and Thursday. Citing employees of the two exchanges, which are among the largest in South Korea, the news service said officials visited their offices amid an investigation into alleged tax evasion. "Local police also have been investigating our company since last year, they think what we do is gambling," a Coinone employee told Reuters. The employee said that the exchange was cooperating with the investigation. In an email to CoinDesk, a representative of Bithumb confirmed that they had met with Korean tax authorities. "It is true that the National Tax Service visited Bithumb. However, we weren't raided by the police," the rep said. Separately, South Korean news service SBS has reported that the South Korean Justice Department is planning legislation that would pave the way for exchanges in the country to be shut down entirely. "The Ministry of Justice will set up its own bill, which sees the virtual money brokerage itself as illegal and completely closes the exchange, and plans to start full-fledged ministry discussions this week," the service reported, according to a translation. According to a subsequent report from Reuters, the Justice Ministry said that a bill was forthcoming. "There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges," Park Sang-ki was quoted as saying. The news represents a significant expansion in the growing scrutiny applied to the crypto-exchange space by South Korean regulators. Earlier this week, the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit and the Financial Supervisory Service announced that they were inspecting six unnamed banks for compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations. The government had already declared in December that it would move to apply more scrutiny amid growing trade volume at the exchanges, including moves to curb anonymous trading. Exchanges in South Korea have consistently seen prices well above those seen on other marketplaces. Indeed, it's a circumstance that earlier this week led to a controversial change by one popular data service to begin excluding some of the country's exchanges from its cryptocurrency price averages.

coindesk	spectre-creators-seek-vc-backing-for-blockchain-free-cryptocurrency	SPECTRE Creators Seek VC Backing for Blockchain-Free Cryptocurrency - CoinDesk	2017-10-25T12:00	A veteran researcher behind two influential papers in the emerging field of crypto-economics is gearing up to launch a new cryptocurrency. Revealed in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Yonatan Sompolinsky, co-author of the GHOST and SPECTRE protocol alongside Dr. Aviv Zohar, intends to release the as-yet unnamed project in late 2018. Based on his body of work, the project aims to solve one of the industry's biggest challenges: the speed at which transactions are disseminated and recorded by distributed ledger systems. Founders of the project include SPECTRE co-author Yoad Lewenberg, and researcher Ethan Hileman, who worked with the team behind bitcoin privacy project TumbleBit. However, the team is not only equipped with developers, but also business experts – including Guy Corem, the former CEO of Israeli-based bitcoin mining firm Spondoolies-Tech, which raised more than $12 million in venture funding before shuttering operations. Together, the team has founded a new startup called DAGlabs, which is said to be raising $15 million as part of a Series A round. Yet, it's the vision for the project that is perhaps most notable, given how it intends to achieve its goal. Rather than using a blockchain system, the public cryptocurrency will be among the first to operate via a system called a direct acyclic graph (DAG) – technology that Sompolinsky framed as a way to finally create a viable payments rail with distributed ledger concepts. Sompolinsky told CoinDesk: "We want to change blockchain into blockDAG. Whether you buy coins or not, you should think about this technology as the next step, releasing the blockchain from the naivety of the chain structure. You will feel this is the natural step towards using a real system." For all the innovation, however, also notable is what the new cryptocurrency will share with bitcoin, today the largest and most valuable blockchain system, but one that is seen as increasingly less relevant for payments. According to the DAGlabs team, the new cryptocurrency will use a proof-of-work mining algorithm in which anyone who purchases hardware can compete for its rewards. That said, Sompolinsky doesn't see bitcoin and other proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies as competitors, so to speak. "I'm not competing with this entire plethora of new blockchains. We have a very boutique and niche and specific one and a well-defined one. We want to scale up layer one," he said. Record of science As told by Sompolinsky, the project is also a critique on the current state of blockchain development, which he views as having been held back by in-fighting. In particular, he cited his experience with arguments about capacity levels on bitcoin, in which developers have often tried to push solutions to scalability in a way that did not change or update the first layer of the system – the blockchain itself. Referring to last year's Satoshi Roundtable summit, an invite-only event in Cancun, Mexico, he recalled an experience where he was shocked by the state of the conversation. "Cancun was an eye-opener for me. In Cancun, everyone was fighting about 1 MB to 2 MB... no one was talking about increasing on-chain scalability by orders of magnitude," he said. Sompolinsky framed the new cryptocurrency as a "vehicle" to enable researchers to take the next step in evaluating this line of exploration, one he argued will benefit from being tested under open market conditions. But given the slate of open-source projects utilizing the initial coin offering (ICO) model as a way to solicit market funding, often for untested concepts, he was also keen to differentiate his project as one based on years of accumulated research. "There are not 800 projects that implement a concept like DAG. Very, very few, maybe less than five that I know of, try to scale up the layer one. There are not 800 projects that say we should abandon the concept of the chain in favor of a graph of blocks," he said. Among those that do are IOTA and byteball, the former being one of the few cryptocurrencies yet to garner a total market capitalization of more than $1 billion. When complete, the final network should appeal to anyone who wants to use a cryptocurrency with "very fast confirmation and low fees," although that's not to say the concept has been perfected. According to Sompolinsky, there are still plenty of items up for debate. For example, he is still open-minded about how he will structure any issuance, stating he is most strongly considering the model used by Zcash Company – the creators of the zcash protocol – wherein accredited investors are given tokens in stages for their support. How it works Still, even those experienced in the field of cryptocurrency may find the concept odd. After all, after the hype around cryptocurrency faded, the so-called "underlying blockchain technology" was often touted as the real secret sauce. That notable researchers would stake a counter-thesis then, is of interest, though it's arguably been a development that has simply received less attention over the years. Explored by Sompolinsky since his earliest work, the idea is that the process of ordering transactions into blocks, then selecting one to add to the chain, could be better optimized. In the SPECTRE concept, blocks are created at the rate of about 10 per second (as opposed to, say, ethereum where one block is created every 21 seconds). All of these blocks are referenced in a DAG, and multiple, interwoven threads of blocks are created. Then, the most valid transaction history is "voted" in by miners selecting the most inter-referential block graph. And because this allows for such a high quantity of transactions to be performed on the network, the transaction history won't be permanently stored. Instead, transaction history will only be stored for a limited amount of time, and once it has been validated, will be removed. Other barriers, including backbone congestions and bandwidth, could lie ahead, though. The team intends to address these potential issues by building incentives into the protocol that encourage participating agents to behave correctly. Still, if the concept on the whole sounds familiar, you've likely come across it when reading about ethereum, which incorporated some of these ideas in how it rewards so-called "uncle blocks" – those that are not selected for inclusion in the ethereum blockchain, but still include useful work. Although uncles aren't considered ultimately valid, they're still profitable to mine, and still get referenced in the blockchain ledger itself. Indeed, what might be most notable about the SPECTRE project is that Sompolinsky's ideas have often proved to be of influence. For example, Casper, ethereum's hotly debated proof-of-stake protocol, derives its name from the GHOST protocol (a play on the "Casper the Friendly Ghost" cartoon series). What's left While the bones of the project are in place, there's still a few questions that need to be fleshed out before the cryptocurrency can be taken to market. Currently under development, the final protocol will be introduced in an upcoming white paper called SPECTRE2. The tech will then begin testing in autumn next year, and by winter, the new cryptocurrency will be launched. Ongoing updates will then continue apace. For one, DAGlabs has been working on combining the SPECTRE cryptocurrency with MimbleWimble, the natively private cryptocurrency that has been the cause of much excitement in the community. Further down the line, the platform also wants to allow DAG-based smart contracts to be written into the platform. But the final step that DAGlabs is pivoting towards is perhaps as ambitious as the cryptocurrency itself. Once the team has established a functioning cryptocurrency, they intend to allow the DAG infrastructure to facilitate something along the lines of "merged mining," which is when the underlying hardware can be used to support a number of cryptocurrencies simultaneously. Still, it's the manner in which Sompolinsky will launch the project that he ultimately wants to call attention to – calling the years of research and engagement with the open-source community, a "respectable" path to market. He concluded: "The easy path for us was to do an ICO; way easier than what we're doing now. We're going for the more respectable path of an equity."

coindesk	starbucks-chairman-hot-blockchain-cold-bitcoin	Starbucks Chairman Is Hot on Blockchain, Cold on Bitcoin - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T21:30	Starbucks Chairman Howard Shultz said the coffee chain plans to incorporate blockchain technology and digital currencies into its long-term payment technology strategy, and hopes to "expand digital customer relationships." Shultz does not, however, believe that bitcoin will play a role in this strategy, remarking that he didn't believe the original cryptocurrency would "be a currency today or in the future." He clarified that Starbucks is not developing a digital currency or announcing an investment in blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but would like to use its stature to lend credibility to these technologies. Shultz made the remarks in the company's quarterly investor call, which were subsequently reported by diginomica. According to the report, he said: "I believe that we are heading into a new age, in which blockchain technology is going to provide a significant level of a digital currency that is going to have a consumer application." Starbucks, he added, is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the changes. "We think we have something to offer the companies that are chasing this, because we are in a position to create the trusted legitimate place in which this could be accepted and possibly take advantage of the mobile payment digital platform that we have created." The platform Shultz referred to is Starbucks' mobile payment app, launched in 2015, which enables customers to pay and order in-app, while accruing rewards. Mobile payments constitute nearly one third of Starbucks' U.S. transactions, and as a result, Shultz said Starbucks is considering implementing cashless stores in the U.S. Starbucks has a history of embracing leading-edge payment solutions. It adopted Square as the exclusive processor of all of its debit and credit card transactions in the autumn of 2012, though the relationship later dissolved.

coindesk	stay-away-from-bitcoin-warns-danish-central-bank-chief	'Stay Away' from Bitcoin, Warns Danish Central Bank Chief - CoinDesk	2017-12-19T10:00	The head of the Danish central bank has warned investors to "stay away" from bitcoin. As reported by state broadcaster DR, Danmarks Nationalbank director Lars Rohde argued that bitcoin is "dangerous" and, likening bitcoin investment to gambling, he said: "If you do not like casinos, you've got a good alternative." Rohde continued: "I see bitcoin like tulip mania, like a bubble out of control." On a concluding note, the director added that the bitcoin market is "completely unregulated" and, thus, no protection is provided by the authorities. "It is the responsibility of the individual" and investors "should not come complaining to us if it goes wrong," he said. Rohde's statements follow soon after an analysis from the central bank (published Dec. 15) stated that introducing a central bank-issued digital currency in the country would not result in better payment solutions and may also bring risks of financial instability. "In a Danish context, it is unclear what central bank digital currency would be able to contribute that is not already covered by the current payment solutions," the analysis states. Back in 2014, Danmarks Nationalbank compared bitcoin to "glass beads" – an apparent reference to the beads that were traded in past centuries for gold, ivory and other commodities. It stated that bitcoin is not money in the true sense of the word, as it is not backed by an issuing institution. Editor's Note: Some of the statements in this report have been translated from Danish.

coindesk	stratumn-deloitte-trial-blockchain-platform-with-14-european-insurers	Stratumn, Deloitte Trial Blockchain Platform with 14 European Insurers - CoinDesk	2017-11-10T10:00	Blockchain startup Stratumn has announced the completion of a blockchain proof-of-concept trial involving 14 insurance companies. The trial was piloted by the French Federation of Insurers and received support from "Big Four" accounting firm Deloitte, according to a press release issued Thursday. As described, the initiative set out to examine blockchain's potential in streamlining insurance industry notification dispatches in accordance with Frances new "Hamon Law" – legislation that enables consumers to switch insurers at any time after the first year, sometimes within 30 days. The system is also designed to handle consumer data as specified by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), due to come into effect next year. Richard Caetano, co-founder and CEO of Stratumn, said the proof-of-concept trial marks a "sector-wide blockchain initiative," adding: "We strongly believe that this technology, coupled with advanced cryptography techniques, can help streamline inter-enterprise processes to benefit all involved parties." The Stratumn effort comes as companies across the insurance industry are starting to experiment with blockchain in the search for new efficiencies. Just this week, Allianz unveiled a blockchain prototype focused on "captive" insurance policies, while in September, shipping giant Maersk, Microsoft and accounting firm EY jointly revealed that they plan to apply blockchain technology in the field of marine insurance.

coindesk	stripe-to-end-support-for-bitcoin-transactions	Payment Processor Stripe to End Support for Bitcoin - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T21:45	Payment processor Stripe announced Tuesday that it will end support for bitcoin as a payment method in April. Product manager Tom Karlo wrote in a blog post that Stripe would transition away from bitcoin over the next three months, fully ending support for the largest cryptocurrency on April 23, 2018. Stripe first enabled bitcoin transactions in 2015, a move that came a year after first testing the technology. At the time, residents from more than 60 different countries could pay merchants on Stripe's network using bitcoin. However, lengthy transaction times, an increasing transaction failure rate, and growing fees mean bitcoin is becoming less popular among Stripe's merchants and users, Karlo wrote. He continued: "Because of this, we've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we’ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense." While Stripe will no longer accept bitcoin payments, Stripe remains "very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall," Karlo wrote, saying he believes support for other coins may be implemented at a future date. The problematic fees were similarly cited by gaming services firm Steam, which announced in early December that it would stop offering support for bitcoin payments. At the time, a representative for the company said that the elevated fees "cause even greater problems when the value of bitcoin itself drops dramatically." In the Stripe post, Karlo left the door open to enabling payments in other cryptocurrencies, namely stellar lumens, the currency of the Stellar network. "We may add support for Stellar (to which we provided seed funding) if substantive use continues to grow," he wrote.

coindesk	stuck-at-12k-bitcoin-price-needs-quick-progress-to-avert-further-losses	Stuck at $12K: Bitcoin Price Needs Quick Progress to Avert Further Losses - CoinDesk	2018-01-19T12:00	Stuck in the doldrums today, bitcoin needs a quick break above $12,500 or the tide may turn in favor of the bears, the charts suggest. The "V" shaped recovery in bitcoin (BTC) from Wednesday's low has stalled below the $12,000 mark in the last 12 hours. Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) did rise to $12,045.09 at 15:14 UTC yesterday, before retreating to sub-$11,500 levels by 22:00 UTC. The slide from the high of $12,045 was extended further to $10,988.79 in Asian hours today. However, bitcoin soon regained poise and rose to an intraday high of $11,808.49 (at 08:44 UTC). As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $11,660. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 3.17 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChainFX. BTC is also up 27 percent from the week's low of $9,199.59 (as per the BPI). However, the price chart analysis says the immediate outlook is neutral and only two consecutive daily closes (as per UTC) above $12,500 would improve odds of BTC rallying sharply in line with the historical pattern. Daily chart The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows: Bearish exhaustion below the 100-day moving average (MA) (as indicated by long-tailed candles), coupled with a close above $11,004 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook. Still, the previous day's doji candle shows indecision in the marketplace following the sharp recovery from the low of $9,005. Further, the 5-day and 10-day MAs carry a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards), while the 100-day MA is flatlined (neutral). Hence, the bulls need progress soon – specifcally a quick move above $12,500 (Dec. 30 low) – or the bears may push BTC below the strong support level of $11,004 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement + 100-day MA). 4-hour chart The higher lows (marked by green arrows) add credence to bearish exhaustion below the 100-day MA discussed above and successful defense of $11,004 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement + 100-day MA) in Asian hours today. Thus, BTC could move above $12,500 (Dec. 30 low) and possibly extend gains to $13,000 (descending trendline hurdle). However, 50-MA, 100-MA, and 200-MA are all sloping downwards in favor of the bears and that could cap gains above $12,500 levels. View An intraday rally to $12,500 cannot be ruled out, but gains above that level are unlikely, courtesy of downward sloping MAs. Only two consecutive closes (as per UTC) above $12,500 would confirm that a bottom is in place at $9,005 and open doors for $17,174 (Jan. 6 high). Bearish scenario: Failure at $12,500 and a close (as per UTC) below $11,004 could yield a deeper sell-off to 200-day MA located at $7,269 today, and seen shifting higher to $7,500 over the next couple of days.

coindesk	survey-reveals-massive-support-for-blockchain-in-healthcare-systems	Survey: Most Medical Group Execs See Promising Role For Blockchain - CoinDesk	2017-10-06T22:00	A new survey of the health care industry has found that executives from hospitals, managed care organizations and other groups are moving to explore blockchain applications in their field. Black Book Research queried 88 health care payers (or institutions that finance medical services) and 276 technology executives, managers and IT specialists from the field, according to the report, which was published on October 3. Among the findings: 90 percent of managers and IT specialists from medical groups felt blockchain could help alleviate problems in the sector, including issues around recordkeeping, network connectivity and information privacy. The study also revealed that 76 percent of payers are either considering blockchain as a tech solution or are in the process of deploying systems that utilize it. Still, the responses indicate that the industry isn't moving all that quickly to embrace the technology. For example, only a small percentage of payers - 14 percent, according to the data – "are involved in trial deployments in some form currently." Further, just 9 percent of providers that responded to the survey indicated that they expect their companies to pursue blockchain integrations by the second quarter of next year. By comparison, 70 percent of payers said their firms anticipate doing so by the first quarter of 2019. The survey also suggests that the possible costs involved remain a barrier. Eighty-eight percent of providers said they would not commit to an integration deadline because of the "undetermined cost of blockchain solutions."

coindesk	swift-signs-agreement-7-csds-explore-blockchain-post-trade	Swift Signs Agreement With 7 CSDs to Explore Blockchain for Post-Trade - CoinDesk	2018-01-16T08:03	Swift has signed a memorandum of agreement with seven central securities depositories to look into how blockchain can be used for post-trade processes, such as proxy voting. Revealed today, the agreement is with U.S.-based Nasdaq Market Technology, Russia-based National Settlement Depository, Switzerland-based SIX Securities Services, South Africa-based Strate, as well as the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, Argentina's Caja de Valores, and Chile's Depósito Central de Valores. Dubbed the CSD Working Group of DLT (distributed ledger technology), the financial infrastructure providers have agreed to explore how DLT could save money and bring new efficiencies to post-trade processes. Proxy voting specifically has been an area of interest for CSDs experimenting with blockchain technology. Swift's head of standards Stephen Lindsay didn't give specific details about the working group's efforts, but instead, told CoinDesk the agreement was more exploratory in nature. "It's a complex area, and there are regional variations in the way that it works, so one thing is to bring the CSDs around the world [together] to actually focus in on the commonalities," he said, adding: "It's not something where we've seen a lot of cooperation in the past, because different markets do things differently. But this is a chance to do something even more different." Informally founded last year, the CSD Working Group on DLT formalized its requirements, adding the use of Swift's ISO 20022 messaging standard in November. "The CSD Working Group on DLT is tackling a key challenge related to emerging technologies, which is a clear lack of standards," said Thomas Zeeb, CEO of SIX Securities Services and Chairman of the International Securities Services Association (ISSA), which recently endorsed the working group effort, in a statement. "As the industry evolves, DLT-specific standards such as [Swift's] ISO 20022, will provide a great foundation, in terms of both existing business content and approach." Echoing that, Lindsay told CoinDesk Swift signing the agreement had to do with making sure DLT technology plays nicely with "existing post-trade processes, some of which are not broken."

coindesk	swiss-government-launches-blockchain-task-force	Swiss Government Supports Launch Blockchain Task Force - CoinDesk	2018-01-09T16:00	The Swiss government is backing new group to cement its regulatory framework surrounding blockchain startups and ICOs. Taskforce Blockchain – spearheaded by Finance Minister Ueli Maurer and Economics and Education Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann – includes both federal and local officials, as well as members of various blockchain startups and legal representatives, according to a fact sheet. The group will look at the legal guidelines surrounding ICOs and blockchain companies, while working with the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters – the federal body responsible for implementing financial market policy and representing the government's financial interests across borders. Schneider-Ammann praised the inclusion of blockchain companies in the conversation surrounding their legal framework. He added: "[Blockchain is] becoming more important as a technology for many industries, not just crypto finance. [What is needed is liberal regulation], which opens opportunities for Switzerland's position while at the same time reducing risks." Switzerland has long been friendly toward blockchain startups and cryptocurrency organizations, and is home to " Crypto Valley," a region in the country known for the number of companies developing projects based on the technology. Additionally, the government's Federal Council proposed a regulatory sandbox last year to create a more welcoming environment for startups to experiment with their projects. Part of this sandbox's mission would be to monitor the development of new business models inspired by financial technologies. The government also aired hopes to encourage more companies to build their base of operations in the European country. The Taskforce Blockchain's first meeting will be on Jan. 12, 2018.

coindesk	templum-raises-2-7-million-in-bid-to-launch-regulated-token-trading-system	Templum Raises $2.7 Million in Bid to Launch Regulated Token Trading System - CoinDesk	2017-10-26T11:00	New York-based blockchain startup Templum has raised $2.7 million in a new seed funding round. The round was led by Raptor Group, Galaxy Investment Partners, Blockchain Capital and firstminute.capital, the startup said in a statement. Raptor Group, founded by billionaire businessman Jim Pallotta, has invested in major firms such as Uber, as well as blockchain industry startups like Paxos, among others. As previously reported by CoinDesk, Templum (along with its affiliate broker-dealer Liquid M Capital) is seeking to launch a platform for the trading of blockchain-based tokens that are considered securities. Utilizing a so-called alternative trading system (ATS) that is subject to regulation from agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the startup is hoping to develop both primary and secondary markets around such tokens. "ICOs offer innovative organizations an efficient alternative for raising capital. However, ICOs in their current form can be highly risky for issuers and investors. Templum will provide the necessary transparency, accountability and investor protection to reduce risks and encourage more widespread acceptance of ICOs," Chris Pallotta, Templum's founder and chief executive officer, said in a statement. Templum, along with firms like Overstock's tØ, are pushing to tap into the interest surrounding the blockchain funding model, through which the sale of cryptographic tokens can be used to bootstrap new projects. Effectively, the firms hope regulated trading systems will attract more seasoned stakeholders to a market that has, to date, seen more than $2 billion raised, according to CoinDesk data. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Paxos.

coindesk	tencent-taps-intels-hardware-for-iot-blockchain-solution	Tencent Taps Intel's Hardware for IoT Blockchain Solution - CoinDesk	2017-09-13T12:04	Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent announced a blockchain research partnership with multinational tech corporation Intel at a conference yesterday. The deal, which will see a new R&D lab established in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, aims to fuse Intel Core technology with the Tencent User Security Infrastructure (TUSI) standard to develop a secure blockchain system for the Internet of Things (IoT). The effort aims to develop accounts secured by "hardware keys and blockchain," so that IoT devices can "enjoy unified security capabilities," a local news source states. Intel has been pursuing blockchain technology for some time, with a particular emphasis on its own hardware-based security. As reported by CoinDesk, the firm uses so-called "software guard extensions" (SGXs) to create secure enclaves within its processors to protect vital data. Tencent, which notably developed the WeChat messaging app, also has a history with blockchain technology. Back in April, the company released a white paper detailing a suite of blockchain services currently in development. And, in June, the firm revealed work with Bank of China on a blockchain research effort.

coindesk	tennessee-legislators-say-state-ready-blockchain	Lawmaker Says 'Tennessee Is Ready for Blockchain' at Bill Hearing - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T20:15	A bill to recognize blockchain signatures as legal electronics records could move swiftly through Tennessee's legislature, lawmakers suggested during a hearing on Wednesday. According to the Nashville Post, local stakeholders met with members of the Tennessee General Assembly to discuss the measure, which was submitted earlier this month state lawmaker Jason Powell, as previously reported by CoinDesk. The bill stipulates that "a signature that is secured through blockchain technology is considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature," and also contains language on the use of smart contracts as well. The proposed law is in the vein of other pieces of legislation filed in Florida and Nebraska in recent days. As quoted by the post, lawmakers in the General Assembly have struck a positive tone about the bill and its prospects for passage. "Tennessee is ready for blockchain," said Rep. Pat Marsh, who added that he expected it to move through the legislature. "We are open for business." Among the startups to attend the hearing was Change Healthcare, represented by Emily Vaughn, the firm's product development director. She argued that the state could benefit from enshrining the tech's characteristics into state law. "When you guys are considering ways in which Tennessee could benefit from this technology, there are opportunities to bring new businesses here and opportunities to grow our existing businesses," she argued.

coindesk	texas-halts-crypto-banking-operation-over-regulatory-violations	Texas Halts Crypto Banking Operation over Regulatory Violations - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T10:02	Texas financial authorities are increasing their regulatory scrutiny over activities related to cryptocurrency. According to a press release issued Jan. 26, the Texas Department of Banking said its cease-and-desist order issued to cryptocurrency banking platform AriseBank has taken effect, barring its services in the state. The department's banking commissioner Charles G. Cooper, said the firm has been promoting and offering banking services while not chartered or authorized to engage in banking in the state, and is "not supervised by or registered with any Texas or federal regulatory agency." The order said the company has violated the Texas Finance Code Chapter 31 and thus AriseBank is required to "cease and desist from implying that they engage in the business of banking in Texas" and to clarify that it will not offer services to Texas residents. According to the original order that, issued on Jan. 5, AriseBank had 21 days to appeal. Yet, since no submission was received, the department said the order is final and non-appealable. During an interview with the podcast Coast to Coast AM on Jan. 27, AriseBank's co-founder and CEO Jared Rice, Sr. said the Securities Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a raid on the company's office on Friday Jan. 26. According to Rice, AriseBank's asset and funds raised from initial coin offerings were seized by the law enforcement. While the website of AriseBank is currently unavailable, a previous press release and historic data captured by Archive.org shows that the firm touts a "decentralized banking platform" that includes storage, exchange and payment services, as well as Visa cards linked to crypto accounts. The website also promoted Evander Holyfield, the former professional U.S boxer, as its "official AriseBank endorser." As of press time, Holyfield could not be reached for comments. In its press release – dated Jan. 25, just one day before the appeal deadline – AriseBank said that, since the company adopts a decentralized model and does not hold user's funds at custody, "it is wholly unnecessary for the platform to be FDIC regulated or insured." The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is the U.S. federal agency that insures deposits and oversees financial institutions for consumer protection. And yet, according to the same announcement, AriseBank was in the process of acquiring two FDIC-insured banks – KFMC Bank Holding Company and TPMG. Although AriseBank claims the two entities are well established with decades of history, little information about either KFMC or TPMG could be found online. In addition, the while the new order did not specifically target AriseBank's recent ICO activity, it appears that the company's token sale is still affected, as the ICO website is also not currently available. According to another release from Jan. 18, the platform said it raised $600 million within weeks around the end of 2017, and netted $500 million in the public token sale. Email inquiries sent to AriseBank and Rice, Sr. were not responded to, as of press time. The action by the Department of Banking is the latest effort by Texas authorities to scrutinize services or products that pertain to cryptocurrency. Previously, the state has also issued a cease-and-desist order to a scheduled initial coin offering (ICO) by BitConnect, which was followed by the platform's notable shut down.

coindesk	tokenized-tor-orchid-blockchain-decentralized-internet	Tokenized Tor? A16z, DFJ and More Back Private Internet Project Orchid - CoinDesk	2017-10-26T13:00	Some of the most notable names in venture capital are backing the idea cryptocurrencies could one day power a truly private internet. Announced today, Andreessen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital, Compound VC, Crunchfund and Danhua, along with Draper Fisher Jurvetson, MetaStable, Polychain Capital, Sequoia and Struck Capital are revealing a $4.7 million investment in a new startup called Orchid Labs Inc. Equally impressive, apart from the investors, is the team behind the project, which boasts an array of both blockchain technology veterans and established entrepreneurs. Co-founders include Steve Waterhouse, a long-time investor with blockchain-focused venture firm Pantera Capital, former Ethereum Foundation developer Gustav Simonsson, Stephen Bell, the founder of Trilogy VC China, software engineer Jay Freeman and longtime Free Software staffer Brian Fox. However, it's the vision that perhaps most distinguishes the Orchid project, with Waterhouse going so far as to frame it as both a rejection of what he called Silicon Valley's "sharing is caring" culture, and a way to restore internet freedoms that he views as being subverted by such business models. Waterhouse told CoinDesk: "This is about anti-surveillance and anti-censorship, the ability to not be tracked. We see this not just in China or the Middle East, but in this country, in states that are considered to be free. If you go back in history, there was a lot more concern about privacy on the internet before Facebook." For Waterhouse, though, the idea began with a rather personal wake-up call. Following his departure from Pantera, he said he was seeking ideas in AI and enterprise software, exploring various ideas and inspirations; then, he was hacked and his information exposed. "That really woke me up," Waterhouse said. "I was more concerned about surveillance, the idea that we don't have technologies to let people communicate without censorship." Investors such as Ryan Zurer, venture partner at Polychain Capital, struck a similar tone, suggesting an expansive use case that is global in scope. "Users could be someone in Catalonia who can't access their government websites or someone in the US who wants to make secure transactions without oversight," he said. Still, Waterhouse sees Orchid's token working within these margins, going so far as to suggest large internet applications such as Facebook could eventually become users of the tech to anonymize their own traffic. A new VPN While a white paper for the project isn't yet available, those close to the project described the code as a more mature offering in what has been a market defined by quick launches. Still, the offering is not without similarities to the average ICO. For one, the orchid token (OCT) will be issued on the ethereum blockchain, and like projects such as Blockstack, it will be seeking to change internet behaviors. However, unlike other decentralized internet attempts, Waterhouse said Orchid would offer software for the exit and routing nodes that form the network itself, marking a differentiator, in that the underlying infrastructure wouldn't be altered. In practice, users wouls use the internet as they do today, but would exchange tokens with these nodes as a means of protecting their information from internet service providers (ISPs) and carriers, or providing it to an intermediary like a virtual private network (VPN). The idea is users would purchase tokens from an exchange or earn them by dedicating available bandwidth toward running a node on the network, at which point they would be sent to a wallet application. When users wanted to hide or shield their activity, they could then spend tokens as part of their activities. "You're paying to access the relay nodes and [to] encrypt and anonymize the traffic, and all the way along the chain, the nodes are being paid," he continued. This doesn't mean that ISPs and carriers wouldn't see the traffic, according to Waterhouse, but that it would utilize techniques to make orchid protocol traffic indistinguishable from typical internet traffic. Here, he said the startup will draw on advisors including Gavin Wood, founder and CTO at Parity Technologies, Stanford's Dan Boneh, and Alex Lloyd, managing director of Accelerator Ventures. Ultimately, though, he predicts the technology will be strong enough to prevent governments from compromising the network, hinting at fears that states have infiltrated the Tor network. "China would be forced to shut down outside internet, or allow our system to work," he said. "They're not going to be able to tell the difference." Free riders But ultimately, Waterhouse said, the orchid protocol will derive value from being flexible within the boundaries of the current internet. For example, as opposed to restructuring it, as proposed by other decentralized technology enthusiasts, he described the protocol as a layer that would "sit on top of the internet." This wouldn't stop users from accepting cookies or engaging in voluntary behaviors that might indicate their information. Looking ahead, however, it will be some time before users get to test out the software, now in alpha. As Orchid raised the funds via a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens), a legal tool created as a means of funding the future creation of tokens, the team is just now gearing up for a potential market sale. But, a beta launch is not expected until early 2018. More set in stone are Orchid's long-term revenue plans, which according to Waterhouse, won't include seeking to extract payment from the protocol. Ultimately, Waterhouse believes that Orchid will be best incentivized by ensuring the protocol's long-term utility by holding a stake in its token supply, which would in turn also ease the end-user experience. He concluded: "That's the model for the investors and the company, we hold tokens." Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstack.

coindesk	tokens-will-bring-conflicts-of-interest-to-healthcare	Tokens Will Bring Conflicts of Interest to Healthcare - CoinDesk	2018-01-17T09:00	Roger Boodoo, MD, is a radiologist and clinical informatics fellow actively seeking opportunities where blockchain technology might be applied to challenges in healthcare. The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review. Let's start with the problematic scenario. A medical researcher stands behind the podium at a prestigious healthcare conference and proclaims that the "Kill Cancer Blockchain" will revolutionize the clinical trials process. The audience erupts with enthusiasm and begins to believe in this new "blockchain" concept. Most of the healthcare conference attendees are unfamiliar with the nuances of blockchain. Little do they know, the researcher holds 100,000 "Kill Cancer" tokens and other cryptos in a cold storage wallet. Disruption, come hither Sure, that future may be exaggerated, but it's one that might be worth considering. In the fall of 2016, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), a division within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, challenged industry, academia and developers to a blockchain contest. The ONC solicited white papers on subjects including patient-reported outcomes, interoperability, healthcare finance and clinical research. Over 70 white papers entered the competition and the contest helped to springboard healthcare into the world of blockchain. Furthermore, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) 2017 annual conference, attended by over 40,000, held a full day Blockchain in Healthcare workshop which sold out. In 2016, Distributed Health, a healthcare-specific blockchain conference, spawned as well as others, and they grew and gained momentum in 2017. And this is likely to continue as entrepreneurial concepts are finding fertile ground at the intersection of healthcare and blockchain. However, changing the course of a slowly moving, highly regulated, behemoth takes time. Medical claims and billing with a built-in fraud prevention blockchain, supply chain management to help prevent phony medications, medical devices with IoT integration, the verification of provider credentials across state lines, private and secure health information exchange with an immutable audit trail, all could cut overall medical cost and improve efficiency. These are just a few use-cases that blockchain will transform. And many have not been thought of yet, but they are coming… Unsurprisingly, a plethora of startups are grasping at the opportunity. For example, Health Nexus from SimplyVital Health is a healthcare-grade blockchain with protocol-level governance and validated HIPAA-compliant miners. The protocol is a fork from ethereum and the smart contracts and apps require Health Cash, the Health Nexus token, to run. Other healthcare companies or researchers can build apps on Health Nexus blockchain for free. Moreover, many other startups are building on ethereum and initiating their own ICOs. The tokens or coins are then listed on exchanges and made available for traders, investors and speculators. Conflicts of interest Indeed, a tsunami of blockchain-related literature and presentations touting the revolution of healthcare is coming and the ensuing conflicts of interest statements will inherently become opaque and cryptic. Digital cryptocurrencies have seen an astronomic increase in monetary valuation. As this valuation may be rooted in the successes of the blockchain, should presenters of blockchain-based research and applications disclose cryptocurrency holdings and their amounts? The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ Uniform Disclosure Form for Potential Conflicts of Interest is the de-facto standard, and it is used by many academic journals to include the likes of the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Radiology and the British Medical Journal. The purpose of this form is to provide conference attendees and readers of manuscripts with information about the author's other interests that could influence how they receive and understand the work. This form does not address cryptocurrencies specifically but does state that all monies received that can be relevant should be disclosed. It continues to state that it is best to disclose than not to, if there is any question about a conflict of interest. Cryptocurrencies fall into the "other" category. The goal is to provide transparency to allow the objective consumption of the presented material. Yet, as blockchain efforts expand, we face the question of cryptocurrency holdings as a potential conflict of interest to investigators looking to further its role in healthcare. This problem is multifaceted, based not only on the financial ties between cryptocurrency and the successes and failures of blockchain, its platforms and applications, but the inherent anonymity of the investment. Like most ethical concepts, this consideration came about through retrospective analysis of past projects and the implications on future blockchain-based research, presentations and publications. The challenge is the analysis and difference of opinion on the question of whether the new champions of blockchain in healthcare should disclose the holding of cryptocurrencies in their personal digital wallets or in any form of fund, and should they disclose the amount? Technologies such as immunotherapy, artificial intelligence and CRISPR will also likely change healthcare, but they will follow the convention rules regarding conflicts of interest, meaning authors and presenters will disclose associations with commercial entities or financial support before peer-reviewed publications or professional speaking engagements. Most traditional financial assets and associations are easily traceable through tax records and statements, which result in a feeling of greater responsibility to disclose. However, the inherent secrecy and anonymity of cryptocurrency raise questions about traceability and disclosure in general. Conclusion and solution It's a worthy question, and one I'm thinking about as I weight the benefits of the technology. I am actively brainstorming healthcare related use cases, beginning to build proofs-of-concept and submitting abstracts to medical societies. I am promoting the use of blockchain, yet it is not clear if I must disclose these potential conflicts. I believe cryptocurrency holdings should be considered for disclosure when presenting research and potential applications of blockchain technologies in healthcare in any form. These disclosures are not meant to question a person's integrity or hinder progress, but instead to allow for the consumption of information in an unbiased manner. A conflict of interest later discovered can lead to a retracted journal article or a discredited presenter. Regardless, if professional societies require presenters to disclose coins of interest or not, I encourage transparency. Radical transparency can only help to further the adoption of blockchain applications in the healthcare settings, and healthcare hungers for disruption. If the "Kill Cancer" tokens are coming, then there may be many buyers, and with a cause like that, who wouldn't want to be among them?

coindesk	trump-signs-defense-bill-authorizing-blockchain-study	Trump Signs Defense Bill Authorizing Blockchain Study - CoinDesk	2017-12-12T18:40	U.S. President Donald Trump has signed a $700 billion military spending bill that includes a mandate for a blockchain cybersecurity research study. As CoinDesk reported in September, the bill – as advanced by the U.S. Senate at the time – called for the Department of Defense to investigate "potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies." The language itself is part of the wider Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT), which focuses on improving the government's IT and cybersecurity systems. The blockchain study, according to the latest version of the text (which was ultimately signed earlier today by Trump), will constitute "an assessment of efforts by foreign powers, extremist organizations, and criminal networks to utilize such technologies;...[and] an assessment of the use or planned use of such technologies by the Federal Government and critical infrastructure networks." The results of the study, according to the text, are due to be delivered to Congress sometime in the next 6 months. While it is set to be prepared by the Department of Defense – which has explored a number of applications in the past – the final product is likely to include input from other federal agencies and departments. And though it constitutes a minor element in major funding law, the measure, proposed by Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, could help spur investigation into possible blockchain uses within the U.S. government, some observers say. "Blockchain was clearly one of the technological capabilities that Congress meant for agencies to look at, and what they were trying to do was create dollars with some flexibility to them so that agencies would have their own discretion on what they invest in," Trey Hodgkins, senior vice president of public sector at the Information Technology Industry Council in Washington, D.C., told CoinDesk last month.

coindesk	trust-odometer-blockchain-test-aims-turn-tide-car-tampering	Trust Your Odometer? Blockchain Test Aims to Turn Tide on Car Tampering - CoinDesk	2017-07-21T12:30	When BigchainDB CEO Bruce Pon was working as a project manager for automaker Daimler in the mid-2000s, he envisioned a simple solution for generating and verifying the story of a vehicle. How was it driven? How many miles were on the clock? And so on. Gathering and presenting this data was possible, but maintaining its veracity simply wasn't possible at the time. "It was an idea I had thought of in 2008. Why couldn’t you create a 'digital twin' of a vehicle, of all the parts, and the actions that have occurred on that vehicle?” he said. This "twin" would serve as an immutable version of the car, detailing how many miles it had driven, or if its maintenance was up to scratch. Pon told CoinDesk: "We looked at doing this in 2008 and the technology wasn’t there because we didn't have blockchain, we didn't have this universal basis for people to confidently share information." Fast forward nearly 10 years and Pon's startup, BigchainDB, is immersed in an ongoing project with German energy company Innogy revolving around just this concept. The project’s ambitious aim is to create a digital identity on the blockchain of any physical good that will verify its provenance. The clocking problem The secondhand car market is rife with question marks and even outright fraud. Sellers and dealerships could tamper with a car's odometer to reduce the number of miles on the clock, making the vehicle appear in better shape than it actually is. Odometer fraud, or "clocking," is by no means new, but it's an issue that continues to plague the industry. A Ferrari dealership in Florida, for example, became wrapped up earlier this year in a lawsuit that claims it was clocking odometers on its luxury cars. To tackle this, Pon's CarPass project creates a record of the odometer and vehicle activity with the data visible and verifiable on the digital twin platform. "If someone starts tampering with the mileage, you basically see it as a step change in the data that someone tampered with [it]," said Carsten Stöcker, who heads up Innogy’s blockchain efforts. True story But clocking is just one component. CarPass wants to record and show the entire story of a car. The system captures information from a car's telematics box, and logs the data on the ledger. The telematics box, or "black box," measures how the car has been driven and operated. However, on its own, the black box is not enough. "One of the big problems was that nobody trusted one specific entity to own that automotive data," said Pon, adding: "With digital twin, what it means is, in a blockchain environment, you can have different parties giving you different information, so a TomTom device could give navigation, geolocation; [Internet of Things] could give you whether or not the shocks in the brakes were used harder than normal. The car manufacturer or components supplier could give additional data about components for predictive maintenance." This creates a "true story" of the car, he said. Wider benefits But there are other advantages as well. This data can be used for predictive analytics to help estimate a more accurate resale value, or if the car has been abused as a result of the driver's handling of the vehicle. This immutable data and verification has benefits for insurance providers, dealerships and drivers themselves, since they can trust the data provided. The scalability of blockchain is a potential inhibitor of the system, though, especially when it comes to fees like those seen on the bitcoin blockchain. CarPass and the digital twin was first built using ethereum as the prototype, but the team eventually shifted to a newcomer platform called IOTA for the proof-of-concept. Unlike other blockchains, IOTA's peer-to-peer Tangle network allows IoT devices to share data with no fees, said David Sonstebo, founder of IOTA, adding: "You want to ensure that that data is completely tamper-proof and that is what any distributed ledger can bring. But IOTA can bring it in a unique way in the sense that it doesn’t get inhibited by fees and scaling limitations like regular blockchain." In the proof-of-concept, IOTA manages the many transactions taking place at speed and keeps the costs down, while Bigchain captures and stores all the metadata from these transactions. Into the real world So far, Innogy has already rolled CarPass out across one of its car fleets in a trial aimed to demonstrate the service in action. And there are plans to expand the number of trials too. "We are in touch with a couple of automotive OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and they’re preparing proofs-of-concept to experience the technology," he said. Yet, CarPass is just one proof-of-concept for the digital twin idea, and much wider uptake will be needed across different verticals to realize its full potential. Innogy and BigchainDB are also working with Austrian blockchain startup Riddle&Code to develop a test for authenticating clothing with a blockchain, embedding NFC chips in the material. The next step is building an ecosystem around the digital twin platform, Stöcker added: "We are in now in discussion with other industrial players to form a consortium."

coindesk	u-s-senators-decry-venezuelan-petro	US Senators Blast Venezuela's Oil-Backed Cryptocurrency Plan - CoinDesk	2018-01-22T22:55	U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R.-Fl) and Robert Menendez (D.-NJ) have denounced Venezuela's planned cryptocurrency in a new letter. In an open letter addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Rubio and Menendez asked how the Treasury Department was monitoring Venezuela's plan to create its own oil-backed cryptocurrency, which the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, has said will help the country avoid global financial sanctions. The two senators want to know how the department will move to prevent the country from using the "petro" to bypass American sanctions. The letter noted that Venezuela has spent several years in an economic crisis, resulting in a lack of access to basic resources for most citizens. Rubio and Menendez wrote: "We have serious doubts about whether Venezuela has the capacity to launch a cryptocurrency, but regardless, it is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular." The project has sparked its share of controversy even within its home country, with the nation's Congress denouncing it as illegal and saying the legislature needs to vote on the token's creation. Earlier this month, an alleged white paper for the coin was shared on social media, but the central government labeled it as false, saying that Maduro would announce the token's white paper at a later date.

coindesk	u-s-think-tank-finds-rising-bitcoin-price-linked-terrorist-interest	Think Tank Links Rising Bitcoin Price to Terrorist Use - CoinDesk	2017-12-21T05:01	Groups affiliated with Islamic extremism are showing an increased willingness to raise funds with bitcoin, according to a U.S. national security advisor. After more than a year without identifying a single instance of a group associated with terrorism publicly using bitcoin to solicit donations, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, which advises both public and private entities on matters relating to national security, has identified four cases in less than a month. The jump in instances of terrorist organizations fundraising with bitcoin began early last month, just as the price of bitcoin first passed the $10,000 milestone, according to new findings. But while the actual amount being raised by the outfits are still relatively tiny, the think tank's director of illicit finance analysis, sees the spike as part of a bigger-picture exploration of cryptocurrencies by terrorist organizations. "My theory is the attention to bitcoin has probably led to certain groups taking a look at the technology," said director Yaya Fanusie in interview. As part of Fanusie's work to educate the public on his findings, the former Central Intelligence Agency analyst has today released a report detailing the work. Published on business security website Cipher Brief, the report details an unintended and perhaps sobering consequence of bitcoin's skyrocketing price. Fanusie told CoinDesk: "If you care about cryptocurrency gaining adoption, you can't close your eyes to illicit actors trying to use it. If they're going to use it we need to look at this as a society and a government to understand what it means." In plain sight Most interestingly, though, may be that rather than any cloak-and-dagger investigative techniques, Fanusie instead gathered his intelligence from online websites. Specifically, the information was pulled directly from propaganda sites for both the extremist group Al Queda and its rival, the Islamic State (IS), as well as a jihadist website monitoring group and an Israeli research institute that keeps tabs on this type of web activity. In the research, patterns also emerged. For example, after the bitcoin addresses associated with the fundraising campaigns were posted to public-facing websites, they were then promoted using Facebook and Telegram. According to the report, both of the social media sites eventually blocked the related users, but that didn't keep new accounts from quickly popping up. While most of the bitcoin addresses failed to receive any funds, the most successful received a bitcoin donation worth about $685, used to build a camp in Syria and provide reinforcement. Shortly after the 0.0757 bitcoin was donated to the still-active campaign, the cryptocurrency (worth about $1,389) was moved to a separate account. Other fundraising activities included more mundane efforts such as website hosting. As of Dec, 19, Fanusie has confirmed to CoinDesk the funds had still not been spent. "In general," Fanusie told CoinDesk, "it appears these campaigns have not been very successful, for the most part, of course every cent matters." The United Nations last year estimated that the number of casualties in the Syrian civil war alone — not counting other engagements involving ISIS and Al Qaeda — is now upwards of 400,000 people. A cause for concern And while the total amount raised is minimal, a notable aspect of the report is what appears to be the increasing sophistication of the campaigns seeking bitcoin funds. In one case, first reported by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center based in Israel, a website identified by Fanusie as being "pro-IS" appears to have initiated its fundraising campaign using bitcoin processing site CoinGate. While CoinGate told CoinDesk the user was "blocked...prior to publication of this case," Fanusie said the website that originally posted it, Akhbar al-Muslimeen, has since generated as many as a dozen bitcoin addresses without the need of a bitcoin processor. From the report: "This shows some technical sophistication on the part of that site’s administrators, because they apparently have eliminated their dependence on digital currency exchange services. Also, because the site’s donation page generates a variety of bitcoin addresses where funds can be sent, instead of just one, it may be harder for outsiders to monitor donations." In spite of this technical proficiency though, Fanusie hedged the overall sophistication of the operations. The pseudonymous nature of bitcoin means the technology doesn't provide as much protection as the Islamist extremist organizations seem to believe. Still, going forward, Fanusie is concerned that could change. His report concludes with a warning that while cryptocurrency could help provide financial services to those unable to get a bank account, more advanced identity protection could even-further embolden terrorist fundraising efforts. "If anonymization gets more prevalent within cryptocurrencies, are we going to have a problem like we had with the iPhone encryption issue we had a couple of years ago?" Fanusie asked, concluding: "That's the issue down the road that I'm most concerned about."

coindesk	ubin-part-2-singapore-central-bank-publishes-blockchain-project-details	Ubin Part 2: Singapore Central Bank Publishes Blockchain Project Details - CoinDesk	2017-11-14T08:30	The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state's de facto central bank, has released a new report focused on the second phase of its "Project Ubin" blockchain initiative. The report constitutes a sequel of sorts to an earlier test which involved the MAS and a consortium of major banks, along with distributed ledger startup R3 and professional services firm Deloitte. And while that phase focused on the digitization of the Singapore dollar as data on a blockchain, the second round tackled an area subject to tests by other central banks world wide: the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system. Indeed, it represents a kind of natural progression, given that RTGS systems – run by institutions like the MAS – handle large amounts of currency moving from bank to bank. The second phase of Project Ubin, representatives said earlier this year, was aimed at researching how a system underpinned in part by the tech would compare with existing systems. The test focused on three platforms – Hyperledger Fabric, R3's Corda and JPMorgan's ethereum-based Quorum – and also involved the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and professional services firm Accenture. As detailed in the report, the project determined that the platforms tested could serve as bases for distributed ledger-based RTGS systems. Notably, the authors state that should such a system come into operation,"the conventional role of a central bank or payment system operator as the centralised infrastructure operator in the ecosystem will be obsolete." The report states: "This would also mean that a central financial market infrastructure operator would not be necessary, as the processes and data are distributed across the participants in the DLT network. A DLT-based RTGS system reduces the costs and resources for the day-to-day operations and eliminates the risk of the central bank being the single-point-of-failure of the entire financial ecosystem." Yet as argued, a central bank in that kind of environment would still serve several roles, such as making sure that node operators are running the latest software and resolving any disputes that emerge between parties. Phase three? As indicated in the report, Project Ubin is likely to continue in future phases. One use case up for further testing, according to the MAS, would focus on bond payments. While the exact details aren't clear, the central bank suggested that Singapore's stock exchange may become involved in such an initiative. "Future phases of Project Ubin could focus on a decentralized bonds payments system, which could be supported by MAS and the participant banks with execution driven by Singapore Exchange. This could deliver a more efficient fixed income securities trading and settlement cycle through DLT," the report stated. Additionally, the report suggested that some of the technology approaches researched in the first two phases of Project Ubin could be further developed to achieve other purposes, including cross-border payments.

coindesk	uk-central-bank-mulls-cryptocurrency-linked-to-pounds-sterling	UK Central Bank Mulls Cryptocurrency Linked To Pounds Sterling - CoinDesk	2018-01-02T10:00	A research unit established by the Bank of England (BoE) is investigating the introduction of a cryptocurrency linked to pounds sterling. The team involved expected to report back within the next 12 months, a Telegraph report says. If approved, the central bank-issued cryptocurrency would allow British users to keep their digital money with the central bank itself, eliminating the need for retail banks. The system would also enable large transactions to be carried out almost instantaneously, the report says. Talking to the Treasury Select Committee in England in December, BoE governor D r Mark Carney said that he has participated in discussions with major central banks on launching digital currency, adding that BoE had carried out a successful test on blockchain technology last summer. Carney said: "The underlying technology [blockchain] is actually of a fair bit of interest. We are working with it at the Bank of England." He further said that using blockchain technology for settlements between central banks would be the "most interesting application" that would benefit financial stability and efficiency. As reported in September 2017, Simon Scorer, a researcher at BoE, has publicly discussed the design requirements for a central bank-issued digital currency, saying it would need "extraordinary levels of resilience" against a range of problems. "Like current financial infrastructure, a widely used [central bank digital currency] would likely be considered critical national infrastructure.... It would need to be operational across the country, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year," he said at the time.

coindesk	uk-crypto-trader-forced-to-hand-over-bitcoin-at-gunpoint	UK Crypto Trader Forced to Hand Over Bitcoin at Gunpoint - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T15:30	A British man who runs a cryptocurrency trading firm was yesterday forced at gunpoint to hand over an unknown quantity of bitcoin. The incident, which reportedly took place in the village of Moulsford in South Oxfordshire, is said to be the first bitcoin heist in the country. It was reported to the local police on Monday morning, a Telegraph report states. According to a police spokesperson: "Thames Valley Police is investigating an aggravated burglary which occurred at a property in Moulsford on Monday. No one was seriously injured during the incident.... No arrests have been made at this stage." The report describes how four robbers forcefully entered the residence and tied up a woman, while demanding that the trader, named as Danny Aston, transfer bitcoin at gunpoint. Aston's cryptocurrency trading firm was established in June 2017, as Aston Digital Currencies Ltd. This is not the first case of armed robbery involving bitcoin. A similar incident was reported in Ottawa, Canada, on 23rd Jan. In that crime, three armed men gained control over employees of a bitcoin financial institution before fleeing empty-handed, as previously reported by CoinDesk. One suspect has been charged by the local police following bitcoin heist and two more of the accused robbers are being sought. The charges include robbery with a firearm and forcible confinement.

coindesk	ukrainian-central-bank-expanding-blockchain-team	The Ukrainian Central Bank Is Expanding Its Blockchain Team - CoinDesk	2017-12-04T10:00	The National Bank of Ukraine is expanding the team working to move the country's national currency, the hyrvnia, to a blockchain. Revealed in an email to CoinDesk, the number of people added and who they are is being kept private for now, but the expansion shows a level of intent that hasn't been seen at many other central banks. "Today, we've reinforced our team with world-class professionals and are optimistic that the project will get a boost in upcoming months," wrote Yakiv Smolii, acting governor of the central bank. While the details of the team were not made public, CoinDesk last week reported that Ukraine-based Distributed Lab is helping with the build. Distributed Lab's founder, Pavel Kravchenko, confirmed that the startup is at least partly "responsible for [the] architecture, blockchain research and development and security analysis" of the institution's initiative. Central banks across the globe have been discussing and exploring blockchain technology for its ability to more efficiently track funds and reduce the expenses of commercial banks. For instance, the People's Bank of China has deemed the creation of a fiat-based cryptocurrency a " crucial " financial development. But still, the National Bank of Ukraine gave a more detailed vision of its undertaking to create a "national digital currency," that makes its work less theoretical than others. According to Smolii: "National bank of Ukraine is looking forward to implementation of e-hryvnia based on blockchain technology. We consider blockchain as the next step in evolution of transactions technologies, which will become more popular and widespread during the next decades." 'Convenient' money The central bank formally began working on a blockchain-based system in November 2016 to develop a "cashless economy." While the results of the earlier research were not disclosed, Smolli told CoinDesk, the project is now "focused on studying the ability of the central bank to establish [an] operational e-hryvnia solution which would be available 24/7 and easy-to-use for all stakeholders." In this way, the central bank is now working to build a more "convenient instrument" for Ukrainian citizens and businesses to conduct any number of transactions. Displaying how determined the central bank is to move forward with the project, the National Bank of Ukraine has begun surveying commercial banks in the country, in an effort to understand their "readiness" to "support the circulation" of a national fiat currency riding on a blockchain. The central bank is also looking at best practices employed by other blockchain users around the world. "We have spent some time in additional study of international best practices and existing technologies," Smolli wrote, adding: "We remain confident of the need to introduce national digital money."

coindesk	uks-fca-chief-warns-bitcoin-investors-be-prepared-to-lose-your-money	UK's FCA Chief Warns Bitcoin Investors: Be Prepared to Lose Your Money - CoinDesk	2017-12-15T10:05	The head of a British financial regulator has warned that people stand to lose their funds if they invest in bitcoin. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told the BBC's Newsnight program that buying bitcoin poses similar risks to gambling and, since it is neither backed by central authorities nor regulated, the cryptocurrency is not a safe investment. Talking to Newsnight, he continued: "It is a very volatile commodity in terms of its pricing... If you want to invest in bitcoin be prepared to lose your money – that would be my serious warning." Bailey went on to say that "commodities" like bitcoin are not regulated by financial watchdogs in the U.K., and that it was up to parliament to decide on any changes in those rules. However, citing the recent U.S. launch of bitcoin futures contracts by CBOE, he said: "If you buy a future or if you buy an option then we do come into the picture." The FCA's director of strategy and competition, Chris Woolard, addressed the same subject back in June, cautioning investors that, as cryptocurrencies are not regulated financial instruments, they do not have the consumer protections associated with traditional assets. And, in September, the authority also issued a formal warning on initial coin offerings (ICOs) stating that they constitute "very high-risk, speculative investments."

coindesk	un-agencies-turn-to-blockchain-in-fight-against-child-trafficking	UN Agencies Turn to Blockchain In Fight Against Child Trafficking - CoinDesk	2017-11-13T10:00	The United Nations has partnered with the World Identity Network (WIN) to develop a blockchain identity pilot aimed to help curb child trafficking. Announced during the Humanitarian Blockchain Summit in New York on Friday, the pilot involves participation from the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the United Nations Office of Information and Communications Technology (UN-OICT), a press release indicates. Storing digital identities on a blockchain, the release states, provides a "significantly higher chance of catching traffickers." Additionally, securing identity data on an immutable ledger will make trafficking attempts "more traceable and preventable." According to Dr. Mariana Dahan, co-founder and CEO of WIN, "invisible" children under the age of five and who do not possess a birth certificate are at "risk" and can fall into the hands of child traffickers. These children are often missed by social programs offered by governments or development agencies. She added: "Several developing countries are actively looking at more efficient ways to prevent child trafficking. Identification is always at the heart of the solution." Child trafficking uses fake identification documents to transport young people across borders for eventual forced participation in serious illicit activities including the sex trade, the illegal human organ trade, and others. Yannick Glemarec, UN women deputy executive director said, "Child trafficking is one of the greatest human rights abuses." Blockchain, she continued, would be a "potentially powerful" technology to address the problem and potentially save "millions of children." In a move to foster the pilot, the partners are seeking support from private companies, NGOs, academia, and others that are willing to contribute to help end child trafficking. Plans were also revealed for the launch of a "Global Challenge" that would seek ideas and expertise in using blockchain for humanitarian projects.

coindesk	uncle-sams-surprise-tax-reform-impact-crypto-investors	Uncle Sam's Surprise: Tax Reform to Impact Crypto Investors - CoinDesk	2017-12-13T13:15	The U.S. tax code is on the brink of its largest overhaul in three decades. And while neither the House of Representatives or Senate version of the tax bill (both have passed in their respective chambers and are in the process of being reconciled into a final bill) specifically addresses cryptocurrency, several rule changes could potentially catch bitcoin holders who realized eye-popping gains in 2017 by surprise. So far, both versions scrap the "like-kind" exchange mechanism that many cryptocurrency holders have used in the past and the Senate version proposes a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) accounting framework, which could complicate cryptocurrency token reporting. Yet, the proponents of the reform, including President Donald Trump and the majority of Republicans on Capitol Hill, argue the goal is to make paying Uncle Sam far less torturous of a process for everyone. Representative David Schweikert, the Arizona Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and the Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxation, told CoinDesk: "With a more simplified tax code, individuals will be able to navigate the challenges that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies face with more ease." Unfortunately for crypto-holders, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act – of which Rep. Schweikert is a co-sponsor – was left out of both versions. Neither version modifies existing capital gains tax rates, which cryptocurrency is subject to pursuant to the IRS' 2014 guidance. Swapping crypto Yet, the final bill will almost certainly do away with a crypto-friendly maneuver – deferring capital gains taxes on property by swapping one asset for a similar asset via a so-called 1031 like-kind exchange. Employing such exchanges has been a common tactic in crypto trading circles in years past, but both the House and Senate bills limit this provision solely to real estate transactions. "A lot of people have been taking the position that when they swap tokens from one type of token to another type of token or one cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency, that’s a like-kind exchange," said Lisa Zarlenga, partner at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, D.C. and co-chair of the firm's tax group. By swapping between cryptos, asset owners forego the short-term capital gains tax – the same as ordinary income tax rates – and then pay a lower long-term capital gains tax rate of 20 percent when the asset is sold. According to Kelsey Lemaster, partner at Goodwin Procter in San Francisco, while current law is unclear whether this like-kind mechanism can be applied to cryptocurrencies, a good argument could be made for it in the case of swaps of assets that originate from the same blockchain, such as bitcoin to bitcoin cash. "But then if the proposals go through, they would eliminate the ability to take this position on any exchange of crypto," Lemaster said. First in, first out What is more of a wild card, though, the FIFO accounting mechanism for "specified securities" could have the biggest potential impact on cryptocurrency holders. The requirement, only a provision within the Senate version, means that, as it relates to determining the cost basis of an asset sold, the oldest goods in one's inventory would be the first to be sold. "Normally, what you would do is tell your broker to sell the highest-cost ones first. What [the Senate] is proposing is that you can’t use that anymore, that you have to use first-in, first-out," said Jim Calvin, tax partner at Deloitte, explaining: "So, the first stuff that you bought would have to be the first stuff that you were treated as selling." As an example, if a person bought one bitcoin at $1,000 in 2013 and another at $10,000 last month, and then decides to sell one at $15,000, that individual must sell the one bought first – the $1,000 one – and realize $14,000 worth of taxable gains (what they'd likely rather do is sell the $10,000 one first, and realize only $5,000 of taxable gains). While the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has categorized bitcoin a commodity, many wonder whether this provision, since it only applies to securities, would affect bitcoin. According to Calvin, bitcoin will likely get caught up in this, because bitcoin futures started trading this week. And even if bitcoin gets a pass, Zarlenga contends several initial coin offering (ICO) issuers, who have designed their tokens as securities, plus the issuers the SEC continues to go after, will fall under the FIFO umbrella. "You can have tokens that have enough qualities of a security to be treated as a security for tax purposes," she said. Silver lining As daunting as FIFO may be, though, it’s not certain that the provision will be in the final bill signed into law. Since the House and Senate are currently reconciling their respective drafts, and FIFO was only in the Senate's version, it could very well be axed. Especially since many powerful interests, such as the Investment Company Institute – which represents firms in the regulated funds business – are calling for its removal. Yet, even if it does stay on the bill, there's some good news on the FIFO front, according to Deloitte's Calvin. For one, the provision only applies account-by-account, meaning that if the oldest bitcoins an individual owns are stored in a separate account from the bitcoins they want to sell or better yet, outside of an exchange account altogether, the rule does not apply. "If you sell bitcoin (in 2018), you’re going to be treated as selling the first one that you bought," Calvin said. "So, take it off the exchange, hold it directly and when you want to sell one, you can deliver the one you want to sell." Practicing what he preaches, Calvin added, that he personally is taking all his crypto off of exchanges before the end of the year. Going a step further, Lemaster said traders may want to consider selling off a significant chunk of their crypto holdings before the end of the year to minimize the capital gains realized. He concluded: "If people are planning to sell bitcoins in the near future, it might be worthwhile for them to sell before the beginning of the year."

coindesk	us-defense-bill-give-big-boost-blockchain	US Defense Bill Could Give Big Boost to Blockchain - CoinDesk	2017-11-23T11:00	An obscure provision tucked into a defense spending bill could serve as a springboard for blockchain adoption across U.S. government agencies. Part of a larger bill called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT) will allow the public sector to redirect cost savings (which normally must be returned to the Treasury Department) into internal working capital funds that can be used to upgrade their IT systems. It authorizes agencies to use the working capital funds for modernization projects that fall into one of three buckets: cybersecurity, migrating legacy systems to the cloud and "other innovative platforms and technologies." As such, while blockchain is not explicitly mentioned in MGT's text, it fits into the letter of the law's parameters and objectives to advance the technology beyond the proof-of-concept stage at the agency level. Based on what U.S. government officials have said in the past, Trey Hodgkins, senior vice president of public sector at the Information Technology Industry Council in Washington, D.C., told CoinDesk: "Blockchain was clearly one of the technological capabilities that Congress meant for agencies to look at, and what they were trying to do was create dollars with some flexibility to them so that agencies would have their own discretion on what they invest in." Far from being held up in legislation, however, the MGT could soon have an impact. The NDAA has been passed by both the House of Representatives and Senate, and is awaiting President Donald Trump's signature, at which point it would become law. Blockchain catalyst Companies looking to provide enterprise blockchain services to the public sector echoed Hodgkins' optimism that the act could provide a pathway toward increased funding and experimentation at the governmental level. "We are excited about the MGT Act because it provides incentives to federal agencies to move away from high-cost, low performing legacy systems toward new technologies, like blockchain and smart contracts," said Todd Miller, U.S. markets lead at ChromaWay, a hybrid blockchain database provider in the process of opening a Washington D.C. office. Jeremy Wilcox, managing director for public sector at technology consultancy ClearEdge Partners, said the act could be a "catalyst" for the technology, even if agencies were to only redirect a small percentage of the funds toward blockchain. The flexibility afforded by the MGT could also give agencies some workaround to a congressional appropriations process that has been marred by political logjam. Rather than passing annual budgets, Congress, in recent years, has passed a series of appropriations bills that temporarily extend what was authorized in the prior period. This dynamic has hamstrung agency's efforts to secure funding for technology upgrades. "Sadly, it's a completely dysfunctional process, and for newer technologies, it's really challenging to get an agency to the point where they have the ability to plan for and design and architect, and then go out and buy something and then deploy it," said Hodgkins. MGT could change that dynamic by giving agencies more discretion in deciding which technology upgrades to pursue and how to go about paying for them. Speaking to this flexibility, Wilcox told CoinDesk: "They won't have to go to Congress and say, 'Can we have a line item for blockchain in our budget?'" Hurdles remain But even though the MGT provides a window of opportunity for blockchain within government "modernization" projects, the technology must demonstrate it has utility at an enterprise level before agencies can fully embrace it. While cloud computing and relational databases are proven in their reliability, their capacity to scale and their ability to replace existing legacy systems at a large organization like a government agency, blockchain solutions still have a ways to go in demonstrating that same level of credibility. Government agencies are, after all, still grappling with the cybersecurity risks associated with blockchain. In a separate section, the NDAA stipulates that the Pentagon monitor government agency adoption of blockchain for cybersecurity risks and provide a briefing to Congress within 180 days. The bill states the Secretary of Defense must provide Congress with: "[A]n assessment of the use or planned use of such technologies by the Federal Government and critical infrastructure networks." This briefing must also include assessments of the technology’s use by foreign powers and criminal and extremist groups, but also "a description of potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies." The latter item displays the government's interest in taking advantage of blockchain technologies unique features to modernize cybersecurity practices. "If blockchain is tied to modernization then it could be a part of that solution," said Wilcox, concluding: "Time will tell. It's going to come down to what solutions or services are delivered."

coindesk	us-government-lab-blockcypher-tap-blockchain-for-p2p-energy-transactions	US Government Lab Looks to Blockchain for P2P Energy - CoinDesk	2018-01-24T11:00	Blockchain startup BlockCypher has partnered with a U.S. Department of Energy lab to develop solutions allowing energy transactions to be settled across multiple blockchains. The energy agency's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and BlockCypher first plan to demonstrate peer-to-peer energy transactions involving distributed energy resources (DER) over the dash cryptocurrency network between two test homes in the NREL's energy facility, said Dylan Cutler, senior engineer for the initiative at NREL. He said in a release: "Blockchain technology presents a transformative and highly scalable platform for enabling distributed energy markets, which could enable DER to interact more effectively with the larger grid. These interactions include more efficient demand response, capacity reserves, power quality support." According to Karen Hsu, head of growth at BlockCypher, people can exchange renewable energy peer to peer with the project's technology. "This would be important in a natural disaster or when the grid goes down for extended periods, just like weve seen last year across the U.S.," she said. The solution – which is planned to be blockchain agnostic – would also help streamline energy consumption by matching power generation with demand, and reducing power deficits during times of high energy usage, Hsu added. Smart meters with the ability to exchange cryptocurrency for electricity could also make the grid "more efficient and stable by enabling the monetization of stored energy and energy production at the endpoints of the grid," said Dash Core's CEO, Ryan Taylor. Globally, Australian, Japanese, and European energy providers have been starting to develop blockchain-based energy projects in recent months. Further, a research lab within the U.S. Department of Energy revealed last October that it is exploring the application of blockchain in managing next-generation power grids. In January 2017, the agency began publicly soliciting blockchain research proposals for "novel concepts for energy systems that rely on blockchain."

Making the announcement last week before the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Carl Imhoff, a manager at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), said that the technology has the potential to facilitate new ways of exchanging energy in a peer-to-peer fashion. Disclosing that the research lab is actively investigating this application of the technology, he told committee members: "PNNL is currently working with DOE and industry partners to determine the optimal use of such resilient data concepts as blockchain in emerging market constructs such as transactive energy." Blockchain, he explained in a prepared statement, "could be a part of grid modernization efforts, encourage distributed power generation and storage systems, and help secure emerging market constructs." The potential of blockchain in revamping energy systems is currently being explored by both startups and established businesses worldwide, with its decentralized nature offering a new way to distribute or fund sources of power. Further, The Department of Energy is no stranger to blockchain.

coindesk	us-medical-board-group-launches-blockchain-certification-pilot	US Medical Board Group Launches Blockchain Certification Pilot - CoinDesk	2017-11-06T17:45	A national non-profit group for state medical boards is launching a new blockchain pilot focused on digital certifications. The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) announced today that it would be the latest organization to test the use of Blockcerts, an open-source standard built on top of bitcoin that developed by Learning Machine Technologies and the MIT Media Lab. The non-profit used the tech to create digital records for both undergraduate and graduate medical certification credentials. Though most of the groups to date to try out the standard have been academic institutions, the FSMB's pilot represents a notable use case in the medical field. The FSMB dates back to the early 20th century and counts the 70 state medical and osteopathic regulatory boards within the U.S. Materials published online suggest that the pilot began last month, though it's unclear at this time whether the FSMB will consider any applications of the tech beyond the scope of the pilot. "Verification of medical education and related credentials is a critically important endeavor, and we are hopeful that the continued success of this pilot may provide the level of certainty needed to implement blockchain technologies in the medical licensing and credentialing process," Michael Dugan, the FMSB's chief information officer, said in a statement.

coindesk	utility-token-exemption-sought-in-new-wyoming-blockchain-bill	Wyoming Lawmakers Want Exemptions for ICO Utility Tokens - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T16:25	Lawmakers in Wyoming have filed a bill that, if approved, would exempt some creators and sellers of blockchain tokens from securities regulations. The bill, which according to public records has a total of 12 sponsors signed on thus far, would exclude "a developer or seller" from the applicable securities laws provided they meet certain conditions. Namely, that the token they're offering isn't being offered as an investment and that the token can be exchanged for something – in other words, that it has some kind of utility. The exemption would also only apply in the event that the seller or developer "has not entered into a repurchase agreement of any kind or 12 entered into an agreement to locate a buyer for the token." Additionally, the Wyoming bill also lays out an exemption from being classified as a broker-dealer in relation to the token, provided that they meet the standards listed above. Certain parties are excluded from the bill, namely banks and other financial institutions such as credit unions and savings and loan associations. Past legislative efforts have focused on easing the regulatory environment around uses and development of the tech. In January of last year, for example, lawmakers filed a bill that would make digital currencies a permissible investment for money transmitters. Public records show that the effort ultimately failed to pass.

coindesk	virginia-lawmakers-seek-study-on-government-blockchain-use	Virginia Lawmakers Seek Study on Government Blockchain Use - CoinDesk	2018-01-24T16:00	Lawmakers in the U.S. state of Virginia hope to form a study group that would research the impact of implementing blockchain technology across some government services. Introduced on Jan. 23, a new House Joint Resolution, if enacted, would establish a subcommittee to explore how blockchain could improve government operations including in areas such as state record-keeping, information storage and service delivery. According to the proposal, the detailed scope of the study would include examining how feasible it would be to implement the technology, as well as coming up with a realistic estimated timeline and impact assessment for the implementation. Other focuses may also cover case study research and how existing laws can be amended to foster blockchain development in Virginia. So far, the bill has been referred to Committee on Rules, records show. According to the bill, while the study group is not likely to receive an official budget for its costs, the House of Delegates would create a cryptocurrency wallet for private donations to fund the work. The new legislative initiative comes just a few days after the state's senate introduced another bill that would launch a study of the impact of cryptocurrencies on the lives of Virginia's inhabitants – perhaps signaling increasing interest from lawmakers in exploring blockchain's potential to advance its information technology capacity. Meanwhile, a similar growth of interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can also be seen in the neighboring state of West Virginia. Also introduced on Jan. 23, a new House Resolution requests that West Virginia's Joint Committee on Government and Finance "study bitcoin, its future and potential impact on the state, its citizens, and businesses." The bill is currently before the House Banking & Insurance Committee.

coindesk	visa-cracks-bitcoin-debit-cards-europe-providers-say	Crypto Debit Card Providers Hit After Visa Cuts Ties With Issuer - CoinDesk	2018-01-05T17:00	Visa, the payments giant, terminated a card issuer's membership on Friday, causing cryptocurrency debit card providers to suspend their services, according to three of the affected companies. Bitcoin payments processor BitPay announced in a statement that its European card issuer, WaveCrest Holdings, Ltd., had been told by Visa to close its accounts. The company will refund any remaining balances, as well as card order fees for anyone who purchased a card after Dec. 1, 2017. According to BitPay: "Yesterday our European BitPay Card issuer WaveCrest Holdings, Ltd. received direction from Visa® to immediately close all accounts of its prepaid Visa® debit card programs. The BitPay Card (non-US) is one of these programs, along with other cryptocurrency-related and standard prepaid Visa® debit cards. Unfortunately, WaveCrest was unable to provide us or cardholders with more time to prepare for this change." Similarly, payment providers Cryptopay and Bitwala announced they would be ceasing their services and returning remaining funds. Berlin-based Bitwala said on Twitter that its team was holding an emergency meeting to discuss the issue. However, London-based Cryptopay announced in a subsequent tweet that it had already begun negotiating with another card issuer. Similarly, BitPay said in its statement that it was “already in discussions with potential alternative issuers.” Notably, the shutdowns is limited to European consumers. BitPay stated that U.S. customers would not experience any disruptions. In a statement, a Visa Europe spokesperson said WaveCrest had lost its membership with the payments company "due to non-compliance with [its] operating rules." As a result, all Visa cards issued by the company were closed. Other Visa card issuers can continue to issue cryptocurrency-based cards. Less than a year ago, BitPay announced it was expanding to 131 countries at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference. Its cards allow users to fill their balances with cryptocurrencies, but spend in euros, British pounds, or U.S. dollars. In a statement, WaveCrest CEO Brent Almeida said: "We have already notified our partners and cardholders of Visa's requirement to close these accounts and our first priority is to ensure the safe and timely return of all funds. We deeply regret the inconvenience that this has caused to all of our customers affected by this decision. WaveCrest's business outside of its Visa membership remains unaffected and we continue to invest in delivering world-class B2B payment solutions to partners around the world."

coindesk	vitalik-first-part-ethereums-sharding-roadmap-nearly-done	Part One of Ethereum's Sharding Roadmap Is Nearly Done - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T17:10	Ethereum is getting closer to deploying new technology that would allow the network to scale, its founder said. "It seems like part one of phase one is getting something like being already done," Vitalik Buterin said in a developer meeting. The technology, known as sharding, attempts to split the ethereum blockchain's data into more manageable parts. Pointing to an initial spec posted on Github, Buterin said: "It's theoretically a good spec of what minimal sharding is going to look like." Ethereum is under pressure to keep up with the rising popularity of the platform, which has led to slower transaction times and high processing fees. The congestion has already led some token-based projects to build atop other blockchains such as Stellar. Buterin went to state that the next phase of the four-stage scaling proposal will be completed in "a month and a bit," adding that development work will likely circulate on stateless clients, a type of ethereum software that does not need to process the complete history of the platform. "Then from there we're going to try and shard it into a working test, a kind of test network," the ethereum founder said. In the meeting, Buterin also reflected on Casper, ethereum's new consensus protocol that is currently in testing. As detailed by CoinDesk, the test network has been derailed by issues with the software it deploys. However, Buterin said that in spite of hiccups, the core of the project is sound, or as he put it: "the Casper aspect of Casper… is totally successful." Still, with the code yet to be adapted for use across different ethereum software clients, he acknowledged: "That's on a bit of a back burner for now."

coindesk	vivid-history-money-got-free-untold-story-bitcoin	Vivid History: 'How Money Got Free' Is the Untold Story of Bitcoin - CoinDesk	2017-09-24T11:10	An early bitcoin developer and entrepreneur, Alex Waters served as COO and CIO for bitcoin exchange startup BitInstant. Later going on to start several bitcoin ventures, he was also at the forefront of efforts to boost its regulatory compliance. In this opinion piece, Waters reviews "How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance" (Oneworld Publications), arguing it captures the zeitgeist of the original cryptocurrency and the sprawling – all too human – movement that helped it reach the masses. I have long suspected, owing to its sheer brilliance and idiosyncratic beauty, that bitcoin was in fact brought here by aliens from another planet. Brian Patrick Eha's vivid history of bitcoin, " How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance," which captures in thrilling journalistic fashion what I experienced in my years working on this remarkable technology, only confirms my suspicions. I regret not recording what I saw and felt while working on bitcoin — the fleeting moments of intense joy and dismay that once seemed too meaningful ever to forget. But at the time, it was all I could do to keep up with the pace, and my life became a blur of 80-hour working weeks devoted to the engineering project of a lifetime. As the years passed, and the blockchain industry exploded, it seemed that these beautiful moments of intellectual adventure would remain only as fading memories, slowly dimming as I aged. The idea that an author could capture the essence of that stirring time seemed impossible even in my most optimistic moments. Yet, just as I had initially done with bitcoin, I came to find in reading Eha's book that I had underestimated once again. From the top Eha starts at the beginning, sparing no detail. The era he eloquently describes was an alternate reality which brought together the brightest, hardest-working and most ideologically extreme individuals I have ever known. We shared common goals and an outsider camaraderie that only grew stronger as we made progress in the early years of bitcoin's ascendance. Looking back, it's sobering to realize that some of us were imprisoned or otherwise suffered as a result of the desire to improve and promote this new kind of money. For some of my fellow pioneers, the intensity of their ideological commitments became a prison in itself. Early bitcoiners collectively witnessed the radical dismantling of tribal and national affiliations, and the formation, in their place, of a new global citizenry. The birth of bitcoin and its blockchain was an important moment in human history – one whose legacy deserves to be documented. "How Money Got Free" is precisely what I was yearning to read. The fascinating detail and precise vocabulary of Eha's writing provide a sense of closure for me personally. It feels cathartic to now possess a tome which records the visceral thrill of bitcoin's rise, the earthshaking import of its innovations. As I read, I felt as though I were in the room witnessing the breakthroughs made by the first bitcoin pioneers. The truth is, I have crossed paths with many of the characters depicted in the book. Some of them were in close proximity to me for nearly a decade. Until now, I didn't know why these people had joined the bitcoin community or how fate had guided us to share in this wonderful experiment. While I was busy working on cash remittance at BitInstant, I had very little insight into what others were working on in parallel. The challenges faced by Coinbase, Blockchain, BitPay, SecondMarket and others were just brief news headlines to me at the time, like billboards flashing past on the highway. I had little appreciation for the depth of their intensity or the richness of the stories behind those headlines – all of which is conveyed in full through Eha's narrative. Consequently, "How Money Got Free" has changed my perspective on many of those people, some of whom I once thought of as competitors. What I've since learned is that we were all in the same boat, whatever our individual aims. Bitcoin itself is, in some sense, our parent organization, and its furtherance benefits us all. Eha interviewed me for his book, as he did many of my former colleagues and acquaintances. When I asked what had motivated him to write it, he said that he wanted to shine a light on the pioneers and preserve the history of bitcoin's formative years. (His book, which is both a work of investigative journalism and a tremendous feat of storytelling, focuses mainly on the period from 2009–2015, though Eha also examines bitcoin's precursors, and an epilogue brings his narrative almost to the present day.) The martyrs, explorers, creators, and pariahs who champion new technologies and advance society, Eha told me, are often overlooked or soon fall into obscurity. While every frontier has to be settled eventually, the lessons learned during the rough-and-tumble days are important – so that future projects are inoculated against failure by the hardships of the past. Untold stories "How Money Got Free" transports readers to the meeting rooms, startup couches, conference halls, online discussion boards and proverbial watercoolers where the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry took shape. It guides readers through the history of bitcoin's implementation and explains its potential for the future. Whether you are a bitcoin believer or a skeptic, Eha's work will arm you with a deeper knowledge not only of the technology but of the human motives behind it. It is inspiring, evocative, and imbued with empathy for the dreamers – the "crazy ones," as Eha puts it in the book's dedication, echoing Steve Jobs – who move society forward. As the book makes clear, bitcoin would not be where is it today had it not been for all of the people who clicked on a link, who read an article, who discussed, built, argued and invested. Small in themselves, each of these actions shaped our future; they contributed to the momentum of where we are going. Naturally, our past informs our choice of what to write, what to click, with whom to argue and what to say. Just so, early bitcoiners tended to have philosophical or political reasons for being drawn to cryptocurrency, and Eha is splendid at delving into primary sources and tracing the wellsprings of these convictions. As we express ourselves through the use of these new technologies – the Internet, email, text messaging, social networks, blockchains – we stand to benefit from weighing the long-term implications of even our smallest interactions. It is crucial for us to recognize and reflect on the journeys made and efforts undertaken to bring us our current way of life. But while some figures loom larger than others, every person who participates in bitcoin, even conceptually, is taking an implied risk. It carries social, legal, and financial consequences regardless of success. That risk and the willingness to take it, in the interest of furthering humanity, is what binds us together. Eha's book reminds me of something Faulkner once wrote: "The past is never dead. It's not even past." Even now, it informs our actions, and we need to understand it if we want to understand where we are going. "How Money Got Free" conveys the essence of bitcoin's past – not preserved in amber but alive with color and controversy. For non-geeks, reading this book may be the first step toward acceptance of our inevitable future. It can serve as a permanent record for those who weren't around to witness the events first-hand, and as an inspiration for all the dreamers still captivated by a transcendence which rivals the internet itself.

coindesk	wall-street-veterans-raise-50-million-crypto-fund-funds	Wall Street Vets Raise $50 Million for Crypto Fund of Funds - CoinDesk	2018-01-26T13:15	Sitting at his desk at Credit Suisse, Sina Nader watched the bottom fall out of the global economy. As a junior associate helping manage a $100 million portfolio of equities, he had a first-hand view of the 2007-2008 collapse from the Swiss bank's Los Angeles offices and recalls frantically taking screenshots of the price as Lehman Brothers' stock collapsed to "essentially zero." "My first thought was, 'Holy shit, some traders just took out Lehman,'" Nader told CoinDesk. "My next thought was, 'Holy shit, if the fifth-largest investment bank in America can be taken out like this, is the banking system actually safe?'" Likening it to the feeling kids get when they learn Santa Claus isn't real, Nader says that the day changed him forever – and eventually sent him into the wild world of cryptocurrency. After going down the crypto rabbit hole, Nader, who's also worked for Morgan Stanley, teamed up with a former private wealth analyst at Morgan Stanley, Jacob Kirschenbaum, and others to launch Cryptolux Capital, a crypto fund of funds. And revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Nader has secured about $50 million of the $100 million the fund is seeking. While the number of crypto hedge funds has grown from about 124 in October to 175 today, Nader positions his experience in one of the traditional financial system's worst hours as the key to Cryptolux's success. "I look back to what I saw in the financial services world, and that really sets the stage for me to be excited about crypto," Nader said. "When you're watching the five biggest investment banks in the country either go out of business or change their entire business model, you realize that the banking system is not as strong as many people may have believed it was." He continued: "I've got this view that this banking system is not infallible, and wouldn't it be nice if there was a system that went around, or was outside of the banking system for the use of wealth?" Have some humility According to Nader, Cryptolux is designed specifically to take advantage of the lessons he learned, in an effort to offset the downside risks of the volatile cryptocurrency market. At the heart of that is Nader's captivation by bitcoin’s ability to store value outside the traditional banking system. If the financial sector buckles again, bitcoin won't go down with it. But as he started looking at crypto hedge funds more broadly, he saw a number of cryptocurrencies and funds diversifying in the cryptocurrency space outperforming bitcoin itself by as much as 200 percent. So, he started talking to other investors and coming up with a strategy that would capture those huge gains. And Cryptolux believes it's found that strategy in a targeted fund-screening process that looks for an attribute he contends is all too rare among today's cryptocurrency speculators, just as it was in investors before the financial collapse: humility. "Anyone who really claims to know exactly what is going to happen in the crypto space is probably misguided at best," Nader said, adding: "So I think it's important to come at this space with a strong amount of humility, because I think it will inform your investment strategy and ultimately your trading." Look to the futures The second way Nader aims to offset downside risk is by further hedging with cryptocurrency futures options. Nader said, initially the fund will establish short positions in the nascent bitcoin futures market. In the event of a market correction or pullback, he expects the bitcoin futures position will increase, providing Cryptolux with a buffer against the dips. Currently, Cryptolux is only investing in bitcoin futures, but Nader expects to add ether futures should that product get approved by regulators. Hinting at which hedge funds Cryptolux is mixing into its fund of funds, Nader said he’s "excited" about Silver 8 Capital and MultiCoin Capital, though he's keeping an eye open for changes in the strategies of the fund managers over time, and could modify his own fund's composition accordingly. And going forward, Nader said the firm will be exploring the possibility of expanding its investments to include proprietary positions in crypto startups and other blockchain-related companies. For interested investors, there’s a $1 million minimum to join, with a 1 percent management fee and a 15 percent carry on money made from the investment. By early next month, Nader expects to reveal further details about the company’s risk management program along with other new features. And if all goes as planned, he hopes to raise a second fund targeting $125 million. According to Nadar, he’s primed to do it, saying: "Our view of what our value-add is, is we give you a diversified portfolio and we take care of the risk management component on top of that."

coindesk	walmart-jd-com-back-blockchain-food-tracking-effort-china	Walmart, JD.com Back Blockchain Food Tracking Effort in China - CoinDesk	2017-12-14T05:00	Retail giants Walmart and JD.com are among several companies backing a new blockchain effort in China focused on food safety and traceability. Along with Tsinghua University National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies and IBM, the four parties have created the Blockchain Food Safety Alliance, which will seek to connect businesses along the food supply chain within the world's most populous country. The idea, according to statements, is to develop "a standards-based method of collecting data about the origin, safety and authenticity of food" among the parties involved, with blockchain serving as a technological basis for recording that information in real time. For Walmart, the effort represents an expansion of its previous work in the food supply chain area. In October 2016, the retailer unveiled that it was working with Tsinghua and IBM in an effort to track pork products, a process that the company called "very encouraging" during a presentation earlier this year. "As a global advocate for enhanced food safety, Walmart looks forward to deepening our work with IBM, Tsinghua University, JD and others throughout the food supply chain. Through collaboration, standardization, and adoption of new and innovative technologies, we can effectively improve traceability and transparency and help ensure the global food system remains safe for all," Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety and health for Walmart, said of the new group. The inclusion of JD.com – a business-to-consumer e-commerce platform that claimed more than 200 million users as of September – is a notable one, given its overall footprint in China. And reports that JD.com intends to import billions of dollars worth of food over the next several years would, in theory, create a large inventory of products to track. "Throughout the world, and particularly in China, consumers increasingly want to know how their food is sourced, and JD is dedicated to using technology to promote complete transparency," Yongli Yu, president of JD's supply chain research unit, said in a statement.

coindesk	weathering-altcoin-shitstorm-investing-next-one	Weathering the Altcoin Storm (And Investing for the Next) - CoinDesk	2018-01-08T06:30	Brendan Bernstein is a founding member of Tetras Capital Partners, LLC, an investment manager focused on investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets. The crypto market moves in cycles – and understanding these cycles is key to profiting, managing risk and keeping sane. Howard Marks describes two ways to profit from markets: (1) Hold more of the things that rise and less of the things that fall, and (2) cycle adjustment, or trying to have more risk exposure when markets rise and less when they fall. Most people ignore the second part. Yet the key to cycle adjustment is understanding where you are in the cycle and calibrating the risks and rewards to account for it. Similar to the broader economy, we have both short and long-term cycles. Short-term cycles are driven by the capital flows, investor composition and market sentiment. Long-term cycles result from the aggregate effects of the short-term cycles and ultimately are driven by long-term fundamentals. The past few months in context Over the last few months, the market has been driven by new capital entering the space and a psychological acceptance of bitcoin. The capital — both retail and institutional (i.e., new crypto hedge funds) — entered initially through the most liquid crypto assets and fiat currency onramps. Bitcoin, being the most liquid fiat onramp, has performed well. It was also the first asset many investors became comfortable with during that time. From July 1st to Dec. 10th, bitcoin dominance (or its percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization) increased from 41% to 66% – even as the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies was increasing outside of bitcoin. BTC's price increased from $2,492 to almost $20,000. I'll stress that this was not driven by fundamentals, but rather the capital flows and accessibility premium of bitcoin. New capital had a bias for bitcoin because it was the easiest to understand, custody and purchase. The short-term cycle moved in BTC's favor. The short-term crypto cycle in action Moving toward December, the market started to become more and more dominated by retail and – let's be honest – less crypto-educated capital. Coinbase is a great proxy for this phenomenon. From June to October, Coinbase signups were relatively constant at about30,000 per day. However, starting in early November, this number started to increase dramatically, exceeding 100,000 on some days. Initially, this capital continued to pour into bitcoin, putting fuel on the short-term cycle and building new investor sentiment in favor of BTC. BTC was going to $100,000, and by the time CNBC debuted its coveted "BTC Ticker," the pendulum had swung too far in BTC's direction. Larger investors started to take profits, bitcoin began to falter. It was time to find the next new shiny object… As capital moved out of bitcoin and into other assets, we saw the end of one short-term cycle and beginning of the next. Starting in early December, a new cycle began and the "cheaper" Coinbase assets stole the show. Capital that initially entered the crypto markets through BTC was finally comfortable with the crypto space and willing to move out on the risk curve. In other words, it was time to play with house money. The newer retail entrants cared less about fundamental protocol strength and were easily lured into a protocol's marketing pitch. These were not cypherpunks. BTC is archaic and overpriced to these investors. There is no EEA of bitcoin. No marketing team is pushing it. Why buy a $17,000 digital gold when you could buy a $100, faster alternative? In the first three weeks of December alone, litecoin increased 3.7x from $100 to $371 while BTC continued to lose ground. LTC, too, would have a fall from grace when longer-term LTC holders began to sell ( ahem Charlie ) and returns started to stagnate. These restless investors moved on once again with more house money to play with. Their attention moved from the roulette table that is Coinbase to the craps table that is Bittrex, Poloniex and Binance. As a result, signups on those exchanges skyrocketed, and Bittrex even had to close new user accounts. "Holy shit, even cheaper versions of BTC." Their marketing budgets lured them in with the siren call of lambos. It seems ridiculous to say, but the cheaper the asset, the greater the chance of a return. And when I said cheap, I'm not referring to a fundamental measure of value like a value investor would (P/BV, P/E, etc). I'm referring to its price. A chart of returns over the past seven days paints this picture. There's a direct negative correlation between the price of the token and return. It's scary, but it's unfortunately true. TRX, XRP, XLM, ADA, you name it. "Bitcoin 3.0." Faster, cheaper and more upside. Right? It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. BTC retreated 40% and overall dominance fell from 65% down to 37% this week. The fire was already smoldering. New retail investors were the gasoline. Preston Byrne said it best – cryptocurrencies have become the worlds largest penny stock casino. How to weather the shitcoin storm Investors trying to find fundamental value are ripping their eyes out. XRP, with legitimately zero fundamental usage (see below), just passed BTC in diluted market cap. Over the last day I’ve asked several people close to banks if banks are indeed planning to begin using Ripple’s token, XRP, in a serious way, which is what investors seem to assume when they buy in at the current XRP prices. This is a sampling of what I heard back: pic.twitter.com/zbfMqg4TpD — Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) January 5, 2018 IOTA has proven cryptographic flaws. What the hell is TRON? RaiBlocks went from a market cap of $30 million to $4 billion in a week. What. The. Fuck. Meanwhile, assets with real usage, actual code and strong development communities, like monero for example, have not moved. Are investors supposed to recognize the reality of the situation that, for the current market regime, fundamental protocol strength — adoption, code quality, tech talent, etc. — means less than the price of the asset and marketing budget. Should you go all-in on coins less than $1? Or do you stick to your guns, find value and weather the shitcoin storm? The answer comes down to understanding where we are the cryptocurrency cycle. Where we are – and how to profit The answer to investing is rarely black and white. It’s not "get in" or "get out." It's usually somewhere in the middle. When people are increasingly willing to take risk and fear of missing out (FOMO) is prevailing over any sense of security and analytical discipline, that's the time to be worried. When the fundamentally weakest assets are rallying the most and people are proclaiming BTC is dead, we're starting to near the end of a short-term, altcoin-dominated cycle. The problem is that investors tend to think of themselves as analytical, disciplined and contrarian, but the fact of the matter is that most tend to magnify cyclical moves. They cannot stomach the possibility they may miss out on gains. That is why predicting the exact top and bottom is so challenging. But doing so with exact precision is not necessary… Does anyone still talk about Bitcoin? — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 5, 2018 Howard Marks describes the strategy well: "No one can ascertain when we’re at the exact top or bottom, a key to successful investing lies in selling – or lightening up – when we’re closer to the top, and buying — or, hopefully, loading up — when we’re closer to the bottom." Profiting from the short-term market cycles is not predicated on owning 0 bitcoin at peak alt and 0 alts at peak BTC. The key is that when investor euphoria is widespread, we should lighten up on those assets which are expensive and be more aggressive with those that are cheap. The time to be overweight alts is at the beginning and middle of the altcoin cycle. Not towards the end. And the same generally holds true for bitcoin. It's about calibrating and balancing your allocation of capital in accordance with the current cycle and how aggressive or defensive you want to be. Meanwhile, amid the small-cap and altcoin euphoria, we're on the precipice of a major entrance of institutional capital to the space and the one place it is going is BTC. Family offices, large hedge funds and endowments will not be investing in Bcash. A BTC ETF will launch sooner than people think. A TRON one will not. To profit from these cycles, you need to first understand where we stand in it and then be able to act counter to it at the peaks and troughs. It's not easy. The only reason it's profitable is that because it's so hard. At first, you're bound to lose money as the cycle continues in its march to irrationality. But the cycle will always turn, and in crypto, we know it won't be long until it does. Those with large altcoin positions should be worried. When the cycle reaches its peak and begins to turn, smaller-cap, illiquid tokens will fall as fast as they've gone up. Liquidity will dry up fast and you will not be able to sell anywhere close to the quoted price. The market in altcoin terms is getting expensive and in BTC terms it's getting cheaper. It's time to start using altcoin gains to build up core, fundamentally strong positions. A walk down memory lane I'm not making this up. We've seen it happen before. This period is eerily similar to March 2017. "Bitcoin 2.0," ethereum, had recently launched on Coinbase, the EEA was getting cemented and a slew of conferences were created to promote etheruem. Why invest in digital gold when you could own a world computer? For three months, ETH dramatically increased in price as new retail investors poured into the space and quit their jobs to day trade after massive gains. ETH increased in price from $7 in December of 2016 to $391 by June of 2017. BTC dominance fell from 86% to 40%. We were on the precipice of " the flippening," after which many thought BTC would subsequently fall to zero. Until the music stopped. Investors were tapped out. ICOs slowed down and ETH started having scaling issues just as the price got ahead of itself. Institutional capital began to enter BTC. The BTC dominance cycle began to revert. Illiquid altcoins, some of the same ones the new retail investors have made their money from, fell dramatically. XVG fell from a peak of $0.006 down to $0.002, a 67% decline. XRP fell from $0.31 to $0.15, a 50% decline. This year isn’t the first time it's happened. Investors have been lured out of bitcoin into altcoins since the first ones launched. Since 2013, we’ve been seeing BTC dominance fall, only to regain most of the lost ground shortly thereafter. This cycle, too, will revert. What causes each cycle? Each aforementioned BTC cycle has a common thread: The investor base, partially driven by new capital, becomes enamored by an alternative asset or market narrative. The cycle is usually triggered by a legitimate change in fundamentals. And then, subsequently, it's taken to the extreme by investor behavior. Earlier in 2017, it was smart contract functionality and ICOs. Now, as BTC fees creep up and ETH is facing scaling issues, most of the coins that have increased in price are aiming to be cheaper, faster or more scalable. What we're actually seeing is a mini-Gartner hype cycle play out around a new market theme or narrative. New technology captures investor attention. Emotional influences cause investors to follow the herd and fear of missing out predominates. The cycle gets taken to its extreme until it can go no further. At one Point in the 1989 Japanese real estate bubble, the Imperial Palace in Japan was said to be worth more than the entire state of California,, things that don't make sense don't last....be careful out there — Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) January 4, 2018 How to prepare for the next altcoin cycle It goes without saying, but the current market regime is not fundamentally driven whatsoever, but is instead driven by narrative and investor sentiment. The market is a Keynesian beauty contest. It's crucial to practice second-level thinking— the question isn't just why a protocol is interesting, but why and when the market will find it interesting. The most profitable trades come from synthesizing views on the macro liquidity cycle, narrative and capital flows with micro-analysis into the crypto-economic tradeoffs and qualities of each protocol. Towards the end of each short-term cycle, instead of doubling down on what's been working — i.e. doubling down on altcoins right now — prepare for the turn of the next. When in a BTC cycle, the question to ask is: what narrative will be the crux of the next Gartner hype cycle? Where will the capital flow when the BTC cycle peaks, and what will be the catalyst? Fundamentally analyze each protocol and determine which will benefit most from a shift in narrative. Do your diligence. Make sure the code and underlying infrastructure is sound and protect your capital. When you inevitably find yourself thinking that BTC or [INSERT PROTOCOL HERE] can't be stopped, remember that we've been evolutionarily programmed to think pro-cyclically. It will be stopped. And the cycle will turn.

coindesk	wef-trials-blockchain-bid-boost-air-travel-security	WEF Trials Blockchain in Bid to Boost Air Travel Security - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T21:00	The World Economic Forum (WEF) is working with the Canadian and Dutch governments to pilot a digital identity project that focuses in part on blockchain. The Known Traveller Digital Identity initiative is aimed at using technologies like blockchain and biometrics to improve the security around international air travel. A prototype, developed in collaboration with professional services firm Accenture, was unveiled at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. The idea behind the concept is to provide travelers with greater control over their identifying information by eliminating the need for a central database. Rather, travelers would rely on a "permission-based distributed ledger" that would allow for the transfer of information about a traveler's background and where they've gone to, for example. The WEF claims that the ledger's use, if fully realized, would "enable pre-screening and facilitation fo compliant known travelers across borders." At the same time, that would potentially free up resources for other purposes. According to the group, an ever-swelling number of travelers – international travel is expected to climb to 1.8 billion people annually by 2013, per figures cited by the WEF – underlies the need for more efficient processes. John Moavenzadeh, a member of the WEF's Executive Committee, said in a statement: "With travellers providing access to verified personal biometric, biographic and historical travel data at their discretion, they can assist authorities to undertake risk assessments and pre-screening in advance: essentially verifying their identities and providing secure and seamless movement throughout their journey using biometric recognition technology." According to a report that summarizes the project, it has not yet been decided whether or not the personal data will be stored on the blockchain directly.

coindesk	whats-former-cia-lawyer-crypto-structuring-compliant-icos	What's a Former CIA Lawyer Doing in Crypto? - CoinDesk	2018-01-23T09:00	Russell Bruemmer is taking it upon himself to help token issuers construct compliant initial coin offerings (ICOs). While that might sound challenging in a space where the regulatory framework has not been formalized, Bruemmer is as prepared as anyone could be in his new role advising blockchain startup Applied Philosophy Labs (APL). A former top lawyer of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the former lead of the congressional affairs unit at the FBI, Bruemmer gained the relevant experience working for decades at for the law firm of WilmerHale, helping traditional companies structure their corporate governance. In recent years, he said, he was approached by a number of blockchain entrepreneurs trying to figure out if the token they wanted to issue was a security or not. As a result, by the time he retired from the firm in 2015, he had laid the foundation for his work advising startups more broadly. "[Bruemmer] seemed like exactly what I needed in the new venture," said APL founder David Levine. In a climate where the Securities and Exchange Commission has been cracking down on crypto token fundraising schemes, Bruemmer knows he has his work cut out for him. At APL specifically, he has helped the public benefit corporation draw up plans for a network of humanitarian companies that would sit underneath the parent entity and issue regulated cryptocurrency tokens. To fund the humanitarian companies, he helped create a template to comply with the SEC's Reg CF and Reg A+. The hope is that, eventually, this compliant structure will define a path to public offerings via an S-1 filing and S-3 filing. Bruemmer told CoinDesk: "We are using corporate and governance structures that will be familiar to, and thus comfortable for, our investors. This is another aspect of our intention to be transparent with our investors and regulators who have jurisdiction over our activities." And the first company that gets the treatment is solar power startup Indeco. A power play Indeco was one of the reasons Bruemmer was intrigued with APL in the first place, he told CoinDesk, since he already had an interest in how a compliant crypto token could incentivize the adoption of solar power. And so the crew got started. Speaking to Bruemmer's insight, Levine told CoinDesk: "Within a couple hours, we had mapped out the whole plan on how to build a regulatory compliant crypto." For Indeco's ICO, people can purchase an ethereum-based ERC-20 token pegged to a single watt of solar capacity. They are then being offered an ownership stake in assets installed with the funds, including solar panels, batteries and microgrids for decentralized energy distribution. "We've evolved from cryptocurrencies which are based solely on algorithms and trading values, etc. into something like Indeco, where the coin is actually going to equate to something that is more tangible," said Bruemmer, who now sits on Indeco's board. Earlier this month the company completed a $100,000 presale, as part of a broader ICO governed by Reg A+ that could eventually see the firm raising $50 million. "If it works … you will expand the amount of solar energy being produced by bringing together groups of people who can invest small amounts, not huge amounts, and then aggregate those small amounts and build systems that can then sell energy either to a utility or to a customer," Bruemmer said. Although APL was originally designed to house what are called " series LLCs," each with its own token, due to tax considerations the final structure of the subsidiaries could end up shifting to C Corps, which can offer unlimited stocks. Investor resistance If all that structuring doesn't sound complicated enough, Indeco's backstory is equally, if not more, complex. Prior to founding APL and Indeco, Levine founded Geostellar, a solar power startup like Indeco, except without the blockchain. By 2016, Geostellar was generating $3.6 million in annual revenue and had raised $27 million in venture capital, but even still, Levine was having trouble keeping the company going. To help put the company on more solid footing, Levine says he spent about $500,000 on legal fees, accounting fees and more last year, in an effort to raise $40 million in an ICO governed under Reg A+. But the company's secured creditors pushed back, Levine said. "They could block us from doing almost anything," he said. "And they were sending me cease-and-desist letters on the ICO, claiming they had to consent as our secured creditors." Levine was able to sidestep Geostellar's creditors' concerns by offering a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) on the equity crowdfunding site Republic (which recently began managing token sales). As part of the crowdfunding campaign, the company offered to those investors cryptocurrency called "zydeco," among other gifts including a "shoutout" on Facebook and a solar-powered happy hour. Levine raised $325,000 during that promotion. "The secured creditors and investors were challenging my authority to even offer free tokens, and generally criticizing everything I did," Levine said, adding, "Of course it turned out to be a huge success." Now Geostellar will be Indeco's first customer, Levine told CoinDesk. Which is one more client than most blockchain startups can boast. Then again, a struggling company with the same founder is not exactly an ideal source of revenue. Bruemmer, who chairs the conflict and audit committees of APL's board of directors, would not comment on Geostellar's history of financial struggles. But Levine said having the legal veteran on board will help Indeco navigate such complexities, telling CoinDesk: "Things were going to get weird, and we needed someone brilliant, unflappable, experienced and credible."

As in any growing business, you can tell this is happening when new third-party providers crop up with ever-more specialized services. In the ICO industry, that's the handful of platforms that have recently launched to support token issuers throughout the life of their sales – providing investor verification, receiving and managing money, securing funds and distributing the tokens (or simple agreements for future tokens, also called SAFTs) on issuers' behalf. In this way, the issuers themselves can focus on building their products without worrying about all the little details of the actual sale. The new vendors represent the first wave of ICO platforms in a market that will no doubt continue to evolve, with these providers increasingly specializing into niches. Just as the very structure of ICOs themselves is an ongoing conversation – for instance, Blockstack prioritized broad reach with its token sale, skipping the private presale altogether, whereas the Sliver.TV ICO of "theta" only had a private sale, canceling its public sale after it hit its hard cap – these platforms for launching token sales are also emphasizing different aspects of the sale process. And while potential ICO investors are wading through white papers and scrutinizing tech teams and advisers to vet token projects, which platforms an ICO launches on is yet another mechanism for understanding what a token project is all about. Several of these platforms provide vetting before partnering with a project for example, while others are more eager to host as many projects as they can. Call it re-intermediation if you like, a reinvention of investment banking for the crypto age, or simply a new business model with no apples-to-apples precedent. Here's a look at some of the companies taking the busywork out of running an ICO. CoinList Launched last May as a collaboration between Protocol Labs and AngelList, a platform for connecting early-stage startups with investors, CoinList aims to be "the gold standard" platform for token offerings. Late last year, CoinList parted with AngelList – whose founder, Naval Ravikant, is an influencer in the blockchain space – became a standalone company, and since then CEO Andy Bromberg has positioned it as a place only for the "best of the best token sales." To do so, the company examines not only ICO project's technical work, but also the token economics underpinning the system. So far, only three projects have issued tokens through its platform, but these have been among some of the most widely-anticipated sales in the industry: Protocol Lab's Filecoin SAFTs, Blockstack's "stacks" and mobile video streaming provider, YouNow's "props." Yet, a great many other ICOs in the space have used another CoinList product – ComplyAPI, a white-label product which handles investor accreditation, know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering compliance for ICOs. Republic Another AngelList spin-off, Republic occupies a unique area of the industry. Launched in July 2016 as a traditional equity crowdfunding platform after the Jobs Act provided ways for non-accredited investors to invest in private companies, Republic recently launched a crypto token platform, using their Token DPA (debt payable by asset) instrument, for the same purpose. For example, in December, Republic offered YouNow's "props" and facilitated the purchase of $1.07 million worth of the token in YouNow's larger token sale. While the company gives access to those enthusiasts that would otherwise be constrained from participating in certain token sales, the platform isn't suited to run a complete ICO (most of the fundraising an ICO does would have to be on another platform). Still, in its infancy, the "props" sale is the only one Republic has facilitated so far, but Republic CEO Kendrick Nguyen told CoinDesk more are soon to come. He continued: "We're highly selective and choose to work primarily with projects that already have significant traction and/or have noted advisors and investors supporting their vision." TokenSoft Co-founded by BitGo alum Mason Borda, TokenSoft focuses on providing assurance to the entrepreneurs launching crypto tokens with a white-label product that runs on client project sites. "Our clients can rest assured that they are adhering to their counsel's guidance by partnering with us," Borda told CoinDesk. The company launched in September and its platform is structured so that it can answer any question a client's legal team might have over the course of a token sale. For example, the platform allows token issuer's counsel to assess the language and approach to verification of terms and conditions. On September 9, the platform facilitated its first token sale for quantified biology platform Doc.ai, followed by the $5.5 million raise for cooperative ownership fund, Swarm Fund. It has four projects running on the platform now. Indiegogo Indiegogo is one of the oldest and best-known crowdfunding sites. Along with Republic, it's one of the few companies on this list with non-crypto origins. The company recently announced they'd be opening up the platform to ICOs, and Indiegogo's previous success and its existing community of people could be attractive for token issuers. According to Slava Rubin, an Indiegogo co-founder: "Token-based fundraising has enormous potential to disrupt the capital markets, but today's landscape lacks a voice of credibility to help separate quality from quantity." While these platforms could seem like easy targets for tweaking business models to accept crypto token sales, Indiegogo's chief rival, Kickstarter, made it clear that it would not be facilitating the sale of crypto tokens. Indiegogo is also proceeding cautiously. The only token project it has so far facilitated is the ICO for the Fan Controlled Football League (FCFL) launched on December 12, which met its $5 million goal in ten days. ICO Engine Swiss company Eidoo, which launched a crypto wallet and exchange last year, announced in November that it would be facilitating ICOs through a platform called ICO Engine. While the platform is still new – with the product's standalone website still not available – ethereum-based decentralized lending platform ETHLend finished its token sale on the platform already through the use of Eidoo's mobile application, and augmented reality startup Ubiatar has made a commitment to use the company's platform for its upcoming sale. Eidoo's marketing of the platform emphasizes the amount of active crypto users it has for its wallet and exchange – the app recently hit 200,000 downloads, arguing that more users are more potential investors. Eidoo also facilitates airdrops of tokens for teams that want to use crypto to promote a product or service. But it doesn't yet have KYC/AML compliance built into the platform, although it can integrate with existing solutions in this area. BlockEx According to BlockEx CEO Adam Leonard: "Our head of capital markets says all the time, 'If I won't sell it to my mom, it ain't going on the platform." BlockEx is a very new platform for ICO issuance, but is making a name for itself by offering token issuers consulting on their white paper and token economics should the team believe the project is working on a good fundamental idea. The platform limits itself to working with issuers of utility tokens – those that give holders access to a particular service. And it insists on strong KYC, plus will require milestones before releasing funds if companies want to raise a lot of money. One of the features Leonard emphasized is its book building software, which helps a token issuer gauge interest from investors and finds a price for their offering. While BlockEx doesn't technically "market" the token sales happening on its platform, the company does offer opportunities by organizing events and road shows where issuers can pitch their token to investors in person. The company is also running its own ICO for a token that will give investors on the platform early access to token presales. Cointopia Launched this week, Cointopia built a platform for connecting ICO issuers to a long pipeline of investors. And with the support (both as advisers and investors) of co-founder of Block.one Brock Pierce, Evercoin founder Miko Matsumura and Stellar founder Jed McCaleb, the company is sure to grab some attention. The first two tokens it will be offering is the Bee token, which will back a decentralized version of Airbnb, and Cointopia's own ICO token. According to Charles Michael Yim, Cointopia's founder, the company's main differentiator is its post-ICO management solution. "Companies have pain points in managing the tokens and funds post ICO, communicating to token holders, monitoring performance and most importantly driving value to the token," Yim said. In an effort to help with that, Cointopia would like to start its own exchange, so that tokens immediately have a secondary market to be traded on. Speaking to the nascency of the industry overall, Gil Penchina, a Cointopia adviser and investor, said in a press release: "As with any new growth industry, the companies selling the ‘picks and shovels’ always win." Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Brock Pierce is with Blockchain Capital. An earlier version of this report inaccurately indicated that the sales were limited to accredited investors.

coindesk	who-needs-a-csd-nivaura-to-issue-first-regulated-bond-in-ethereum	Who Needs a CSD? Nivaura to Issue First Regulated Ether Bond - CoinDesk	2017-11-22T10:00	Blockchain startup Nivaura has today initiated its first bond denominated exclusively in ether. Built under the regulatory oversight of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the first-of-its-kind instrument was issued by London-based luxury retail startup LuxDeco and created with the help of industry leaders to give the company a new way to raise capital for short-term seasonal demand. But what's truly disruptive about the issuance isn't the use of cryptocurrency, rather it's that the bond will be cleared, settled and registered on the public ethereum blockchain. With a relatively short lifecycle of only one week, the bond is also part of a larger experiment to see if removing financial middlemen can make such investment vehicles more accessible to small businesses on a massive scale. "As an entrepreneurial business we are always looking at ways to gain advantage and scale," said the founder and CEO of LuxDeco, Jonathan Holmes, in an interview with CoinDesk. "So, if cryptocurrency becomes a valid funding and trading option we would definitely look at issuing further bonds in the future." And while private blockchains have largely been the purvey of CSDs and other legacy infrastructure providers, the founder and CEO of venture-backed Nivaura, Avtar Sehra, argued that the new bond shows the potential of public blockchains when applied to enterprise business models. Sehra said: "What we're showing is you can use open public infrastructure for regulated financial instruments, and this is a very critical step, because from the earliest stages we've always believed that public blockchains are the way forward." Big name input To ensure the ethereum bond aligned with existing workflows, a number of counterparties were involved in its creation. As part of JPMorgan's in-residence program Nivaura received input for the development of an automated bookbuilding process that could be deployed for a number of different financial instruments. With the help of law firm Allen & Overy Nivaura then used that structure to construct legally compliant documentation that automated the work using ethereum smart contracts. In turn, credit rating firm Moody's priced the instrument by providing data to generate yield curves, factoring the volatility of ethereum into the structure of the bond itself. Specifically, while a control experiment (discussed in greater detail below) paid 2.5 percent annual interest, the ethereum bond is expected to offer annual interest of about 10 percent to help offset the perceived risk of using a cryptocurrency prone to rapid price fluctuations. Ether used to purchase the bond was be deposited to a public address called the Nivaura Client ETH Account. To help conclude the process, investors, in turn, must confirm the account in which they'd like to receive principal and interest when the bond reaches maturity on Nov. 29. While the entire process was designed to be as self-service as possible, a trustee service is also being provided by Australia-based Link Asset Services (previously known as Capita) in case the issuer defaults on the loan. "A blockchain can't do that," said Sehra, elaborating: "A blockchain can't go and enforce a contract and reclaim the assets for the investors. This is essentially where an accountable third party is always required." Bitcoin control Yet, the ethereum bond issued today is just the latest of a two-part experiment designed to show how public blockchains could turn bond issuance into an increasingly self-service industry. Considered a control group for comparison with the ethereum bond, the earlier work was conducted using the bitcoin blockchain, resulting in a more manual process in part due to expected difficulty writing smart contracts. This bond was created last month as part of another regulatory sandbox similarly set up by the FCA to give the partners assurance they won't accidentally violate industry controls. In spite of the difficulty automating some of this earlier work, end users were still afforded a degree of self-service, by using private keys assigned to them via a KYC/AML onboarding process built into the Nivaura platform. The biggest difference between the tests was that instead of depositing the cryptocurrency directly to an account on the blockchain, as with the ethereum bond, British pounds were deposited into Nivaura's Client Money Account. A document given by Nivaura to the counterparties explained the limitations of this arrangement: "This meant that the ownership of money on the blockchain could not be considered as the independent source of truth due to the dependency on, and management of, the funds held in a Client Money Account." Going forward With the lessons learned from both of these live experiments, Nivaura and LuxDeco have plans for a number of further implementations. LuxDeco's Holmes said he first discovered Nivaura in response to global customers who wanted to pay for their goods in ethereum and bitcoin – and if the bond matures without any problems, that's exactly what the firm would like to do next. "If we eventually start accepting payments in cryptocurrency, which we think will come, there is potentially a natural case for funding our working capital cycles through this means too," he said. As for Nivaura, Sehra is mindful of other bond issuers such as Daimler, Fisco and Overstock who have used cryptocurrency for part of their process. As those companies, and others working in derivatives, make their own progress, he expects to see a convergence. Sehra concluded: "We're already seeing derivatives in cryptocurrency. Bonds and derivatives are going to be the next step. They're going to be the next pioneers." Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Nivaura.

coindesk	why-a-39-million-ico-chose-stellar-over-ethereum	Why a $39 Million ICO Chose Stellar Over Ethereum - CoinDesk	2018-01-25T14:00	"We look at ethereum like AOL or Myspace." That's how Mobius Network co-founder and CEO David Gobaud explains why his startup ran its initial coin offering (ICO) on the Stellar network instead of ethereum, the most popular blockchain for token sales. The comment underscores the growing interest in some corners of the crypto community for faster and cheaper payment rails as ethereum, like bitcoin, struggles to scale. Mobius announced Thursday that it has raised $39 million in the ICO — one of the larger recent token sales and the largest by far on the Stellar platform. The company accepted only Stellar's native currency, lumens (XLM), in exchange for its own token, known as mobi. According to Mobius, the sale hit its $39 million hard cap after only two hours, selling 35 percent of the total 888 million mobi tokens. Participants in the round included China's Angel Chain Capital, Nirvana Capital and WaltonChain, an internet of things (IoT) startup that is building devices to enable manufacturers and retailers to track supply chains, according to the firm's website. In addition to this backing, Gobaud emphasized that Mobius deployed its decentralized app (dapp) store alongside its ICO, saying it was important for the company to come out with live code early, to prove the project was real. But what's perhaps most striking about the sale was the choice of blockchain. While latency or cost might not be a dealbreaker for some blockchain projects, they are for Mobius' use case. Its thesis is that traditional tech companies will soon want to integrate with cryptocurrencies and, eventually, a decentralized web. Mobius' white paper compares the company's work to that of Stripe, the Silicon Valley darling that took integration of credit card payments down to a few lines of code (and incubated Stellar in its early days). Mobius aims to do the same thing for cryptocurrency payments and, down the line, for publishing data to trade on decentralized marketplaces. So the company needed an IoT-friendly network that could handle large amounts of transactions and data quickly, with low or no fees. The goal is to "make it easy to connect every device, developer and data stream to the blockchain ecosystem," Gobaud said. Yet while the vast majority of ICO-funded projects have been run on top of ethereum, using the ERC-20 standard, that blockchain has suffered from transaction backlogs and pendulum-like swings in fees. Hence, after beginning its project on ethereum, Mobius switched to Stellar, the protocol created by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb. Like Ripple before it, Stellar was designed specifically for frictionless payments. Trade-offs Ethereum's scaling challenges have become acute in recent months. The issue moved Kik to announce that it would move its kin token off ethereum in December 2017. While the ethereum developers recognize and are working on the problem, the Mobius team couldn't wait for a scaling solution, Gobaud said. "We were building our dapp store on ethereum and then we connected with Jed," he said adding: "We realized there was no way that ethereum could handle our technology. It was too slow, too expensive and too insecure.... We see all these other projects with these immense problems" Gobaud highlighted the problems with safely deploying smart contracts. "They are Turing complete programs, but they are really hard to write," he said, pointing to the first and second multi-million-dollar ether losses on Parity. Solidity was not a language built with security in mind, Gobaud argued. In Stellar, "we think we've uncovered this underutilized, really unknown technology," Gobaud said. For example, Stellar supports multi-signature wallets at the protocol level, making custodianship much easier for developers. But Stellar has its downsides, Gobaud acknowledged. It's not Turing complete, for example, but Mobius is happy to make that trade-off in exchange for vastly faster and cheaper transactions. What's next? The white paper discusses a lot of use cases for the mobi token and its protocol, but the easiest one to explain is payments. For anyone who believes that cryptocurrency will become more and more appealing to online businesses, the company that makes transacting in crypto easy the fastest stands to recoup benefits with a long tail. If Mobius can make accepting crypto payments a matter of adding a few lines of code, that would be compelling if online companies begin accepting cryptocurrency more widely. Talking to Gobaud, though, payments seems more like a way to sell the traditional internet on blockchain integration. He's most excited about the market that will come when firms start posting their data to decentralized marketplaces, selling it via secure, live auctions he calls the "NASDAQ for data." Gobaud said: "More advanced or technical users are really excited about the data marketplace because they are aware that getting data into blockchain ecosystem is really complicated." Data generated on blockchain protocols is easy to verify because they are closed environments. But data from the real world can't be verified on a blockchain without help. That's why Mobius is building a proof-of-stake oracle system, so that data streams with data from the real world can build up reputations as reliable sources over time. With the system, to put its data up for sale on the market, a company would have to prove it holds a certain amount of tokens. If that marketplace catches on, the cost of staking should be more than paid for by revenue from selling data over time. This could be anything from data about road conditions from a smart vehicle or local weather from a sensor on top of a commercial building. To reach the point where the decentralized web has a rich enough ecosystem to support these marketplaces, the team is also working to solve other small problems faced by developers on the way there. For example, it built a universal login protocol, where a website can verify that a device holds a token to let its user log on to a service. Some sites might want to take this a step further and use tokens to integrate the level of access someone has to a site. So, on a platform like Reddit, a user might only need one token, while a moderator might need a few tokens to log in with more advanced permissions. In the meantime, developers are already building dapps for Mobius' store, but it's small scale offerings so far, little video games or prediction games. That's work at the experimental level, but Gobaud said he's encouraged by the fact that people already want to work with it. The websites on Geocities were crude, too, but they were a stepping stone to the web we know today. He concluded: "It's like the early days of the internet."

coindesk	words-real-companies-talk-ripple-xrp-pilots	In Their Own Words: Real Companies Talk Ripple XRP Pilots - CoinDesk	2018-01-29T13:00	Just one – before this month, that's how many financial firms had publicly expressed interest in using Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP. Indeed, the blockchain startup has no lack of partners, from American Express to SEB, that use its xCurrent product, which allows financial institutions to send transactions in real-time without the innovative new crypto-asset. But it was only a little-known company (Mexico-based Cuallix) that had signed on to use Ripple's xRapid to leverage XRP for liquidity. Flash forward to today, however, and the narrative has seen a shift. In rapid-fire succession, three money transfer firms revealed they are piloting the use of XRP. First was remittance giant MoneyGram, then came Mercury FX (which conducts about $500 million in transaction volume per year) and finally telecom provider IDT. To many, the news has been a vindication – not just for Ripple, but for the millions of mainstream investors that have embraced XRP as an alternative investment, helping it rise from mere cents early last year to nearly $4 this month. And while it's still an open question as to whether such tests will go live, during the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse framed the general skepticism as old-fashioned and out of touch. Garlinghouse told attendees: "When I hear banks say, 'We’re not going to use digital assets,' I hear Randal Stevens say 'AT&T will never use IP.'" Internal only So far, the largest interested party in XRP is legacy money transmitter MoneyGram, which in addition to being valued at $700 million, has over 350,000 locations around the world at which customers can pick up cash. However, the pilot does not directly serve any of those locations, according to a spokeswoman. Instead, the pilot is focused on implementing XRP within Moneygram's internal corporate treasury transactions. In an email, she described an internal pilot for back-office functionality only. "MoneyGram is not using XRP in customer transactions," the spokeswoman told CoinDesk. That might seem a bit strange, since a whopping 89 percent of Moneygram's revenue in 2016 was generated from its money transfer service, according to the company's most recent annual report, and XRP (and other cryptocurrencies) are widely targeted at cross-border money movement. But while those potential XRP use cases aren't being tested yet within MoneyGram, Holmes said what the company learns from the internal pilot could someday inform much broader applications. The spokeswoman said: "The goal is to investigate whether it is efficient in terms of time and cost and to see if it can be a viable addition to our FX trading." Consumer-facing Perhaps more notably, London-based Mercury FX's interest in XRP is geared towards consumer-facing applications. "I imagine we will be able to begin using XRP for customer payments in the coming months," the founder and director of Mercury FX, Alastair Constance, told CoinDesk. He continued, saying, "As with all things, we will start with more modest sums in the thousands of dollars and increase by orders of magnitude from there. Come to the end of the pilot we will not be surprised if XRP is carrying single transactions across the blockchain of a million dollars or more." By far the most detailed pilot, the Mercury FX project will use xRapid to conduct payments for goods and services in China and Mexico, with the hope that it will expand to other emerging markets via partnerships with Ripple and other platforms. While the software for the pilot is currently being integrated with Mercury FX, Constance said the pilot won't likely formally begin for two more months, before concluding about three months after that. Not all of Mercury FX's nearly $500 million in annual transaction volume will be conducted with XRP anytime soon, though, as Constance said he's also exploring using some of Ripple's other blockchain products that don't require XRP. "Crypto is building into crypto from one side and fiat needs to build from the other side," he said. "Ripple lets fiat companies like us do that." Use unknown While XRP dropped from its nearly $4 highs, it's held relatively stable between $1 and $1.50. Yet, it'll be interesting to see how news of new pilots and interest affect the price of the cryptocurrency, especially if new details about Cuallix's work and IDT's pilot are revealed. IDT declined to comment for this report, other than to point to its existing statements, where Alfredo O'Hagan, SVP of IDT's consumer payments business said, "We're excited to pilot Ripple's xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost." Cuallix did not respond to inquiries before press time. Of note also though, is another, newer use case for XRP – as venture capital. Last week, online marketplace Omni revealed it had accepted a venture investment largely in XRP, which it plans to use in part to pay the bills — such as paying freelancers. With all these new projects implementing XRP into the plan, no one is possibly more relieved than Ripple executives themselves, who had known of the interest, but had largely been unable to share it with the public. Ripple's head of product, Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk: "We're pleased to be able to share how payment providers are implementing xRapid to improve their payments flows. Remember, we just built and launched xRapid late last summer. This is just the beginning." Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

coindesk	world-without-brokers-insurance-consortium-reveals-codex-1-blockchain	Brokers Beware: Insurance Consortium Reveals Codex 1 Blockchain Prototype - CoinDesk	2017-08-29T12:00	Blockchain insurance consortium B3i has revealed new details about its blockchain smart contract prototype, including advancements that could eventually remove much of the administrative work done by all counterparties. In conversation with CoinDesk, director of global business solutions at reinsurance company Swiss Re, Paul Meeusen outlined how the platform could reduce the role of brokers, for example who seem particularly susceptible. Internally described as "Codex 1," the prototype is designed to automate many of the processes involved in catastrophe reinsurance currently fulfilled by brokers, and eventually to improve the trading of risk more broadly. In part, the prototype does this by giving the insurance companies seeking reinsurance, brokers and the reinsurance companies that serve them, access to the same, cryptographically secure distributed ledger. While all the counterparties involved in the reinsurance workflow today remain intact in Codex 1, the prototype shows how insurance brokers could become the latest group to have some of its services rendered irrelevant. Meeusen, who is also a founding member of B3i, said he sees substantial impact if the blockchain prototype were to be adopted on a large scale. He said: "The administrative involvement where part of what [brokers] do is collecting the papers from the different parties, then ordering them and passing them onto the next, that is of course becoming unnecessary." Depending how you look at it, automating the administrative tasks could pose a threat to all counterparty services, but Meeusen explained that B3i would rather look at it as a way to allow the counterparties to focus on value-added advisory products. Work on Codex 1 began earlier this year as members of the consortium – which includes Aegon, Allianz, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Liberty Mutual and Sompo Japan Nipponkoa – evaluated several potential use cases for blockchain. The group finally decided to convert the Property Cat XL ("Cat" being short for "catastrophe") reinsurance work flow to a self-executing smart contract, specifically because its similarities around the world make it potentially widely adoptable. "If you look at catastrophic risk, when the wind blows or the earth shakes, in simple terms, I would say the nature of that is very uniform across the globe," he said. Passing on the savings Since the early days of the consortium, Meeusen has advocated that blockchain technology could enable reinsurance companies to compete over better products, instead of just better platforms. For example, in a typical Property Cat XL contract, a broker would receive quotes from multiple reinsurers and help organize which combination of risk assessment and pricing is most advantageous. They would then facilitate communication between each of the counterparties while keeping private the terms of the eventual deal. With Codex 1, however, much of the broker's role is moved to a permissioned blockchain that automates both premium settlement and claim settlement, all while still ensuring the counterparties remain unaware of one another's terms. The end result, Meeusen hopes, is that companies can focus their attention on creating more accurate risk assessments and better rates. "We would expect that – just like reinsurers – when they become more efficient, over time they can offer more attractive prices," he said. And according to Meeusen, if brokers don't get removed from the equation, he expects they will be able to "offer more attractive brokerage fees because their service is going to become much more efficient." Broadening the use cases While this first prototype is focused on property catastrophes, according to Meeusen, the group is ready to begin work on multiple other projects currently "on the shelf." The next step will be to widen the scope of the offering to include casualty lines (such as motor vehicle accidents and worker's compensation), which Meeusen said will require little more than a "copy-paste" of the current smart contract. B3i also aims to expand its blockchain work to include so-called "proportional contracts" that rely on pro-rated terms, as well as improving the actual creation of insurance-linked securities and bonds. If successful, the prototype – scheduled for its first live demo at the Monte Carlo RVS conference in September – could eventually result in tokenized bonds, making trading risk as easy as trading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. Meeusen concluded: "That's the master plan. But we first need to walk before we run."

coindesk	xbrl-reporting-standard-co-founder-joins-blockchain-startup	XBRL Reporting Standard Co-Founder Joins Blockchain Startup - CoinDesk	2017-11-28T16:00	Blockchain startup Auditchain has added the co-founder of a widely used business reporting standard to its leadership team. The new hire, Eric Cohen, will serve as head of XBRL architecture for the New York-based firm, as announced today at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event. Auditchain is developing an accounting ecosystem centered around blockchain-based tokens, and utilizing one of its own (called AUDT) that will serve as a means to access and pay for services. Cohen is perhaps best known as the co-founder of XBRL, a reporting standard required by business regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and similar agencies in Europe and abroad. He also spent more than 17 years working for professional services firm PwC. Auditchain co-founder Jason Meyers told CoinDesk that Cohen's involvement traces back to an event at Rutgers University that focused on continuous auditing. "I was ecstatic when I met him, and for him to join us totally vindicates what we're doing," he said. In an email to CoinDesk, Cohen framed his work with blockchain as part of a broader, decades-long focus on auditing technology. "Leveraging [blockchain]/DLT technologies to provide a fantastic new foundation, enabled by layers of abstraction, can enable new payment channels, and securely hook in resources of all sorts," he wrote, adding: "It's really not new theory; it goes back to the 60s, just fleshing out the tools that makes it practical. " That Cohen would link up with Auditchain is perhaps unsurprising, given his stated interest in blockchain technology and related commentary on platforms like Twitter. According to his personal website, Cohen has also played a role in the development of standards around blockchain, including an ongoing effort spearheaded by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

coindesk	xrp-dichotomy-ripple-price	Could XRP's Frenzied Rise Herald Future Growth? - CoinDesk	2018-01-06T20:15	Chris Brookins is the founder of Pugilist Ventures, a blockchain and fintech focused VC firm. The author invests in cryptocurrencies and has a position in XRP. It's no secret the crypto space is in a speculative "frothy" frenzy currently. Under these circumstances, fundamental analysis becomes less important. Speculators are trading on emotion and greed, not fundamentals. Such is arguably the case with XRP, the native token that powers Ripple's RippleNet ledger. Over the last month, it has blown up by almost 1,400 percent, and it's showing no signs of slowing. Amidst this short-term frenzy, however, there is also opportunity for long-term analysis. When we made a trading recommendation on XRP to our investor network last month, we stated that despite XRP’s long-term hurdles, its price action and technical analysis charts were setting up nicely for a price spike. At that time, XRP was trading between $0.25 — $0.30. We did not forecast a specific price target given we don’t own a crystal ball, but we did see an interesting dichotomy forming. We thought Ripple had great company fundamentals and that XRP’s speculative investment potential was ripe for high risk and high reward. Short-term analysis Looking ahead, Pugilist Ventures maintains both its speculative fundamental evaluation and its positive short-term trading view for XRP; simultaneously. While Ripple may be overbought, that doesn't mean the market won't keep buying. In short, if XRP maintains its exponential growth during 2018, then its long-term fundamentals may change for the positive according to the Theory of Reflexivity a la George Soros. The fundamentals in the case of XRP are basically its long-term probability of becoming a quasi-reserve currency (QRC) for financial institutions. (We say "quasi" because we do not believe central banks will ever fully relinquish their local currencies without a fight.) The path to QRC status will need to include demonstrable growth within the following areas: Liquidity and market makers Institutional derivatives that would allow banks to hedge foreign exchange exposure on their balance sheet On-boarding financial institutions onto its xCurrent and xRapid products in both exotic and non-exotic corridors. Reflexivity for XRP By simple definition, Reflexivity is a three-part process whereby an asset’s price increase drives investor expectations higher which positively changes the asset’s fundamentals, resulting in further price appreciation. Rinse and repeat. Reflexive price appreciation may substantially increase demand and mainstream adoption for XRP. For example, imagine if XRP supersedes bitcoin’s (BTC) market cap in 2018. This speculative demand spike would dramatically increase liquidity and potential derivatives coverage, which would help Ripple onboard more banks (fewer objections to adoption) onto xCurrent + xRapid, thus improving XRP’s fundamentals, i.e. the path to QRC status. XRP is being driven primarily by speculation in our opinion. However, this speculation may actually increase the long-term probability of success for XRP by increasing market liquidity, derivatives coverage and mainstream adoption as medium of exchange and store of value; while planting the seeds of a future QRC debate. All of which provide fuel to Ripple’s most important business goal of growing financial institutions using both xCurrent and xRapid for global payments. Only time shall tell if this path bears fruit for Ripple and XRP. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

coindesk	xrp-fever-crypto-assets-outpacing-2018-gains	Ripple Fever? Other Crypto Assets Are Outpacing Its 2018 Gains - CoinDesk	2018-01-04T18:25	So-called alternative cryptocurrencies are making their presence felt in the first week of 2018, recording impressive gains that are drawing investors to options once considered risky. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rallied 1,900 percent last year. But, as prices neared the $20,000 mark in December, the relatively cheap "small cap" coins began to rise. With gains due, in part at least, to the rotation of money out of an overbought bitcoin, the broader cryptocurrency rally seems to have gathered pace in 2018. With 66 percent appreciation so far in 2018, Ripple's XRP token is now the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. That's impressive, yet XRP still ranks sixth on the list of top gainers so far this year, among those ranked in the top 25 by total value, as of 18:00 UTC. So which "large-cap" cryptocurrencies are leading the pack? Top 10 cryptocurrencies of 2018 by percentage gained Overall, the TRON token tops the table with 270 percent gains since Jan. 1. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 100 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, and its market cap has tripled this week to $10 billion. In second place is the status network token (SNT) – an ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has gained more than 160 percent in value this year and is up 700 percent month-on-month. Stellar, which topped the list two days ago, has slipped to number three. It is now the seventh largest currency with a market cap of $9.97 billion. And although at a record high of over $1,000 today, ethereum's native token ether (up 28 percent this year) sits at the bottom of the table in 10th place. Interestingly, bitcoin ranks as low as 18 (up 2 percent this year), as prices have traded roughly sideways since the fall from its December all-time high.
