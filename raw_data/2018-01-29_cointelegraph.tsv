cointelegraph	530-million-in-xem-stolen-from-coincheck-can-be-traced-nem-team-confirms	$530 Mln in XEM Stolen From Coincheck Can Be Traced, N...	2018-01-27	 This week, $534 mln worth of XEM, the native cryptocurrency of NEM, was stolen from a major Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck. On January 27, merely hours after the hacking attack was announced, developers behind NEM created an automated tagging system to track down the funds stolen by hackers. Stolen funds will be traced As Cointelegraph reported on January 26, $534 million worth of XEM were stolen from low security hot wallet that lacked multi-signature security measures. During a press conference covered by Cointelegraph, Coincheck executives stated that all of the funds were stored in a hot wallet or an online wallet, which left user funds vulnerable to the security breach. Shortly after the press conference, NEM representatives and its open-source development community firmly opposed the idea of conducting a hard fork to prevent user funds on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange from being recovered. A hard fork could have been executed if $534 million in NEM were stolen due to the fault of the NEM blockchain. But, because the security breach was caused by the lack of strong security measures of Coincheck, the NEM development team rightfully refused to conduct a hard fork. Instead, the NEM development team created an automated tagging system to ensure that all funds stolen from Coincheck are traced. By tagging stolen funds as tainted funds, cryptocurrency exchanges can now easily verify if stolen NEM funds are withdrawn or deposited to regulated trading platforms. “Hack update: NEM is creating an automated tagging system that will be ready in 24-48 hours. This automated system will follow the money and tag any account that receives tainted money. NEM has already shown exchanges how to check if an account has been tagged. So the good news is that the money that was hacked via exchanges can't leave,” said a NEM spokesperson. During an interview, NEM Foundation vice president Jeff McDonald confirmed the development of the tagging system and the work NEM Foundation will lead in the next few weeks to prevent stolen funds from being cashed out or converted to other cryptocurrencies through trading platforms. As of now, the hackers behind the Coincheck NEM security breach are out of options. It is not possible for the hackers to convert the stolen NEM to other major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum because the automated tagging system will immediately alert exchanges about the tainted funds. Due to the sheer size of the stolen funds, it is also not likely that the hackers will go through small-scale cryptocurrency exchanges to convert or launder the stolen funds. At this stage, the only safe option for the hackers is to hold onto the stolen NEM. Because of the technology NEM has developed in light of the recent Coincheck hack, it has become significantly difficult for the hackers to do anything with the funds. It is not possible to cash out the stolen NEM to fiat currencies like the US dollar and it is also not possible to convert the stolen funds to other cryptocurrencies. Important favor NEM, its open-source development community, and the NEM Foundation did not have to develop the tagging system for the benefit of Coincheck, specifically because stolen funds on the NEM blockchain network would still have circulated around the network even if they are not recovered. But, NEM developers have done Coincheck and investors that lost millions of dollars in the hacking attack a tremendous favor by voluntarily creating a solution to a serious problem.
cointelegraph	a-new-decentralized-platform-helps-investors-enter-the-over-the-counter-ecosystem	A New Decentralized Platform Helps Investors Enter the...	2018-01-23	 Despite its growth in the level of awareness, how to enter the crypto ecosystem still remains a mystery to a lot of interested participants. Most people do not understand how to or where to find entry into a market that is filled with so many opportunities. To this end, OnPlace, Russian-US-based company, is creating a decentralized investor community for customers to join, allowing for closed Over-the-counter (OCT) assets to be introduced to the market turnover and to create liquidity for them as well. The platform will create opportunities for investing into funds of the fastest growing tech companies around the world with low entry thresholds for the average person to access. The nature of the crypto marketplace at the moment consists of independent assets scattered over numerous exchanges and platforms. For investors who are new in the industry, this arrangement can be quite disorientating. Having to jump between platforms in order to achieve ownership of tokens and crypto assets entails a cumbersome and sometimes discouraging situation. Therefore, having all processes harmonized on a particular platform that gives investors all the necessary options at a glance is indeed a welcome industrial development. Unified investment platform The OnPlace Private Assets Tokenization System (PATS) protocol is designed to tokenize over-the-counter (OTC) assets for customers to invest into. The protocol entails multiple steps firstly establishing a marketplace opportunity window (MOW), following the MOW there is a selection of projects to be tokenized based on the criteria and communal discussions of crypto-investors. This system will allow the community of investors to make decisions in a decentralized manner in regards to the further distribution and motion of tokenized assets. The use of the protocol will mean that each decision in connection to transactions over tokens will be recorded in a network with its own Blockchain and will not be subject to change. Letting investors have control Every underlying asset implemented using PATS protocol will be represented by a separate private token and endowed logic of decentralized management of PATS protocol. This approach is based on the idea of creating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, in which each holder of a token can directly affect the asset and determine further operations over tokens via voting. Thus, each decision in regards to operating over tokens will be registered in a network and will not be subject to change. Together with the managing and monitoring functions, PATS protocol provides autonomous safety of investors’ balances from losing funds during the emission and closing of shares. This setup by OnPlace is expected to solve one of the persistent problems that have hindered the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. The solution that this project brings will allow investors to determine the closing date of an asset, add new assets for examination inside the community, vote for the emission of tokens of underlying assets or change the parameters of circulating tokens and produce equivalent trade of tokens of the PATS protocol directly, without using third-party stock exchanges. This system enables the attributes of Blockchain technology by allowing investors significant control over the handling of assets that they trade. Crowdfunding and token sale Following its creation in 2016 OnPlace now has existing corporate existence in Moscow and the US, with a self-funded bank account of $200,000. Having established a team that developed an alpha version of their Ethereum Blockchain Contracts, launching a closed alpha for early investors, the company has attracted over $1 mln with their first wave of investors from a crowdfunding platform. OnPlace is prepared to launch a TGE (Pre-Sale) in February 2018, providing customers with an easy way to invest into a number of companies from IT-related industries using business standards and cryptocurrency expertise.

cointelegraph	arizona-state-university-partners-with-dash-to-fund-research-scholarships	Arizona State University Partners With Dash to Fund Re...	2018-01-19	 Arizona State University (ASU) has announced a partnership with the digital currency Dash that will provide $350,000 to “accelerate research, development, and education in ways that advance blockchain transaction speed, efficiency, security, and expand its uses.” The funds will be allocated as follows: The Dash Scholars Program, which provides $100,000 in scholarships for undergraduate and graduate research fellowships; Research lab and Industry open source projects, providing an additional $100,000 in funding for ASU’s Blockchain Research Lab (BRL) and $50,000 in new funding for the Luminosity Lab, and Blockchain course development, with $100,000 for creating an online graduate course expected to be offered at ASU this fall. The $350,000 is funded by Dash, via a successful treasury proposal. Director of ASU’s Blockchain Research Lab, Dragan Boscovic, commented: “ASU welcomes this initiative and is ready to play its role in creating a potent Blockchain research and innovation environment for young talents to develop practical Blockchain applications.” Fusion of research and development When thinking about digital currencies, there’s a tendency for the community to focus on the development side of the equation. New versions of the software, updates to add new features, roadmaps and the like - these usually get far more attention than research. However, the new features that get everybody so excited are made possible by researchers who discover the means and methods to add them. While Dash’s Core DAO (distributed autonomous organization) is focused on development, marketing and the day-to-day aspects of maintaining a digital currency, there are at least two research groups working to move the project forward. Dash Labs is a DAO founded by Dash founder Evan Duffield, based in Hong Kong, that is working to develop hardware solutions to enable on-chain scaling using massive blocks. Likewise, researchers at ASU are working on researching ways to improve Dash and solve the problems of cryptocurrency in general. Last summer, Dash funded ASU’s Blockchain Research Lab with a $50,000 donation. Dash Core Team CEO Ryan Taylor wrote : “Initial research [will] focus on throughput capacity and latency performance of blockchain technology, model and assess it for different network architectures (including Dash's multi-tiered architecture), applications, and use cases to propose a "scalability" deployment guide and best practices.” Taylor notes that the partnership is exclusive: “Until now, the majority of Blockchain research has been focused on Bitcoin, with minimal focus on other Blockchain applications…The sponsorship incorporate[s] Dash as the exclusive digital currency for ongoing academic research.” Bitcoin and MIT Dash isn’t the only digital currency project to partner with a major university. In the summer of 2015, MIT launched the Digital Currency Initiative and solicited donations which were used to hire three full-time Bitcoin developers. This move followed the effective collapse of the Bitcoin Foundation, which had been providing much of the funding for development. None of the funds actually come from MIT, rather, they come from outside donors and are funneled through the Digital Currency Initiative. By May 2016, MIT had raised $900,000 to fund these developers’ salaries. Later that year, this number had risen to $2 million. This funding is crucial, as Nasdaq points out : “Funding Bitcoin development seems to have always been problematic.” While some developers are willing and able to work full-time on open source projects like Bitcoin without compensation, most are not. Therefore, funding is desperately needed to maintain and advance the project. A different method of funding While MIT has serious fundraising muscle, dependence on the altruism of others is always a shaky proposition. While most digital currency projects rely on donations or an initial endowment (via ICO) to fund development, Dash has chosen a different method. Dash self-funds its development team, paying developer salaries out of a portion of the block rewards. Each month, 10% of the block rewards are reserved for successful treasury proposals. This means that as much as 6,650 DASH, worth $5.8 mln at press time, can be paid out directly by the network to those who manage to get their treasury proposals passed. Dash’s treasury system pays for marketing efforts, business development and integrations, conference sponsorships and more. Most important, Dash’s treasury pays Dash Core developers’ salary each month. At present, Dash employs a staff of 50, including 23 developers, four project managers, eight marketing specialists and 15 other administrative employees. These team members are paid a total of $300,000 per month, directly from Dash’s treasury system. No donations are necessary, and nobody is required to work for free. It’s this treasury system that funded the $350,000 partnership with ASU. Direction of influence One of Dash’s community members who goes by the handle of “TanteStefana,” wrote that while MIT funds Bitcoin’s development, Dash funds ASU’s research lab. She points out that the direction of influence is completely different: Bitcoin is at least partially dependent on the good will and fundraising efforts of MIT. This means the university could theoretically attempt to influence the project. With the partnership between Dash and ASU, money and influence flows in the opposite direction. It’s Dash that’s providing funding to ASU, making it impossible for the university to wield any influence over the project. Good fit Cointelegraph had the opportunity to speak with Dragan Boscovic, director of ASU’s Blockchain Research Lab, who commented on why Dash is such a good fit for the university: “First, the Dash Core team’s offices are at ASU’s SkySong Innovation Center in Scottsdale, which is also where the Blockchain Research is located, enabling an excellent level of interaction between Dash, ASU faculty and students in a variety of disciplines, including computer science, engineering, business and law. Second, ASU is focused on “building problem solvers and entrepreneurs,” with a large Research and Development budget. Dash is one of the most innovative digital currency solutions with breakthrough algorithms, network topology and services. It’s a natural partnership. Third, there’s been quite a demand for an online graduate course focused on Blockchain technology enablers and applications. The course will help ensure that Blockchain finds an accelerated path toward rapid, mainstream adoption.” When asked what set Dash apart from other digital currency projects, Boscovic replied: “After partnering with Dash this summer and evaluating the possibilities of expanded collaboration, scholarships, Blockchain specialization courses and an accelerated research and innovation effort were identified as ways to move Blockchain applications forward. This speaks volumes about Dash network governance and their capability to self-fund strategic initiatives such as this one.”
cointelegraph	bitcoin-ethereum-bitcoin-cash-ripple-iota-litecoin-nem-cardano-price-analysis-jan-25	Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoi...	2018-01-25	 The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The massive upwards movement in cryptocurrencies over 2017 has not gone unnoticed. The participants at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos are being questioned about cryptocurrencies and Cointelegraph has been one of the main voices representing the fraternity. The traditional investors are still not willing to accept the rising clout of the cryptocurrencies and are pushing for tighter regulation. Only recently, Nordea Bank banned its employees from owning Bitcoin by Feb. 28. However, this move is facing strong opposition from the large unions. Even the fears of a cryptocurrency ban by South Korea gathered a massive petition opposing the move. Finally, the Korean government only banned the traders from using anonymous bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading. The classical investors and regulators fail to understand that these kinds of bans are unlikely to dent the popularity of the cryptocurrencies. BTC/USD Bitcoin is currently in no man’s land. It is facing resistance at the down trendline one. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of this resistance, we can expect a rally towards the down trendline two. Aggressive traders can trade this pullback. Others should wait for a confirmation of a bottom formation because, if the bulls fail to sustain above the down trendline one, the likelihood of $10,000 levels breakdown increases. Unlike the previous falls, this time, the BTC/USD pair is struggling to hold on to higher levels. With the price quoting below both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA, the trend remains down to range bound. The downtrend will reassert itself if the price breaks down to $10,000 levels. So, the swing traders should wait and watch for the next few days for the trend to change from down to up before initiating any long positions. ETH/USD Ethereum is in a pullback in an uptrend because it is still quoting above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. Additionally, it has successfully held on to the uptrend line, which is another positive sign. But the 20-day EMA has flattened out, which points to a range bound trading action for the next few days. The support of the range is likely to be at $900 levels, whereas, the resistance will be at $1,160 levels. The ETH/USD pair will become negative only after it breaks down of the trendline and the 50-day SMA, which is at $845. Long positions for the medium-term can be initiated on dips to $1,000 levels, with a stop loss at $840. We believe that if the 50-day SMA holds, the cryptocurrency will attempt to resume its uptrend and rally to the highs. This is a risky trade, hence, please keep the position size small. BCH/USD The traders, both the bulls and the bears, are not taking any keen interest in Bitcoin Cash. As a result, it has been trading in a small range since Jan. 23. Support on the downside exists at the Jan. 17 low, $1,364.9657. On the upside, as the moving averages have completed bearish crossover, the 20-day EMA is likely to act as a resistance. Additionally, the $2,072 levels and the downtrend line will also act as a strong overhead resistance. We don’t find any tradable setup on the BCH/USD pair. XRP/USD Ripple has formed a doji candlestick pattern on both Jan. 23 and Jan. 24. Even the price action currently points to a very small range day. As forecast in our previous analysis, the XRP/USD pair is likely to remain range bound between $0.87 and $1.74. A trading opportunity will pop up only if the supports of the range hold or if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the overhead resistance. We should wait until then. IOTA/USD IOTA ’s range has been shrinking for the past two days. It has formed successive inside day candlestick patterns on Jan. 23 and Jan. 24. Today, it is trying to resume the downtrend. On the downside, support exists at $1.9232 levels. If this breaks, the IOTA/USD pair can extend its losses to the Dec. 22 low of $1.1. The first signs of a recovery will be seen once the price breaks out of $3.032 and the down trendline of the descending triangle. If the support and the overhead resistance levels hold, we may see a few days of range bound action. LTC/USD Litecoin has held on to the critical support level of $175.199. However, the bounce doesn’t have any strength, which shows a lack of interest in buyers. If the bears succeed in breaking down the supports, a fall to $140.001 is likely. On the other hand, the first signs of a recovery will be on a breakout above $215 levels. Aggressive traders can buy the LTC/USD pair at $187, which is just above the high of past couple of days. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $163 and the target objective is $215. However, this is a very risky trade, hence, please place it only with less than 50 percent of the usual allocation. XEM/USD NEM has held on to the 0.86 levels for the past few days, but the bulls are unable to push prices above the down trendline. This is likely to lead to another attempt to break down of $0.86 within a couple of days. If the bears succeed, a fall to the Jan. 16 lows of $0.55134 is likely. The 20-day EMA has turned down and is likely to complete a bearish crossover if the support breaks. We don’t find any bullish setups on the XEM/USD pair with price trading below the trendline and both the moving averages. A change in trend will be signaled once it rallies above $1.21. ADA/BTC Cardano is again attempting to break out of the 0.00006 levels. If successful, it is likely to rally to the overhead resistance at 0.00006915. A very short-term trader can buy at 0.00006 with a stop loss of 0.00005. This is a risky trade, hence, please attempt it with less than 50 percent of the usual position size. Swing traders should wait for a breakout of the 0.00006915 levels to initiate any long positions. We believe that unless the sentiment turns bullish for the cryptocurrencies, the ADA/BTC pair will find it difficult to breakout of the overhead resistance and may drift down to 0.000047 to 0.000049 levels again, which can be a good level to initiate long positions.

cointelegraph	bitcoin-ethereum-bitcoin-cash-ripple-stellar-litecoin-nem-cardano-price-analysis-jan-27	Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Lite...	2018-01-27	 The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After the discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world leaders are getting ready to deliberate on cryptocurrencies in the forthcoming G20 summit in March. Many leaders seek to regulate cryptocurrencies, but if we study the consequences of the Chinese regulations, we find that they have been ineffective. Traders based in China have started trading at cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has only increased the risk for their traders because now they are forced to buy Bitcoin at a premium of about $1,200 compared to other exchanges. The leaders and central banks, instead of blindly opposing cryptocurrencies should chalk out a strategy to embrace them after discussing with the crypto stalwarts. BTC/USD The Bitcoin bulls have been defending the $10,000 mark for the past few days. But they have not been able to push prices higher, which is a point of concern. The cryptocurrency has broken out of the down trendline one, which shows that the momentum on the downside has decreased. We can expect a few more days of range bound action between $10,000 and $12,000. It is difficult to predict whether the upside or the downside move comes next. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the 20-day EMA, which is currently at $12,218, the BTC/USD pair should rally to the down trendline two. The traders can wait for the breakout above $12,200 to sustain for about 4-hours and then buy with a stop-loss at $9,900. The target objective is a move to $14,500. On the downside, if the bears break below $9,900, the selling is likely to intensify. The next stop on the downside is $8,000. As we are uncertain about the next move, we have elucidated both possibilities. We don’t find any setups as long as the price remains within the range. ETH/USD In our previous analysis, we had recommended long positions in Ethereum on dips to $1,000. Our long positions were triggered yesterday, Jan. 27. After touching an intraday high of $1,102.4 on Jan. 25, the cryptocurrency fell to the down trendline yesterday, Jan. 26. Now, if it manages to break out of $1,110, we can expect it to rally to $1,174.36 levels. Once the ETH/USD pair breaks out of $1,110, traders should raise the stop loss from the current levels of $840 to $950. That will decrease our risk. Partial profits can be booked at $1,170 levels, and the stops on the remaining positions should be trailed higher. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has a history of entering into small range trading days, before a significant breakout or a breakdown. We had seen a similar pattern in August and October last year, 2017. Currently, the price has been stuck in a tight range of $1,479 on the downside and $1,700 on the upside. Any breakout of this range is likely to face a slew of resistance at the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line and $2,072.6853. On the downside, support is at the January 17th low of $1364.9657 and $1141. We don’t find any tradable setup on the BCH/USD pair. XRP/USD Ripple continues to trade inside the range of $0.87 and $1.74 with a downward bias. If the cryptocurrency breaks down of $1.09 levels, a fall to the lower end of the range is likely. The XRP/USD pair is struggling to find any buyers. Therefore, we should wait for the cryptocurrency to bounce off the $0.87 lows before initiating any long positions. The probable bearish crossover of the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA is another negative sign. We anticipate the range-bound trading action to continue for the next few days. XLM/USD Stellar is comparatively stronger cryptocurrency because it is quoting above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA and both are trending higher, whereas, most other top currencies are witnessing a bearish crossover of the moving averages. If the overall sentiment remains subdued, we believe that the XLM/USD pair will face resistance at the $0.671 mark. Currently, we don’t have a suitable stop loss, so, we’d better wait for a correction to the trendline before initiating any long positions. Once the cryptocurrency breaks out of the $0.671 mark, a move towards the highs is likely, with a small resistance at $0.732 levels. It might be a good idea to wait for a low-risk trading opportunity to initiate fresh positions. LTC/USD Litecoin broke below the $175 support level yesterday, Jan. 26, but recovered and closed above it by the end of the day. What might be worth considering is the fact that the bulls are not able to push prices higher. If we don’t get an upside massive range move within a couple of days, chances are that the bears will again attempt to sink the cryptocurrency. On the downside, support exists at $140.001, which is the intraday low of Jan. 17. If this level also breaks, the LTC/USD pair can sink to the next support level of $85. If the bulls manage to push prices higher, they will face resistance at $200 from the 20-day EMA and at the down trendline of the descending triangle. We should change our bearish view only after price breaks out of $225. XEM/USD NEM broke below the $0.86 levels yesterday, Jan. 26, and made an intraday low of $0.775. However, the bears were not able to capitalize on the breakdown. Today, we find some buying at the lower levels. The bulls are attempting to break out of the down trendline, which continues to be major resistance. Even if the price breaks out of this, we expect the XEM/USD pair to face resistance at the $1 levels from both the moving averages. The cryptocurrency will become bullish once it breaks out of $1.21 levels. We shall wait for it to turn positive before recommending any long positions. ADA/BTC Cardano again failed to break out of 0.00006. That’s why the buy suggested in the previous analysis did not trigger. The ADA/BTC pair is now likely to fall to the 0.00005 levels, which should act as a support. However, if this level breaks, a fall to 0.00004730 and after that to 0.00004070 can’t be ruled out. We shall wait for the cryptocurrency to turn bullish before recommending any fresh positions. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.
cointelegraph	bitcoin-laundering-less-than-one-percent-of-all-transactions	Bitcoin Laundering Less Than One Percent of All Transa...	2018-01-21	 A recent report from the joint Bitcoin analysis team of FDD and Ellicit, a Bitcoin forensics company, indicates that less than one percent of all Bitcoin transactions involve money laundering. The report, written to help analyze the flow of funds and the danger of money laundering, has indicated that money laundering isn’t nearly the problem some critics of cryptocurrency believe. The report states: “The amount of observed Bitcoin laundering [is] small and darknet marketplaces such as Silk Road and, later, AlphaBay are [generally] the source of almost all of the illicit Bitcoins laundered through conversion services.” The report also indicates that the vast majority of illicit transactions using Bitcoin were processed in Europe, receiving more than five times as many illicit transactions as North America. AML processes must improve The report suggests that the best way to combat such illicit activity is through more stringent anti-money laundering (AML) measures. The report states that the only way to manage the illicit transaction is for “Financial authorities in all jurisdictions [to] increase AML enforcement.”
cointelegraph	bitcoins-early-2018-woes-written-in-the-stars-and-moon	Bitcoin’s Early 2018 Woes Written in the Stars and Moo...	2018-01-28	 Bitcoin has prided itself on not being moved by the normal market manipulators, such as global strife and socioeconomic activities. However, there are times when it fluctuates for obscure reasons. According to some experts, the January downturn could be no surprise as he attributes it to the Lunar New Year and the significance it carries for the Chinese. The lead up to Chinese New Year is one of high spending as people book all sorts of travel and holidays, not to mention buy presents. Thus, just like Christmas and December is a time for spending in the West, January has a similar pattern in the east. Blame it on the moon With Bitcoin’s value almost halving from $20,000 in the middle of December to $10,000 at its worst in January, Wallin is both unperturbed or surprised. “The January drop is a recurring theme in cryptocurrencies as people celebrating the Chinese New Year, aka Lunar New Year, exchange their crypto for fiat currency,” explains Alexander Wallin, CEO of trading social network SprinkleBit, as quoted by Bloomberg. “The timing is about four to six weeks before the lunar year when most people make their travel arrangements and start buying presents,” he added. The holiday takes place on Feb. 16; however, the build-up is where people start to spend their money. And with the Chinese population heavily vested in Bitcoin, it has a huge role to play on the movement of the market. The thoughts are that people have been taking their profits into the build-up of the New Year, turning their Bitcoin into fiat currency to use for gift buying. Strange effects Bitcoin is steadfast in the face of other market influences, the likes that are seen to disturb the traditional stock market, etc. But this theory, if it is to be believed, highlights the way in which Bitcoin moves separately from other assets. In August, when tensions between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un were reaching a fever pitch, the entire global market fell by an average of one percent. However, Bitcoin was one of the only assets to report growth during that period. A pattern emerging While it may be hard to blame the market decline on something as otherworldly as the moon, there is some evidence to suggest that January is not a good time to be invested in Bitcoin. Early 2015 Early 2016 Early 2017 Early 2018 There are not too many patterns that have emerged in Bitcoin’s price graph over its short lifespan. However, there does seem to be some sort of correlation between this time of year. What is at least pleasing, if there is a pattern, is that a big rally often follows the January dip.
cointelegraph	bitconnect-closes-virtually-its-entire-operation-bcc-token-drops-87	Bitconnect Closes Virtually Its Entire Operation, BCC...	2018-01-17	 Bitconnect has formally closed its lending platform and cryptocurrency exchange following warnings from Texas and North Carolina regulators. The Bitconnect Coin (BCC) digital currency is down 87% today and 93% from its December 29 high of $437. At press time, BCC is trading for just $30. Ponzi-like Many in the digital currency community have called Bitconnect a Ponzi scheme, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, according to TechCrunch. Such accusations were based on the multi-level referral system and the promise of up to 40% earned interest, plus a daily bonus of up to 0.25% per day, on each loan. The promise of risk-free high returns is often typical of a scam - if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Bitconnect Coin’s website describes the currency as: “The moment you acquire BitConnect Coin it becomes an interest-bearing asset with 120% return per year. It is that simple.” Unfortunately for investors, that “interest-bearing asset” is now nearly worthless.
cointelegraph	bitconnect-ponzi-scheme-no-sympathy-from-crypto-community	Bitconnect Ponzi Scheme - No Sympathy From Crypto Comm...	2018-01-19	 What looked too good to be true ended up being just that, as Bitconnect has all but closed its doors. Long accused of being a Ponzi-scheme, Bitconnect shut down its cryptocurrency exchange and lending service this week. As stated on their website, Bitconnect had received cease and desist letters from two American securities regulators - leading to the closure of their lending and exchange platforms. Still, Bitconnect will continue to run its website and wallet service. Sketchy ‘Ponzi’ offerings Since its inception in January 2017, many were skeptical about Bitconnect services. In essence, one needed to send Bitconnect Bitcoin in exchange for Bitconnect Coin (BCC) on their exchange. Once you had BCC, you were guaranteed “up to 120 percent return per year.” Users were told they were earning interest by holding their coin “for helping maintain the security of the network.” Source: Bitconnect.co Lending platform Bitconnect’s lending platform is what really led to accusations of a Ponzi scheme, as well as cease and desist orders from regulators. Source: Bitconnect.co As the above illustration explains, users bought BCC with Bitcoin and then lent out their BCC on the Bitconnect lending software. Users would receive varying percentages of interest depending on the amount of BCC they had lent. Source: Bitconnect.co Add in the referral system seen in many other Ponzi schemes and the fact that the operation was run anonymously; it's hardly surprising that this whole endeavor has ended in tears. The lending scheme was the main draw card of Bitconnect because of its huge promise of returns. In order to participate in the scheme, you had to buy BCC - which saw the token hit an all-time high of $437.31 per BCC before it plummeted in value following the closure this week. That being said, the cryptocurrency is still alive and trading at around $35 at the time of writing. Social media burns Bitconnect Following Bitconnect’s closure, social media was abuzz with sentiments of ‘I told you so.’ TenX co-founder Julian Hosp highlighted the fact that BCC was still trading as a real head-scratcher.

cointelegraph	bitflyer-granted-eu-operational-license-now-most-compliant-crypto-exchange	BitFlyer Granted EU Operational License, Now ‘Most Com...	2018-01-23	 Tokyo-based crypto exchange bitFlyer was issued a Payment Institution license to operate in the European Union, the exchange reported Monday, Jan. 22. The license was granted to the exchange by the Luxembourg regulator, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). BitFlyer, which entered the US market compliantly as of fall 2017, already operates in Japan under a license granted by the Financial Services Agency (FSA). Yuzo Kano, the founder and CEO of bitFlyer, said in the press release, “I am proud that we are now the most compliant virtual currency exchange in the world; this coveted regulatory status gives our customers, our company and the virtual currency industry as a whole a very positive future outlook.” While the company will initially offer only a BTC/EUR pair in the EU, other virtual currencies like Litecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin Cash will be added to the bitFlyer Europe platform later this year. BitFlyer traded a total of just under $300 mln in the past 24 hours to press time, currently ranking 14th by trading volume on CoinMarketCap. Global regulation Countries all over the world have been struggling to decide how to regulate cryptocurrencies, from several US states introducing licenses to operate within regulatory framework, to China closing all of its crypto exchanges. Japan is one of the few countries to officially recognize Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies as money, a move that has allowed major Japanese banks to be comfortable investing a large amount of money into bitFlyer. Germany’s Bundesbank has said that regulation in general, which for many is an anathema to the decentralized nature of all cryptocurrencies, will only work on a global scale.
cointelegraph	blink-and-youll-miss-it-us-uk-officials-both-say-theyre-looking-at-crypto	Blink And You’ll Miss It: US, UK Officials Both Say Th...	2018-01-25	 Government officials from the US and UK have said they are “ looking at ” cryptocurrency this week as the topic gains considerable focus at the ongoing World Economic Forum 2018. Speaking separately at the annual event, US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and UK prime minister Theresa May both said that “ illicit ” or “ criminal ” use of Bitcoin was cause for ensuring appropriate regulation. “ My number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities, ” Mnuchin told CNBC. “So in the U.S., our regulations (state that) if you're a bitcoin wallet you're subject to the same regulations as a bank.” Theresa May meanwhile echoed the need to ensure Bitcoin had only bonafide uses in the UK as it prepares to leave the European Union with only limited regulation in place surrounding cryptocurrency. “ In areas like cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously, precisely because of the way they can be used, particularly by criminals,” May said in an interview with Bloomberg. “It is something that has been developing… I think it’s something that we do need to look at.” As Cointelegraph reveals insights into cryptocurrency from the world’s leaders at Davos, in the US, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton co-authored an article in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Jan. 24. Clayton’s piece is dedicated to so-called ‘ distributed ledger technology ’ and how its regulatory future should look. Echoing May and Mnuchin, SEC chairman has reiterated the need for strict oversight of the “ offer, sale and trading ” of cryptocurrencies: “ The SEC will vigorously pursue those [cryptocurrencies] who seek to evade the registration, disclosure and antifraud requirements of our securities laws,” he wrote in the WSJ. “If history is any guide, DLT is likely to be followed by many more life-changing innovations. But we will not allow it or any other advancement to disrupt our commitment to fair and sound markets.”
cointelegraph	blockchain-startup-can-help-consumers-profit-from-their-personal-data	Blockchain Startup Can Help Consumers Profit From Thei...	2018-01-24	 German startup repay.me plans to launch a Blockchain-powered marketplace which will share revenues from personal data with its community. The platform will offer users up to 100% cashback on their purchases. Retailers will be able to sell and advertise their products. Think Amazon ads. 21st-century gold In 2014, Dutch student Shawn Buckles auctioned off what he called his “digital soul.” The highest bid paid him $480. The deal included his emails, calendars, geolocation health records, etc. The news was a reminder of how we manage our personal data online. Companies collect all footprints from interacting with their products, from cookies to interests and likes, selling them to advertisers and marketers. When it comes to profiting, however, the individual consumer is largely left out of the equation. Repay.me wants to change this. It believes that profits from user data should go back to the community. It will launch a utility token, called REME-Coin, to be used as the main currency on the platform. Its ICO is set for Feb. 15, 2018. Customers will be able to use the coins also on partner sites, offline retailers, restaurants etc. Advertising on the marketplace and access to consumer data will sell for coins as well. Every token will provide holders with a certain number of ads on the repay.me platform. The coin issue price is expected to be “significantly lower” than that of ads on comparable marketplaces. Coins will be backed by user data which the company refers to as the “gold of the 21st century.” The goal is to create what is considered one of the first tokens with intrinsic value and real growth potential. The platform growth and the increased amount of consumer data are expected to influence the token value. While the coin supply is limited, the number of users, data, ads and ad formats will grow, the company explains in its whitepaper. The appeal of rewards The idea of rewarding consumers for their personal data has been around for a while. Different startups have started addressing the problem with the help of the Blockchain. A study by the Harvard Business Review (HBR) found that the Blockchain has the power to keep data safe for consumers and businesses alike. In addition to the coin, repay.me is adding cashbacks as another layer to the platform. The model will hopefully make the marketplace attractive to buyers and sellers. Repay.me CEO Mario Peter cites a research by coupon site RetailMeNot according to which cashbacks can boost average order value on online stores by as much as 46 percent. A separate report by marketing and advertising company Valassis showed that almost 80 percent of consumers describe themselves as “price-oriented” and interested in cashback-related products. A total 90 percent of them, including high-income households, use discount coupons. 100% Cashback Depending on different actions on the repay.me platform, users may receive up to 100 percent cashbacks. They will be able to refer friends, recommend products or write reviews, all of which will result in a higher cashback. Customers, who join during the ICO pre-sale, will receive a 20 percent boost on their daily cashback disbursal within the first year. Repay.me will launch a mobile app based on the Ethereum protocol. It will act as a crypto-wallet and payment solution across the platform and its partner network. The managing directors have founded another company in Liechtenstein which manages the ICO and the monetary side of the project. The launch is awaiting approval from the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority. Subject to the approval, its model may undergo “changes and/or additions [which] may affect all areas of the White Paper, such as the possible start date of the ICO, the related bonus system” and others. Repay.me was founded in 2015 in Berlin by Mario Peter and Sascha Jonas who act as its managing directors. In 2017, it received an 88,000 euro ($108,000) grant by the Investment Bank Berlin (IBB) to support the further development of its platform. Disclaimer.

cointelegraph	brazilian-government-plans-to-process-petitions-and-write-laws-on-ethereum	Brazilian Government Plans to Process Petitions and Wr...	2018-01-06	 The Brazilian government is seeking to move popular petitions, an inefficient electoral system of the country, onto the Ethereum network, to process hundreds of millions of votes on the immutable Blockchain network. In Brazil, popular petitions enable over 145 mln voters across the country to come to a consensus on important political decisions. But, for many decades, political experts and analysts have questioned the logistical issue of popular petitions, and political commentators have described the structural problem of the electoral system of Brazil as the basis for most of the country’s political issues. Gabriel Barbosa, a research associate at the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, wrote, “when people are living paycheck to paycheck, or as the common saying in Brazil goes, ‘selling their lunch to buy their dinner,’ the cost of political participation becomes high enough so that people are excluded from the political process,” emphasizing the lack of proper institutions that handle the cost of political engagement. Move to Ethereum As Joon Ian Wong of Quartz reported, Brazilian legislators led by Congress legislative adviser Ricardo Fernandes Paixão and university professor Everton Fraga are planning on ways to utilize the Ethereum Blockchain network to store and process electoral votes, as a part of a larger initiative to improve Brazil’s political system, which The Economist described as “sleazy.” The key to employing a Blockchain system in processing petitions and electoral votes is to encrypt votes onto the immutable Blockchain network as transactions, to ensure that the specific piece of data remains unalterable and invulnerable to manipulation. Essentially, processing petition signatures on the Ethereum network would require smart contracts, and the system would operate similarly as other decentralized applications that exist on the network. The electoral system of Brazil would act as a decentralized application of its own with an independent digital token, that is used to process every vote on the Blockchain. Henrique Costa, a Universidade de Brasilia law professor, told QZ that the lack of an immutable platform to collect signatures of votes had been a real issue for the government in the past. “In part this is due to the absence of a platform that can securely collect the signatures of one percent of voters. We’ve been through a sort of crisis regarding the legitimacy…of our laws. Although the popular initiative does exist, there is no secure way to collect people’s signatures so people can propose bills themselves.” Within the Brazilian electoral system, any popular petition with the signatures of one percent of the country’s populations is required to be heard in Congress. But, because of the lack of an institution and a platform that handles petition votes, the group that rallies behind a particular petition also needs to find a legislator to adopt it. Consequently, the probability of popular petitions being heard in Congress has significantly decreased, even though many petitions have gathered signatures from the one percent of voters. Mobile app Currently, the Brazilian government is exploring the possibility of using a mobile app based on the Ethereum Blockchain network with which residents and citizens can submit petition votes. Since decentralized applications can operate on mobile systems, the Brazilian petition and electoral system can operate in a similar way. Since broadcasting every single signature as a transaction of its own is highly efficient and costly, the Brazilian government will use a system called hashing to combine all of the daily votes into one transaction and broadcast it to the main Ethereum Blockchain network. Fraga, one of the two leading advisers of the project, stated that the integration of Ethereum into the Brazilian’s inefficient and impractical electoral system would be a celebration of democracy if it passes Congress and becomes implemented. He said: “It would be a celebration of democracy. With this project, we are doing what the constitution says, but in practice, it hasn’t [yet] happened.”
cointelegraph	bulgarian-police-raids-onecoin-offices-ponzi-scheme-servers-shut-down	Bulgarian Police Raids OneCoin Offices, ‘Ponzi Scheme’...	2018-01-22	 OneCoin offices were raided and its servers seized in Sofia, Bulgaria, on Jan. 17 and 18, as yet another step in a series of international raids and court cases against the highly-controversial altcoin. Although the servers were shut down, OneCoin currently remains operational. The raid took place at the request of the prosecutor’s office in Bielefeld, Germany, and was carried out by representatives of the Bulgarian law enforcement as well as European Union crime fighting units. OneCoin’s founder, Ruja Ignatova, is Bulgarian-born but has German citizenship. OneCoin, which promotes itself as a “ centralized model [that] protects its members' safety and ensures compliance on AML [anti-money laundering], ” does not fit the definition of a cryptocurrency, for it is not decentralized, does not run on open-source software, and does not have a public ledger. The documents and servers were seized from “One Network Services” EOOD, a Bulgarian company serving as a representative and distributor of OneCoin, as well as 14 other companies. 50 witnesses were questioned during the raid, but no arrests have yet been made. The company is registered officially in the United Arab Emirates as “OneCoin Ltd.,” but according to the Bulgarian police report, the company operates through “Hundreds of affiliated companies on 4 continents [...] [which] are being investigated in England, Ireland, Italy, the United States, Canada, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and many other countries.” A OneCoin representative faced charges of fraud in Kazakhstan in May 2017, and in India, police had arrested 23 people in connection with OneCoin’s pyramid scheme by July 2017. More recently, in August 2017, the Italian Antitrust and Consumer Protection Authority (AGCM) branded OneCoin a Ponzi scheme and fined them 2.5 mln euros, the first financial fine on the company. Cointelegraph has previously denounced OneCoin as a Ponzi scheme, warning readers to stay away from the coin.
cointelegraph	celebrities-could-get-a-platform-to-take-their-fans-to-blockchain	Celebrities Could Get A Platform To Take Their Fans To...	2018-01-26	 Using Blockchain to interact with fan communities, celebrities can introduce millions of new users to the crypto industry to further drive the adoption of technology. TokenStars, a decentralized platform built on the Blockchain, aims to connect celebrities with fans and advertisers, and it already counts 15 stars onboard. Supported by celebrity advisors such as world football champions Lothar Matthäus and Gianluca Zambrotta, Hollywood photographer Rico Torres and NHL top-scorer Nikita Kucherov, TokenStars targets a global celebrity management market topping $100+ bln. The startup aims to disrupt the monopoly of the top 10 talent management agencies controlling over $25 bln in contracts. Redfoo (LMFAO), a popular American DJ, hockey star Pavel Datsyuk and Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver are already using the first platform module to raise money via a Blockchain-based charity auction. " width="560"> One-stop-shop for celebrity-fan experiences Two dozens of celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Jamie Foxx and Floyd Mayweather, have already endorsed various projects on Blockchain or publicly invested in ICOs. However, most endorsements are merely ad contracts and do not represent the actual involvement in the $500+ bln crypto market. A celebrity management platform powered by the Blockchain could help stars connect with fans and advertisers directly without having to deal with agents who charge high fees. Built on Ethereum, TEAM by TokenStars aims to streamline the way brands, fans and celebrities interact with each other, whether it’s an endorsement contract, fan competition or a merchandise shopping. The end goal is different for all community members. An aspiring celebrity gets upfront funds to drive a career from their avid fans or via hard-to-get advertising contracts. An already established star can find new revenue streams by selling merchandise or exclusive communication options to fans, start a contest or a charity initiative or find new sponsors. In return, the celebrity pays TokenStars a commission from the sponsorship deals and prize money. Commission is paid in tokens, which are bought on exchanges. The growth of token value is a strong incentive for token holders. Additionally, token holders are awarded for scouting and voting for the rising stars. As a result, TokenStars aims to become a one-stop-shop for celebrity management actions. A decentralized ecosystem The TEAM platform is live, and it integrates 12 major modules divided into four layers by function. Blockchain technology ensures that a platform can provide transparency and scalability as well as successfully compete with today’s highly lucrative celebrity management industry. The first layer, crowdfunding, is already live. It includes the modules targeted at celebrities eager to raise funds from supportive fans, to get advertising contracts or to support charity initiatives, as well as at fans that want to become part of the TEAM ecosystem. To showcase its platform in action, TokenStars has already arranged two brand contracts. The Contests and Charity module launched in December 2017, is currently powering the Charity Crypto Auction, where celebrities donate some of their personal items, all of them being sold at the auction. Memorabilia items from Redfoo (ex-LMFAO), crypto-star Roger Ver, and biathlon Olympic champion Tarjei Boe are just some of the items being sold. “One of my favorite things about cryptocurrencies is that they can really make a change in the world. Whether it’s business, arts, sports or now non-profits, they attract the attention of people all over the world to the things that matter. That’s the reason I’m happy to support Crypto Charity Auction by TokenStars,” says Roger Ver, a Bitcoin evangelist and early investor. Bidding on Ver’s signed T-shirt helps to raise money for Mises Institute which promotes teaching and research in the Austrian School of Economics, and individual freedom, honest history and international peace. Another lot, a T-shirt from Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis, is already gone for a whopping $987– a 20x from the actual price. Two more modules of TokenStars platform will be out in Q1 2018. Utility token TEAM by TokenStars is the utility token used in activities on the TokenStars platform. It includes agency commission repayments from advertisers and celebrities, offering exclusive incentives to fans, and rewarding users for scouting rising stars. To ensure all activities performed on the platform are verifiable, TokenStars leverages the perks of Blockchain technology. The decentralized model ensures low money transfer costs and fast transactions, empowering the global community to participate without involving third parties. Other celebrities are already part of TEAM After successfully raising $4.9+ mln in the ACE token sale for tennis, TokenStars switches to TEAM- a decentralized Blockchain-based platform that combines sports and showbiz into an ecosystem that brings world-known celebrities, fans and advertisers under the same roof. An impressive lineup of over 15 international celebrities in entertainment and sports, including FIFA World Cup champions and NHL stars, already support the project. The TokenStars TEAM advisory board has renowned names in several industries, like football (Lothar Matthäus, Gianluca Zambrotta), tennis (Tommy Haas, Cedric Pioline, Robin Soderling), hockey (Nikita Kucherov), Hollywood (Rico Torres), poker (Alexander Anter), and more. The TokenStars TEAM presale started on Dec. 20 and it will last until Jan. 27. For a minimum contribution of 1,000 TEAM tokens estimated at 0.1 BTC, those who participate in the sale get a 30 percent early bird bonus until Jan. 27. The token sale will run from Jan. 27 to Feb. 28. Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

cointelegraph	chinas-alibaba-says-new-p2p-platform-is-not-crypto-related	China’s Alibaba Says New P2P Platform Is Not Crypto-Re...	2018-01-18	 Following recent reports that Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba launched its own cryptocurrency mining platform, the company has issued an official statement Tuesday, Jan. 16, denying that its platform is related to either virtual currencies or their mining. According to the official statement, published on the microblogging platform Weibo, Alibaba’s recently launched platform ‘P2P Nodes’ has been mistakenly reported as cryptocurrency-related. The statement further clarifies that the platform is actually a peer-to-peer (P2P) Content Delivery Network (CDN) service provided by Alibaba Cloud designed to allow users to improve their network speed by sharing unused broadband connections with each other. P2P Nodes credits users with points for validating data on its network, a concept which might sound similar to how Bitcoin miners earn bitcoins for processing transactions. However, according to Alibaba’s statement, the points in P2P Nodes are not cryptocurrency-based, cannot function as a currency and can only be exchanged for items in the platform’s own gift shop. The company’s statement further reads: “We reiterate that Alibaba Cloud has never issued a Bitcoin-like virtual currency, and it will not host any [cryptocurrency] mining platforms” Amidst continuing reports of Alibaba’s new “mining platform”, the P2P Nodes website is no longer online, according to the CnLedger news outlet.
cointelegraph	coincheck-stolen-534-mln-nem-were-stored-on-low-security-hot-wallet	Coincheck: Stolen $534 Mln NEM Were Stored On Low Secu...	2018-01-26	 Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, one of the largest in the country, was the victim of a massive hack resulting in a loss of 523 mln NEM coins, worth approximately $534 mln. The coins were stolen via several unauthorized transactions from a hot wallet at 3:00 am local time on Friday, Jan. 26. Following the hack, the Coincheck exchange has hosted a press conference to provide the details of what has happened and what’s coming next. NEM stored on hot wallet, private key stolen The hack only involved NEM. No other cryptocurrencies, including Ripple (XRP), were stolen, contrary to the early reports covered by Cointelegraph. According to the exchange’s representatives, the hackers have managed to steal the private key for the hot wallet where NEM coins were stored, enabling them to drain the funds. All the stolen money belonged to the customers of the exchange. The ‘inappropriate’ movement of the funds was reported by Coincheck to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, as well as the police later on the same day. Shortly after the breach, the company halted all withdrawals from the site, hoping to stop any further damage to its funds. When asked whether they will begin allowing “ at least” fiat currency withdrawals soon, Coincheck replied that that will be done after they have determined the best way to proceed. It has come to light that the funds were being stored on a simple hot wallet rather than a much more secure multisig wallet. Coincheck’s representatives have claimed that the security setup differs between various coins on the exchange. Other cryptocurrencies on the site are currently stored in multisig wallets, but the NEM was not. When pressed by the media, the company insisted that “ security standards were not low,” however the lack of multisig protection for NEM may indicate the opposite. The company made clear that they use various wallet types for housing different assets. Specifically, Bitcoin and Ether are stored in cold storage wallets, with Bitcoin additionally having a multisig address. Ether, “ given its nature,” is not stored on a multisig wallet. According to their statement, more than half of Coincheck’s 80 permanent employees work on systems development, including security. What comes next? Going forward, Coincheck claimed that it knows the address where the stolen NEM is currently being stored by the hackers, and is hoping to be able to track the culprits. While the company cannot currently disclose how many users were affected, they have expressed a desire to refund all the money that was lost. When asked whether they are going to resume operations or will have to declare bankruptcy, Coincheck said that ‘in principle’ they plan to keep operating. While the exchange has expressed a desire to refund all lost funds, they nevertheless are still considering how to approach the situation. Per the press conference, the “ worst-case scenario ” would be that the funds can never be returned. When asked whether they have any words for the customers, Coincheck representatives have said that they “ deeply regret ” what happened.
cointelegraph	coincheck-to-refund-all-customers-affected-by-hack-faced-by-community-support	Coincheck To Refund All Customers Affected By Hack, Fa...	2018-01-27	 Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has announced Saturday, Jan. 27, that it will issue full refunds to all of the 260,000 of its users who have become victims of the Friday NEM hack. The Coincheck exchange has been hacked yesterday, Jan. 26, resulting in a massive loss of 523 mln NEM coins, worth approximately $534 mln at that time. During a press release following the hack it has been revealed by the exchange’s representatives that the funds were stored on a single-signature hot wallet, constituting a relatively low-security environment. The company has now confirmed its intention to refund the stolen money to the affected users. According to the announcement, the refunds will be done using the exchange’s own capital. The company is still considering the exact timing and methodology for the process. However, it has already announced that the compensation for each NEM coin will be JPY 88.549, which is the weighted average exchange rate during the period from when the trading was halted to the release of the latest announcement. Coincheck indicated that they are referencing the XEM/JPY exchange rate at Zaif, another Japanese exchange which has the most trading volume for XEM globally. Furthermore, Coincheck has again confirmed their intention to stay in business, as opposed to declaring bankruptcy, saying: ”Along with our ongoing efforts to file applications to be registered as a Cryptocurrency Exchange Service Provider with Financial Services Agency, we will continue business." Community reacts favorably The theft of the NEM coins represents the largest hacking event in the history of cryptocurrency since the infamous Mt. Gox collapse, which also took place in Japan. The fact that the local community has already been “battle-tested” has likely contributed to it remaining largely unfazed by the latest event. This is most apparently reflected through the numbers, as the Japanese cryptocurrency markets are on the rise today, less than 24 hours since the hack has taken place. ã€�ãƒ“ãƒƒãƒˆã‚³ã‚¤ãƒ³ #BTC /JPY 24æ™‚é–“å¤‰å‹•æ¯”ã€‘+3.26% (+38393) 1215835 #ä»®æƒ³é€šè²¨ #Coincheck pic.twitter.com/zNCfy4wqlZ https://t.co/SutXttxbPt ã�¾ï½žã�Ÿã�¯ã�˜ã�¾ã�£ã�Ÿ — ã�Šã�¨ã�¼ã�‘çŽ‹å­� (@otoboke1ouji) January 27, 2018 NEM also responded favorably on a global scale, with a nearly 30 percent jump on Coincheck’s announcement, according to Coinmarketcap.

cointelegraph	combined-crypto-market-capitalization-races-past-800-bln	Combined Crypto Market Capitalization Races Past $800...	2018-01-07	 The combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies hit $800 bln on Sunday, just days after reaching the previous all-time high of $700 bln. The number is at over $825 bln as of press time and keeps growing. Following a two-day period of sharp decline just before the New Year, the majority of cryptocurrencies are now growing again, contributing to the rapid increase in the combined market capitalization. The latest all-time high comes just under a month after the market has achieved a total capitalization of $500 bln. This immense growth, coupled with the fact that 2017 started at a mere $18 bln combined, seems to indicate that cryptocurrency is well on its way to becoming a trillion-dollar industry. Speaking of individual coins that are driving this upward dynamic, several are of note. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is hovering at a relatively stable price range between $16,500 and $17,000, with slight growth over the past week. However, the share of its capitalization against that of the market as a whole is still at all-time lows of around 34 percent, as major competitors seem to be outpacing it. Ethereum, for example, has surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time this Friday and keeps growing. Among the likely reasons for this dynamic is the immense level of adoption of the cryptocurrency, which seems to be higher than that of the rest of the market combined. Ripple is another major producer of growth on the market. It started skyrocketing in mid-December 2017 and has already managed to displace Ethereum as the second-highest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, making its own chairman potentially the richest person on the planet in the process. However, even if you disregard the major players, there are a lot of factors as to why the numbers are growing so fast. When even meme coins are reaching billion-dollar capitalizations, countries are issuing their own cryptocurrencies, and prominent tech CEOs like Thiel and Zuckerberg are eyeing the industry, a trillion-dollar combined market cap can easily seem a distinct possibility.
cointelegraph	crypto-market-crash-not-the-new-years-present-everyone-hoped-for	Crypto Market Crash - Not The New Year’s Present Every...	2017-12-31	 The cryptocurrency market has experienced a powerful drop this Friday and Saturday. Coins were losing value across the board, with just three of the top twenty by market capitalization displaying growth of over 10 percent: Cardano, Qtum and Neo. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has dropped from a Friday high of $15,266 to as low as $12,350 on Saturday. The past two weeks have been very volatile for the original cryptocurrency, as it has achieved an all-time high of $20,000 on Dec. 17, 2017, only to hold it for a single day and consequently lose about 32 percent of that value, as of press time. The latest fall seems to be the continuation of that trend, with no recovery in sight yet. Ripple, which has just recently displaced Ethereum as the highest altcoin by market capitalization, has similarly dropped by at least 20 percent over the past two days. Despite experiencing a powerful surge this week, it hasn’t been spared from the “crypto massacre.” Fortunately for holders of Ethereum, its drop has been less prominent. A fall from $769 to $685, constituting just an 11 percent loss of value, compares much more favorably to the performance of Bitcoin and Ripple. Especially if you consider the slight recovery of 2.22 percent over the past 24 hours. Overall, 2017 has been a good year for Ethereum, seeing the coin rise from mere $8 to its own all-time high of $750 and beyond, and so far it seems to be maintaining that dynamic. Other prominent cryptocurrencies have also lost value over the past two days, including Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, NEM, Dash, Monero, and others. This year has been very positive for the vast majority of coins, possibly indicating that the crash of the past two days is a temporary retracement of that progress, which may be followed by resumed growth. As of press time, most cryptocurrencies have either started growing or slowed down their downward trends.

Almost all of the top twenty coins on CoinMarketCap are in the red on Monday, Jan. 22, with the biggest loss around 13 percent over a 24 hour period. Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching $10,000 again, a threshold that it had briefly dipped below on Jan. 17. BTC is trading for around $10,709 by press time, with a 8.95 percent drop over a 24 hour period. Ethereum (ETH) is also below $1000, trading at around $981 at press time, with a 8.47 percent drop over a 24 hour period. The market’s early year dip appears to be a repeat of previous January lows, and 2017 had already seen three large drops of 38, 40, and 29 percent. This makes Jan. 17’s over 30 percent slide of both BTC and ETH seem to fit into a previously recorded pattern. This current dip could be related to a Wall Street strategist predicting a 70 to 90 percent price drop for Bitcoin on CNBC. The only two coins up are EOS, trading at around $13.29 by press time and up 2.10 percent over 24 hours, and VeChain, trading at about $8.29 and up 6.57 percent over 24 hours by press time. Total market cap is down to around $514 bln by press time, about $100 bln less than when the year began.

According to the report, anonymous hackers have managed to run ads on YouTube that consumed the visitors’ CPU power and electricity in order to mine cryptocurrencies for the attackers. The users started posting complaints on social media this week telling that their antivirus programs detected cryptocurrency mining code in the ads that have been displayed to them by Youtube. According to the report of the cyber security company Trend Micro, the attackers have managed to place mining malware on YouTube via the Google DoubleClick advertising platform. The ads disproportionately targeted users from Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain. The vast majority - ninety percent - of ads were using JavaScript code provided by Coinhive, a controversial cryptocurrency mining platform that allows its subscribers to earn income by using other people’s computing power in an unauthorized manner. As has been discovered by Trend Micro on Friday, the YouTube ads have been responsible for a threefold increase in Web miner detections worldwide. In reaction to complaints from the users, Google - who owns YouTube - has announced that the situation has been resolved in a couple of hours. According to an email from the company, " the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms." However, there is still no precise information about the timeframe of the events as Google didn’t provide any additional data, while Trend Micro claims that the warnings about the abusive ads started emerging as early as Jan.18. Earlier this month, the software security firm Check Point issued a report about a sharp increase in the prevalence of crypto-mining malware, stating that 55% of businesses worldwide are affected by the attacks. The report declared Coinhive to be the number 1 “ Most Wanted Malware.”
cointelegraph	cryptokitties-sales-hit-12-million-could-be-ethereums-killer-app-after-all	CryptoKitties Sales Hit $12 Million, Could be Ethereum...	2017-12-11	 CryptoKitties, the Ethereum-based digital kitten collectibles game, has processed more than $12 million in sales on its decentralized marketplace. Essentially, CryptoKitties is a Tamagotchi-like game developed as a decentralized application ( dapp ) launched on top of the Ethereum protocol. Each digital kitten represents a unique crypto asset and the ownership of it cannot be altered, as it is integrated onto the immutable Ethereum Blockchain. Expensive kitties According to Kitty Sales, five of the rarest digital kittens on the CryptoKitties platform were sold for over $100,000 each, with the most expensive digital kitten being sold at around $120,000. Some analysts and researchers have questioned the value of these digital kittens, and whether the platform itself is sustainable in the long-term. Something even bigger While the vast majority of CryptoKitties critics perceive the platform as a simple collectibles game, prominent venture capital investor, Andreessen Horowitz partner, and Earn.com CEO Balaji Srinivasan explained that CryptoKitties has demonstrated frictionless international trading of digital assets on a Blockchain at a large-scale. He believes the game has proven that assets can be traded in a decentralized manner without the involvement of intermediaries. Using the same mechanism and technology that CryptoKitties uses, a digital asset can be exchanged seamlessly, through a decentralized platform. If the CryptoKitties platform is evaluated as a peer-to-peer digital assets exchange, the technology’s use case becomes more intriguing than a simple collectibles game. In the long-term, investors and traders will be able to exchange digital assets using decentralized applications on the Ethereum network. They will no longer have to rely on centralized platforms that are vulnerable to a wide array of threats and are equipped with strict Know Your Customer ( KYC ) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. " width="560"> No such thing as intrinsic value Moreover, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market have proven that the concept of intrinsic value is flawed. Value is subjective and no asset or currency in the global market is intrinsically worth a particular value. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin provided the auction of Leonardo Da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi as an example. The painting by Da Vinci was auctioned off to a Saudi price at $450 million, by Christie’s. The painting could represent $450 million in value to Saudi Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, the buyer of the painting, but to others, the painting may not be worth that amount. https://t.co/1U7FvWgFLV Crypto (kitties) is a reflection of the world at large. — Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 9, 2017 Buterin further emphasized that CryptoKitties: “Illustrates very well that the value of a Blockchain extends far beyond applications that would literally get shut down by banks or governments if they did not use one.” The value of the digital kittens on the CryptoKitties platform is based on rarity and scarcity, like every other cryptocurrency in the market with a fixed monetary supply. On top of that, CryptoKitties has demonstrated the possibility of frictionless and seamless trading of digital assets, which could be implemented at a larger scale in major industries such as finance.
cointelegraph	dapp-browsers-will-radically-accelerate-mainstream-ethereum-adoption	Dapp Browsers Will Radically Accelerate Mainstream Eth...	2018-01-02	 In 2017, several Ethereum-based decentralized application (dapp) browsers gained significant popularity, primarily due to the rise of dapps like CryptoKitties. During its peak, CryptoKitties, the digital cartoon collectibles game, was responsible for more than 20 percent of the entire Ethereum network’s daily transaction volume. CryptoKitties in particular was praised by some of the cryptocurrency sector’s experts like Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan. Srinivasan noted that CryptoKitties has demonstrated the potential of the Ethereum network to process digital asset trading in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of intermediaries. According to Srinivasan : “It's one of the first examples of what people have been talking about for years: frictionless international trading of digital assets (not just cash) on a Blockchain.” Difficult to replicate But CryptoKitties was a one-time success story of a decentralized application that reached large-scale commercial success. It did so through extensive mainstream media coverage triggered by a sudden increase in demand. It is extremely rare for an app on the Ethereum protocol to achieve the level of success that CryptoKitties did. Lessons from the past To imagine the current structure of Ethereum’s decentralized application market, one has to consider the mobile app era prior to the existence of Google Play Store and Apple App Store. At that time, users had to download apps from websites directly from the distributors and developers. The process was highly inefficient and for apps to gain popularity, a significant amount of capital had to be allocated to marketing. Over the past few months, Ethereum-based browsers have provided a better platform for users to search for innovative decentralized applications. These browsers are essentially operating similarly to the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store in terms of aggregating decentralized apps for users to peruse. Bringing together dapps and users Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong explained in a blog post that in the future, Ethereum-based browsers could increase the accessibility of decentralized applications and potentially introduce them to a larger user and consumer base. Armstrong wrote : “Our theory is that the smartphone + Ethereum + dapps offer an unprecedented opportunity to bring this to people all over the world. We’re attempting to increase the economic freedom of the world, and clean up some bad behavior in the lowest scoring countries. It can be easy to take the above tools for granted if you’ve only ever lived in developed countries. But for the majority of people living in the world today, those tools are inaccessible.” Decentralized applications launched on top of the Ethereum protocol utilize the ERC20 token standard and operate with native tokens compatible with Ether. Consequently, the trading of digital tokens can be processed seamlessly on decentralized trading platforms. Still, experts like Armstrong believe that the adoption of Ethereum browsers and decentralized applications could take many months to achieve commercial success. Once they do, however, they are poised to revolutionize the dapps market.
cointelegraph	enterprise-ethereum-alliance-appoints-first-executive-director	Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Appoints First Executive...	2018-01-17	 The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has appointed Ron Resnick, the former president and chairman of the Airfuel Alliance, as the first executive director, according to a Jan. 17 press release. Resnick also served as the President and Chairman of the WiMAX Forum, working with Intel’s Broadband Wireless Business on the launch of one of the first 4G broadband modems. Chairman of the EEA board Julio Faura stated today in a press release: “4G wireless broadband changed the world. We believe Blockchains will have a similar impact on society. Ron’s task as our first Executive Director is to build-out the organization, engage with members and foster the continued development of technical content.” The EEA, which was launched in February 2017, was established to bring privacy, scalability and security to the development of Ether and the whole Ethereum Blockchain. Resnick, who will host an EEA event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23, said in the press release: “My focus is to drive the further development of Ethereum-based technology best practices, open standards and open-source reference architectures to evolve Ethereum into an enterprise-grade technology.” Since February, the alliance has grown to 200 members, making it the largest open-source Blockchain initiative. Its member list includes founding members JPMorgan and Santander, newer members like Mastercard, Intel and Microsoft, and a number of Ether investors and Blockchain startups.
cointelegraph	equity-markets-vs-cryptocurrency-markets-weekly-performance-review	Equity Markets vs. Cryptocurrency Markets: Weekly Perf...	2018-01-28	 The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The cryptocurrency market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Developed equity markets globally continued to outperform most cryptocurrencies last week, as they have since the start of the year. The top equity market for both the past week and year-to-date is Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Index advancing 2.8 percent for the week to close at 32,255, and up 10.8 percent year-to-date. In second place was the S&P 500, up 2.2 percent for the week and 7.5 percent year-to-date, and then the Shanghai Composite, which advanced 2.0 percent for the week and 7.6 percent year-to-date. The Hang Seng has been on a tear, up seven weeks in a row and closing at a new record high for the second week in a row. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 continues its ascent into a new record high and closes strong, at the high of the week, while the BSE 30 Sensex, does the same. The Sensex finished its eighth week up in a row. Coming in at the bottom for the week was the UK’s FTSE 100 Index, down 0.8 percent to end at 7,731, followed closely by both the German DAX Index and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index, each down 0.7 percent to close at 13,434 and 23,808, respectively. It’s interesting to note that the order the equity markets lined up last week is similar to the relative performance year-to-date. This seems to be a good reminder of the importance of trends and the significance of relative performance. A trend, once set in motion, tends to continue for a while, and the relative position of markets have a tendency to be maintained over some period of time. Let’s now take a look at a few of the charts that may have something to tell us. We’ll leave the Hang Seng, S&P 500, and Sensex alone since they are in clear and strong uptrends into record highs. Nikkei 225 Index First, we look at the Nikkei 225 Index, which can best be observed with the weekly chart. For the past few weeks, the index has been stalled around the 150 percent extension, 150 percent retracement, of the prior downtrend that started from the 2015 peak, and the top parallel trend channel line. Last week it again attempted to continue its rally with a brief new high of 24,129.34. The attempt was quickly reversed with a close near the low for the week. That’s the third consecutive week that the Nikkei ended in the red and reflects the building of selling pressure. Also note that two weeks ago there was a bearish doji candle, not perfect but close enough. Further, the Stochastics momentum oscillator has turned down after being overbought for most of the rally coming off the August lows. A break below the three-week low of 23,577.07 increases the chance for further selling, with a daily close below confirming a bearish signal. FTSE 100 This next chart is a daily chart for the FTSE 100. The FTSE found resistance at 7,792.60 two weeks ago and has since pulled back. This follows a decisive breakout of a six-month basing period that took the form of a bullish ascending triangle consolidation pattern. When markets break through resistance at some point they pullback to test prior resistance as support, at least to some degree. We see that happening now with the FTSE. Note that prior resistance at the top of the triangle at 7,599 is almost an exact match with the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the most recent upswing. In addition, Stochastics has turned up from being well oversold. This makes the 38.2 percent Fibonacci price support zone a good place to start to look for potential entries, relative to your own strategy. Either way, the overall behavior of this index is bullish and the uptrend can be expected to continue following the retracement. Cryptocurrencies The following table shows the relative weekly and year-to-date performance of some of the most popular cryptos. What immediately stands out is the relative outperformance of Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum Ethereum is the only crypto with a positive performance for last week and year-to-date, and it has done so by a long shot. Year-to-date ETH is up 42.1 percent, and it was 1.4 percent higher last week. Nevertheless, overall the cryptocurrency market remains in a consolidation phase with lower volatility and therefore less predictable price patterns. What’s happened is that ETH had been lagging the other cryptocurrencies on the way up and therefore they topped and began to correct earlier. Most have not recovered much after hitting recent lows. The cryptocurrency, on the other hand, pulled back, found support and quickly recovered, and it has maintained its recovery. The other cryptos continue to face downward pressure. What this all means is that Ethereum can now be watched as a possible leading indicator for the crypto market. A sign of strength should help maintain or improve bullish sentiment in the crypto market, while signs of weakness could trigger declines below support. Here is a four-hour chart for Ethereum ( ETH/USD ): ETH has been forming a potential rising measured move following a greater than 45 percent retracement off the peak at 1,424.30 on Jan. 13. The advance off that low found resistance around the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement and the subsequent decline found support also at the 61.8 percent level. This sets the stage for a potential Gartley completion around the 1,295.21 price area at the earliest. The potential resistance zone happens to coincide with two other Fibonacci resistance levels as noted on the above chart. Nevertheless, a breakout above the prior 1,160 swing high triggers a bullish trend continuation, and this may provide some upside enthusiasm, even though short-term, to the wider crypto market. Several of the other cryptocurrencies have been forming symmetrical triangle patterns on their four-hour charts, including BTC/USD, DASH/USD and IOTA/USD. A breakout of the triangle consolidation patterns will point to the next direction of momentum. Ripple Let’s now take a look at Ripple ( XRP/USD ). Ripple is the weakest performer year-to-date, down 38.5 percent, and for the week it declined 21.4 percent. Since hitting a 3.34 peak on Jan. 4, Ripple fell as much as 74 percent before finding support at 0.85. That low completed a 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the near-term uptrend, and it was followed by a 61.8 percent retracement of the internal downtrend. What’s interesting about its chart is the relationship of price to the downtrend lines. There are a couple of clear trend lines that define dynamic resistance of the downtrend. A decisive breakout above the line will provide a bullish signal with strength confirmed on a move above the minor swing high of 1.457, and then again on a rally above the next higher swing high at 1.722. Fibonacci price levels are listed for use as potential short-term targets. The charts for the cryptocurrency analysis are provided by TradingView.
cointelegraph	ether-hits-new-record-price-high-over-900-following-month-of-strong-growth	Ether Hits New Record Price High Over $900 Following M...	2018-01-02	 Ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum platform and the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, reached a new all-time high today, trading at $914 earlier this morning. At press time Ether was trading at an average of $889 and boasting a 16.26 percent increase in price in the past 24 hours. In the past month, the price has seen over 100 percent growth, increasing from around $440 on Dec. 1, 2017 to today’s highs. Ether’s price had been fluctuating between $200-$400 since May 2017. The altcoin’s steady upward growth started in mid-December 2017, and the coin hit its previous record high of almost $880 on Dec.19, according to coinmarketcap.com. The third-largest cryptocurrency has seen astonishing growth this year, its market cap growing from $698 mln to today’s $86 bln, a 12,000 percent increase. On Jan. 1, 2017 the price of Ether was $8. Today’s price peak took place amidst increased ETH trading volumes, notably in Asia. At press time, Singapore-based exchange Coinbene was in the lead, boasting 24-hour trading volumes of $600 mln, almost 11 percent of overall Ether trading volumes. Hong Kong/Tokyo-based exchange Binance is also seeing a notable trading volume of almost $360 mln, with South Korea-based Bithumb close behind with 24-hour volumes around $340 mln at press time. Meanwhile, the entire cryptocurrency market is seeing growth today, with most of the top 20 altcoins showing 24-hour increases, several around 30 percent and one as much as 83 percent. Bitcoin (BTC) is showing a humble 4.25 percent price increase, and BTC dominance hit an all-time low today of 35.9 percent.
cointelegraph	ethereum-advisor-predicts-greater-adoption	Ethereum Advisor Predicts Greater Adoption	2018-01-09	 It may not have had the most growth in 2017, but Ethereum has regained its place behind Bitcoin as the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Not to be outdone by Bitcoin’s 1,000 percent rise in value in 2017, Ethereum also moved from $10 per Ether to $1,000 in the space of 12 months. The two cryptocurrencies enjoyed similar success, but their underlying Blockchain technology is contrastingly different. Ethereum’s flagship smart contract system sets it apart from Bitcoin and has led to it becoming the leading platform for ICOs, allowing developers to use the underlying code for their own applications - commonly known as decentralized applications (dapp). This is in essence Ethereum’s raison d’étre, providing a monetized Blockchain solution for developers to create applications as described by Investopedia. Speaking to CNBC this week, Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff says the open-source functionality of Ethereum’s protocol could well lead to mass adoption for a wide variety of Blockchain applications. "You're seeing a tremendous amount of growth across a wide variety of industries. Fintech is actually the natural area, but now you're seeing it becoming increasingly more creative — you find projects in the oil and gas industry, you're finding government using it in their applications, you're seeing it in gaming, all kinds of different areas.” The success of CryptoKitties is a prime example of how developers can use the Ethereum software to create innovative applications. The popular online game was so successful that it placed a massive strain on the Ethereum network in 2017 as it became the biggest dapp. Inevitably, the increasing use of Ethereum will see it’s price soar, according to Nerayoff. “What you're seeing with Ethereum is an exponential increase in the number of projects. There are billions of dollars being poured into the ecosystem right now, maybe 10 times more projects this year than last year, which could easily lead to a doubling, probably a tripling in price by the end of the year.” Expanding market While Nerayoff expressed bullish sentiments towards Ethereum’s growth this year, he didn’t write off the potential growth of other cryptocurrencies this year. "The entire space is increasing. There is huge interest by the public and there are more areas in which the public can invest, even in Bitcoin, so you could just see an expansion in the entire space," At the time of writing, Ethereum’s total market cap was sitting at $116 bln.

This brought Ethereum’s market capitalization to an astonishing $72.5 bln. However, as Bitcoin mounted a comeback, returning to near-record highs, Ethereum slipped. At press time, Ethereum was trading for $640. Transaction throughput The network's transaction speed and fee normalisation seem to have influenced the price increase. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin posted on Twitter Wednesday that the Ethereum network surpassed 10 transactions per second for an entire day on Tuesday. Good news: we just surpassed 10 tx/sec for an entire day yesterday. https://t.co/axOWBAvO1x pic.twitter.com/xQBA2s1XOh — Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 13, 2017 This has brought down unconfirmed, pending transactions considerably. Ethereum and Bitcoin in recent times have been experiencing huge numbers of pending transactions. According to Etherscan.io, Ethereum processed a record 828899 Transactions on Tuesday. Praise In a related development, Donald McIntyre, founder of Etherplan, has congratulated Vitalik Buterin and the entire Ethereum team on the normalisation of Ethereum’s processing speed. In a post on Twitter, he wrote: Hi @VitalikButerin @gavofyork @VladZamfir @nicksdjohnson and Ethereum team at large: Although I give you hell for the social side and policies, the last few days were a big test for the network and it is proving to be a very sound design. Congrats! 👍👍🏻👍🏼 https://t.co/zoBLBv8JJj — Donald McIntyre (@TokenHash) December 12, 2017
cointelegraph	ethereum-surges-past-600-on-ubs-announcement-of-ethereum-based-initiative	Ethereum Surges Past $600 on UBS Announcement of Ether...	2017-12-12	 Ethereum, the number two digital currency by market capitalization, topped $600 today to set a new all time high. According to CNBC, the surge comes as UBS announced they will head an Ethereum-based Blockchain initiative along with Barclay’s, Credit Suisse, KBC, Swiss stock exchange SIX and Thomson Reuters. The initiative is designed to help these companies comply with new European Union trade data standards that go into effect in 2018. Ethereum’s rise comes amongst an overall good day for cryptocurrencies, as the total market cap now exceeds $492 bln. All of the top 22 digital currencies have experienced gains today, many of them by double-digit percentages. What’s more, as Bitcoin continues its gradual grind upwards, altcoins are not giving up their gains. This is causing total market cap to inch ever closer to the magical half a trillion dollar mark. Extraordinary story Ethereum has been one of the top performers since its inception, dwarfing the huge returns that most other digital currencies have posted. Ethereum originally sold in a mid-2014 crowdsale for about $0.30 per token, which works out to about an 2000x return on investment. Put differently, $1,000 invested in Ethereum’s ICO would be worth $2 mln today. At press time, Ethereum sits at $609 according to coinmarketcap.com.
cointelegraph	european-central-bank-expects-crypto-regulation-focus-at-g20-in-march	European Central Bank ‘Expects’ Crypto Regulation Focu...	2018-01-26	 The European Central Bank (ECB) says it “expects” cryptocurrency regulation to be high on the agenda at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires this March. In comments at an event during the ongoing World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos, ECB board member Benoit Coeure added further weight to France’s economy minister Brune Le Maire’s vow to make Bitcoin a topic at the political forum. “ The international community is... preparing an answer to that and I would expect, for instance, the G20 discussion in Buenos Aires in March to focus very much on these issues,” Coeure said quoted by Reuters. Le Maire had previously expressed a desire to have Bitcoin regulation feature on the G20 agenda, with various entities repeating calls for an international regulatory effort on cryptocurrency during the WEF. British prime minister Theresa May and US Treasury secretary steven Mnuchin both expressed the need to consolidate standpoints, while former US Secretary of State John Kerry told Cointelegraph the technology “ had value ” and that people were thus going to talk about it. Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden’s deputy central bank governor has stopped short of calling for heightened control of cryptocurrencies, saying at the WEF they “ don’t meet the criteria to be called money.” “ They can be called an asset, fine, but they are not a very good version of money because it's not a very stable store of value where they fluctuate a lot,” she continued adopting a frequent narrative on Bitcoin’s use. “ And it's not a very efficient medium of exchange because you don't buy your groceries with bitcoin.”
cointelegraph	exclusive-myetherwallet-confirms-hacking-rumors-are-stupid-lie	Exclusive: MyEtherWallet Сlaims Hacking Rumors Are ‘St...	2018-01-09	 Cryptocurrency wallet MyEtherWallet (MEW) has told Cointelegraph that rumors about it being hacked are “FUD” and “a stupid lie.” In a private message today, Jan. 9, the wallet provider categorically denied accusations circling on social media that hackers had gained access to their DNS, creating a phishing scam to gather login data. The rumors that MEW had been hacked appeared to stem from developers of altcoin Ethereum Blue (BLUE) on Twitter, who posted a string of warnings about the DNS compromise, along with advice not to use MEW. Referring to BLUE’s tweets, MEW told Cointelegraph: “MEW is not compromised. They [BLUE] are either maliciously spreading FUD to harm others, maliciously spreading FUD to boost their own coin's price, or just so incompetent and were confused. Regardless, it's a stupid lie.” Several of the tweets from BLUE today have already been deleted, but a screenshot of the original tweets was published in a reddit post, which has since marked the story as “fake.” A reddit user who allegedly works for MEW replied to the post, stating that the wallet was “not aware of any compromises” and reminded users that they can always access the service offline. Official tweets from MEW several hours after the BLUE rumors had circulated did not point any fingers directly, instead opting for a more general refuting of “FUD”: Thank you to @AnirudhaPanda @altcoinio @AppletonDave @crypto_hokie @sniko_ and everyone else who looked deeper & fought the spread of FUD. Knowing people like you are watching out for the community is why we all thrive. The light will outshine the darkness. 💖💖💖 — MyEtherWallet.com (@myetherwallet) January 9, 2018 For months before today’s rumors, MEW’s site has featured a pop-up tutorial about how users can protect themselves from phishing attacks. In December 2017, MyEtherWallet dealt with an actual scam when a fake MEW wallet app appeared in the Apple App Store. The app rose to number three in the finance app category before it was taken down.
cointelegraph	former-fdic-chair-says-we-dont-ban-assets-bitcoin-just-needs-to-be-regulated	Former FDIC Chair Says ‘We Don’t Ban Assets,’ Bitcoin...	2018-01-19	 Sheila Bair, former US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chair, told CNBC’s “Fast Money” on Friday, Jan. 19 that there is no precedent to ban Bitcoin (BTC) as an asset, but there is a need for additional regulation of digital currencies. Bair had previously written a December 2017 op-ed on Yahoo along the same theme of more regulation without any bans against BTC. In the “Fast Money” interview Friday, Bair reiterated that while, “we don’t ban assets,” regulating crypto markets is necessary to prevent both money laundering and the potential for market manipulation. Bair looks favorably on CBOE and CME’s recent releases of Bitcoin futures contracts, saying: “I think that the fact that CME and CBOE launched futures actually could help because that will actually also give them [government regulatory bodies] a window into providing, getting more reporting from the underlying Bitcoin exchanges that are feeding prices into their futures products. It will give the CFDC a window and some information to make sure there’s no manipulation going on.” Bair’s current main concern with Bitcoin is that the public may be attracted by the promise of high returns and begin investing in Bitcoin and other digital currencies without a clear understanding of what these products are. In regards to the public’s overall understanding of cryptocurrencies, Bair says: “I think there’s a lot of confusion between Bitcoin and blockchain technology.” Bair currently serves on the board of Paxos, a fintech company working with Blockchain technology. She noted during the CNBC interview that she does not own Bitcoin.
cointelegraph	ft-exmo-director-released-from-kidnap-after-paying-1-mln-ransom	FT: EXMO Director Released From Kidnap After Paying $1...	2017-12-29	 Pavel Lerner, the managing director of the cryptocurrency exchange EXMO kidnapped in Kiev Dec. 27, was released today after paying a $1 mln ransom in Bitcoin, The Financial Times (FT) reports. Lerner was abducted in Kiev on Wednesday leaving his office. Ukrainian online publication Strana.ua was first to report that he was taken away by “unknown persons” in a black Mercedes Benz. FT reports they were informed of the ransom payment by Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister. Gerashchenko told FT: “He was kidnapped by an armed gang for the purpose of extorting Bitcoins. We have operative information that he paid more than $1 mln worth of Bitcoins.” In an article published today, Strana.ua reported that sources in the local police believe the kidnappers were frightened into releasing Lerner after the story of his abduction garnered so much attention globally. EXMO reps release statement Today EXMO released an official statement about Lerner’s abduction. The statement reports that the company “got a hold” of Lerner today and that he is currently safe: “At the moment, he is safe, and there was no physical harm inflicted on him. Nevertheless, Pavel is currently in a state of major stress; therefore, he will not provide any official comments in the coming days.” The EXMO statement contains no mention of a ransom paid of any amount. In the statement, the exchange repeated that Lerner’s abduction in no way affected the company’s usual functioning: “We would also like to point out that Pavel’s activity at EXMO did not involve an access to financial assets of our users. Despite the aforementioned, the platform continues its usual operations.” However, according to the company’s official Twitter, the exchange was under DDoS attack just yesterday, Dec. 28. EXMO is under the DDoS attack. The site will be available within half an hour. We apologize for the temporary inconvenience. Sincerely, The EXMO Team — EXMO (@Exmo_com) December 28, 2017 According to Strana.ua, Lerner is a Russian citizen who holds a residence permit in Poland and is involved in a number of crypto/ Blockchain startups in Ukraine. FT reports that EXMO is officially registered in the UK, but has “operations in Ukraine.” As per EXMO’s official statement today, the investigation into Lerner’s abduction continues and the identities of the kidnappers are still unknown. Once identified, the perpetrators could face up to five years imprisonment, in accordance with article 146.2 of the Ukrainian criminal code, which covers abduction for “mercenary purposes” or by a group of people “upon their prior conspiracy.”
cointelegraph	hardware-bitcoin-wallets-not-vulnerable-to-spectre-attacks-funds-safe	Hardware Bitcoin Wallets Not Vulnerable to Spectre Att...	2018-01-05	 Trezor and Ledger, two of the most widely utilized cryptocurrency hardware wallets, have reaffirmed that the recently discovered vulnerabilities on CPUs and the latest Spectre attacks have not affected hardware cryptocurrency wallets. Hardware wallets not vulnerable As Cointelegraph previously reported, Pavol Rusnak, the chief technical officer at Satoshi Labs, the parent company of Trezor, wrote: “As more people are asking: @TREZOR is not vulnerable to recent Meltdown and Spectre hardware attacks, because it has processor not affected by these. Also our firmware is always signed, so the device never runs untrusted code. Using a hardware wallet is now more important than ever.” Rusnak emphasized that users should rely on hardware wallets at this specific period of time, because Spectre attacks have drastically impacted the cloud services on which many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet platforms operate. Earlier today, several cryptocurrency exchanges including Bittrex were taken offline due to the vulnerabilities found in Intel CPUs. These weaknesses affected Azure cloud services offered by Microsoft, and by extension, the exchanges hosted on Azure. New York Times cybersecurity journalist Nicole Perlroth wrote: “Meltdown and Spectre show that it is possible for attackers to exploit these design flaws to access the entire memory contents of a machine. The most visceral attack scenario is an attacker who rents 5 minutes of time from an Amazon or Google or Microsoft cloud server and steals data from other customers renting space on that same cloud server.” Safekeeping of funds Hardware cryptocurrency wallet developers and Bitcoin experts have recommended users to move their funds from centralized online platforms to hardware wallets. Jonas Schnelli, a Bitcoin Core developer, stated: “The current privileged memory side channel attacks just confirms what many Bitcoin users already know. Don't trust your PC. Don't think applications (and private keys) are shielded. Use a hardware wallet.” Unlike exchanges, hardware wallets are non-custodial wallets that allow users to remain in full control over their private keys. When users initialize their hardware wallet, they write down 12 - 24 words which comprise a backup for their seed. With this backup, even if the wallet platform gets hacked, users can obtain their funds and move them to another wallet or paper wallets. But centralized trading platforms and wallets store private keys on behalf of their users. The result is a centralization of private keys, creating a significant security issue. Don’t use wi-fi The Ledger development team released a detailed blog post as to why hardware cryptocurrency wallets are not at risk due to Intel, AMD and ARM CPU vulnerabilities. The company wrote : “Ledger’s devices are not affected by these attacks. First of all, to exploit these flaws, the attacker has to be able to run arbitrary code. As long as you only use Ledger’s embedded apps (which is strongly recommended), your Nano S / Blue is not vulnerable to these kind of attacks.” Most importantly, because any modern machine is affected by the Spectre vulnerabilities, it would be wise not to use Wi-Fi while sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.
cointelegraph	how-chinese-bitcoin-buyers-are-getting-around-government-ban	How Chinese Bitcoin Buyers Are Getting Around Governme...	2018-01-27	 Chinese citizens are still investing in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market despite the government’s heavy crackdown. In September 2017, Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges BTCC China, Huobi and OKCoin were ordered by the government to shut down their businesses. At one point, executives of the three cryptocurrency exchanges were prevented from leaving the country, due to a government investigation into local cryptocurrency exchanges. Three months later, in December of 2017, China’s three largest cryptocurrency exchanges relocated their businesses to Hong Kong. BTCC China, Huobi and OKCoin rebranded to BTCC, Huobi Pro and OKEx, respectively. They intended to address the rapidly growing demand from Hong Kong-based investors. Shortly after their move, the three trading platforms started to see daily volumes from Chinese investors grow exponentially. Somehow, Chinese investors were managing to circumvent Chinese trading restrictions by using Hong Kong-based exchanges. How is this possible? In Hong Kong, it is relatively easy for investors to set up businesses. With less than $1,000, businesses can be legally created, which allows the opening of business bank accounts at Hong Kong-based financial institutions. Beginning in December 2017, many Chinese investors moved their funds from their Chinese bank accounts to Hong Kong bank accounts and started to trade cryptocurrencies more actively, effectively bypassing China’s restrictions. But, unlike China, Hong Kong has a substantially lower supply to meet the growing demand. While China is home to major miners like Bitmain, Hong Kong does not produce much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As such, premiums in the Hong Kong cryptocurrency market increased, surpassing even that of the South Korean market. On January 18, when the global average price of Bitcoin was around $11,500, Bitcoin was being traded at above $13,000 on Huobi Pro. Krystal Hu, a Hong Kong-based finance journalist, noted that traders outside of China have also started to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity presented by the Hong Kong market. For instance, on January 18, the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase was $11,800. Purchasing Bitcoin from Coinbase and selling it on any Hong Kong-based market would have generated $1,200 in profit. Chinese Government Concerned Hong Kong’s exchanges have also integrated widely-used fintech applications in China such as Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay. Alipay is a $60 billion fintech app that is used by more than 50 percent of mobile users. WeChat Pay, which was only used by seven percent of mobile users in 2014, is now being used by more than 40 percent of mobile users in China. The integration of the two fintech payment networks has increased the accessibility of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency OTC exchanges for Chinese investors, easing the process of investing in the cryptocurrency market. To prevent Chinese investors from buying digital currencies, the Chinese government and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), have asked local banks to disclose any suspicious transactions linked to Hong Kong-based markets. However, even this action will not be able to prevent Chinese investors from accessing Hong Kong-based markets, due to apps such as Alipay and WeChat Pay.
cointelegraph	huobi-offers-platform-utility-token-not-an-ico	Huobi Offers Platform Utility Token, ‘Not An ICO’	2018-01-23	 Huobi, the cryptocurrency exchange, has announced that they will issue a token (the ‘Huobi Token’ or HT) starting January 23. The offering will be capped at 500 million tokens, of which 300 million will be offered to investors and the remainder kept as user incentives or team rewards. The offering, though, is not to be understood as an ICO, with the Huobi press release indicating that only users who are actively participating in the platform can receive HT. “HT is not an initial coin offering (ICO). Users can only get HT by purchasing 'Point Card' on Huobi Pro. Point Card is Huobi's pre-paid card for basic service charge. 1 point = 1 USDT.” The announcement also indicates that the company will devote 20% of profits each year to a buyback program to bring the HT off the market. By structuring utilities on the network this way, the company will be able to collect fees in advance and maintain customer loyalty over the long haul. "For example, if you purchase the 1,000 HT package, it will only cost USDT 990, and you will get 1,000 HT for free. HT can be used for offsetting the trading fees.” The token offering is the latest attempt by the company to restructure their business model after the Chinese regulations regarding exchanges and ICOs.
cointelegraph	indian-banks-suspending-bitcoin-exchange-accounts	Indian Banks Suspending Bitcoin Exchange Accounts	2018-01-21	 Jan. 21 update: This article originally mistakenly claimed that the Metropolitan Bank put a halt on all wire transfers for cryptocurrency exchanges. According to a statement issued by the Metropolitan, there were no changes in its policy and the 'halt' was misreported by the media. We apologize for the confusion this article might have caused. Bitcoin exchanges are under fire in India, as many of the nation’s top banks have suspended or greatly curtailed functionality on exchange accounts. State Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank have all taken strong action toward crypto exchanges, either closing accounts or severely limiting functionality. The banks cite the risk of dubious transactions, according to local reports. The news follows the request of advocate Bivas Chatterjee who recently filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Calcutta to impose immediate regulations on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance referred to Bitcoin as a ponzi scheme before the end of last year. The international mood toward Bitcoin has continued to tighten, particularly with US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin stating that the G20 nations will begin working together to make sure that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are properly regulated.
cointelegraph	investors-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-bitconnect-following-its-shutdown	Investors File Class Action Lawsuit Against Bitconnect...	2018-01-25	 Former BitConnect investors have filed a class action lawsuit Wednesday, Jan. 24, seeking compensation from the company that was found out to be a Ponzi scheme and has shut down on Jan. 17. The class action complaint states that BitConnect issued cryptocurrency tokens that were actually unregistered securities and collected additional funds via a " wide-ranging Ponzi scheme." The complaint has been filed by six individuals on their own behalf, as well as that of all other persons who have lost their money by investing into BitConnect. The six plaintiffs stated that their personal losses amounted to $771,000. It is alleged that BitConnect guaranteed a 40 percent monthly return that it promised to generate by trading the investors’ funds on the cryptocurrency market. Ultimately, the plaintiffs claim that instead of genuinely generating revenue via cryptocurrency trading, the platform actually used the funds from new investors to meet the expectations of the existing ones. Launched in February 2016, BitConnect was a cryptocurrency community platform which introduced its own cryptocurrency Bitconnect coin (BCC) in November 2016. According to data from Coinmarketcap, the BCC has reached the peak of its popularity in Dec. 2017, when its market capitalization hit about $2.7 bln. Just days later, on Jan. 4, the state of Texas issued a cease and desist order against BitConnect for the selling of unlicensed securities which has led to the crash of the BCC token and the platform’s closure. Meanwhile, BitConnect has managed to attract a different kind of attention by releasing a bizarre video from its annual ceremony in New York. In it, the company’s eccentric representative Carlos Matos claims that his own investment in BitConnect has paid off several times over. “ My wife still doesn’t believe me,” said Matos, describing how rich he has become.

Update Jan. 26, 2:00 pm UTC: NEM Foundation president Lon Wong has appeared to confirm Coincheck was hacked, calling the stolen funds " the biggest theft in the history of the world." Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has suspended all withdrawals as a Ripple payment worth $123mln left its wallet Friday, Jan. 26. In what appears to be a problem tied to its support of altcoin NEM, Coincheck, which is among Japan’s largest exchanges, suddenly froze NEM deposits Friday. An accompanying blog post stated: “Depositing NEM on Coincheck is currently being restricted. Deposits made to your account will not be reflected in your balance, and we advise all users to refrain from making deposits until the restriction has been lifted.” The restriction then spread to NEM sales and purchases, followed by withdrawals, before the exchange subsequently stopped all currency withdrawals, both crypto and fiat. “All withdrawals from the platform are currently restricted, including JPY. Thank you for your understanding. We are doing our utmost to resume normal operations as soon as possible,” the most recent update to the blog post reads. Since operations began to shut down, Coincheck’s wallet has shifted a one-off sum of 101,265,057 XRP, worth approximately $123.5 mln. Unconfirmed reports to Cointelegraph additionally allege $600 mln of NEM has left the exchange. A massive XRP moved from Coincheck to somewhere!!! Does this relate their today's NEM trade freeze? #coincheck $xrp $nem https://t.co/9xxiIzfeSz — âš¡11outrageâš¡ (@11outrage) January 26, 2018 On both English and Japanese social media, Coincheck promised users it would provide full details in due course, while in the meantime apologizing for the abrupt cut to services. Notably, Coincheck is not registered with Japan’s Financial Services Agency - a regulator responsible for overseeing exchanges in the country - unlike several other prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, such as bitFlyer and Quoine. Reports have also surfaced of Japanese media starting to gather at Coinchek’s headquarters.
cointelegraph	john-mcafee-well-screw-up-the-future-but-itll-still-be-better-than-what-we-have-today	John McAfee: We’ll Screw up the Future, But It’ll Stil...	2018-01-25	 John McAfee has already established himself as a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency world. With his background in programming and cybersecurity, he seems to be pretty fascinated by the decentralized technology and what it has to offer to the world. We had a talk with him during the Cruise Asia, that took place Jan. 15- 19, and found out how he researches the coins to promote, whether he has any regrets about them and why Blockchain is the best thing that happened to the humanity. Crypto Daria: You've got 700,000 followers on Twitter. Do you realize how big of an influence you have in the crypto market and do you think it's positive? John McAfee: Of course! I mean for the cryptocurrency community that's a fairly large number of followers. But it's not just that. I also speak at all the major conferences, I'm close friends with Jihan Wu of BITMAIN – the main manufacturer of, virtually, all the Bitcoin miners, Roger Ver, for instance, or Brock Pierce is my party animal that I party with. I have as much influence in that arena as I do with my followers. In fact, even more. To sit down with Roger Ver and Jihan Wu and talk about Bitcoin Cash - I think vastly is much more influential than tweeting to 700,000 people. John McAfee speaking in front of the public during the Cruise Asia, January 2018 CD: How do you decide which coin to promote? How do you research them? JM : First and foremost are the principles able to actually produce what they say. Can you develop the product in a timely fashion? Do you have the team in place that understands the Blockchain, the software, the marketplace? But more importantly is something that I would like to use myself. Like Outings – hell, yes! I would love to use that program. Okay, I'll pay a dollar to get the info I can get from the app. The same with coins. I would love to have that facility - the KWHCoin. I mean I've had a lot of homes that were off the grid. There's no greater nightmare than having more electricity than you can use and this goes to waste; or not having enough. So to be able to transfer back to the electric company through tokens and someone in a place that has access to let me buy from them. Who wouldn't want that facility? So if it's something I personally want – yes, if they can do it, it's a great idea, if it's helpful to the society - there is something I would like to pass on to my children. Then, yes. I would talk about it. Because if I don’t talk about it, then who else? Nobody’s reading those white papers. CD: Do you evaluate coins differently with time? JM : Yes, of course. Everybody makes mistakes, you know. In the beginning, they said that's a great idea and then they don't pull this through. CD: Has anyone ever tried to pay you for mentioning their project and if yes, what were the projects? JM : I would say definitely they tried to pay me. I'm not going to talk about my personal finances where I make my money or from who. I set up on stage as it’s my business and it should be everybody's business. And actually, I think it's rude to even ask such questions of people. No offense. CD: Do you feel responsible for the weight of your words and subsequent pump-and-dumps that follow? JM : Absolutely not. Let's imagine: if I see something that I think the world needs to know about - I’m gonna say it. No sense in me being the only to know. I don't want to whisper it to my friends. Isn’t it far worse? The fact that people take that and pump it, and dump it - that’s their business, not mine. I mean look at on the Verge token. I said Verge would probably double in price in the next few months, well it went up fifteen thousand percent. No. Not joking. I included Verge (XVG) because it is a legitimate privacy coin and it is also selling for less than three cents. If you know investing, you know that it is easier for a 3 cent coin to go to 3 dollars, than it is for a $300 dollar coin to go to $30,000 - same rise. — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) December 14, 2017 It wasn't my fault that people go and buy it at twenty cents. I thought two cents was a lot of money! It's not my problem, you know, I'm just recommending. Because it [company] does have some privacy things to it [coin] and it has the possibility with the race protocol to actually become a real privacy point. When it's going to happen now, I don't know. But it’s sure not worth what it is. Coinmarketcap And for the other people: if people want to be greedy and to look at this arena as simply a way to make money - well then they deserve what they get. They could look underneath this and say: this is a revolution! Unlike anything that the world has ever seen. Then forget the money! Why don't you look at the utility, the power of the specific token or coin and how it could change your life and the life of your friends, your loved ones and your children. I'm not gonna stop doing that. You can throw as many rotten tomatoes at me, as you want; call me any names you want - names don't hurt me. You think I'm gonna care what people call me, what they say about me? I could care less. CD: Of course. Do you have any regrets or disappointments about the coins you've mentioned? JM : Yes, of course. I regret about FINA coin. 2nd ICO this week: FINA coin. It eliminates fraud in the maritime and aviation industries - now costing in excess of $1 Billion/year. It is also is the first coin to combat terrorism and human trafficking - my hot buttons. This one is unique and stellar. https://t.co/cWU6KJzKmw — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 5, 2018 I found out later that one of the founders was a member of a Nigerian criminal organization. It's hard to know all the facts until someone says “By the way, we resources and found this out.” I immediately tweeted and said that I apologize and I took back my recommendation. I have been presented with evidence that the FINA ICO was organized by an individual associated with a known Nigerian criminal organization. I have no proof that they will not follow through and list the coins or develop a product, but I must withdraw my support. Details coming. — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 10, 2018 But this is the nature of the business. I mean if we're in a brand new economy, brand new paradigm if I don't step in mud bubbles than I'm not doing my job. CD: What's your number one piece of advice for the crypto investors? JM : There is none. Because whatever I recommend today will change tomorrow. There'll be something that comes and replaces it. I believe that the future of cryptocurrency is in the new emerging coins technologies and creative ideas that are coming out to through the ICOs. And everybody's overlooking this. People seem to be only concerned with making money - “Is Bitcoin going to rise or fall?” “Is Ethereum going to rise or fall?” “Is there going to be another fork in Bitcoin?”,”What's that gonna be?” “Is it Bitcoin or a Bitcoin Cash?” Screw that, this has nothing to do with these things. It has to do with what's coming behind us, what's emerging from the ground and what is going to change our future. We're forgetting that these are real, life-changing, culture-changing events, attitudes, products, creations. And we have got to watch them. If not - we're gonna miss out on something and the good stuff is gonna get swamped and drowned in the garbage. That is the overall sea of ICOs. We already know, what Bitcoin is, we know what Ethereum is. Fine, do what you want with it. Start digging into the new technologies in there. There’s going to be a Henry Ford, there's gonna be the concept equivalent to the railroad, there's going to be something that will change our lives in such a beautiful way, that if we miss it, we will regret it for a lifetime. CD: Are you worried about the recent Bitcoin price dip, given your promise in case it falls? JM : Not at all. When Jamie Dimon announced that Bitcoin was a fraud, Bitcoin dropped 40 percent in a matter of hours. I didn't worry then, I'm not worried now. It has its own life. When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bircoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong. pic.twitter.com/WVx3E71nyD — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) November 29, 2017 CD: What made you make that promise in the first place? JM : I was on television and it just came out. They said “Will the Bitcoin fall?” And I said: “I'm gonna eat my eat my genitals if it’s not five hundred thousand dollars. And this is back when Bitcoin was four thousand dollars. It's since gone way beyond what I thought it would go. I thought i was wrong, so my projections are way wrong, I changed it to a million dollars. You will see, it will happen. CD: In your opinion, what prompted the recent market fall and what to expect next? JM : The same thing that prompted the original crash of Bitcoin, which was JP Morgan, one of the world's largest banks and certainly America's largest bank. All banks all terrified. Everybody's wallet is a bank now and we won’t need banks anymore. Banks are going to disappear, if they do not do something. CD: Your Twitter account seems to be a constant victim of hacks. How does it happen? JM : It's only been hacked once. I know exactly how it happened, because the people who did it contacted me. They used a new technique called SIM Swapping. At first I thought they didn’t hack my account - I can't be active. I thought they hacked Twitter, but what they did, they hacked my carrier AT&T, which is the largest carrier. So what they did, using social engineering, kept calling local offices until they found the sympathetic hero. "Oh, my name is John McAfee, I lost my SIM cards, I have a new one. Can you please change my account to this?" And eventually someone did. My phone stopped working. Then they went into Twitter and say I forgot my password, please, send it to my phone. Urgent: My account was hacked. Twitter has been notified. The coin of the day tweet was not me. As you all know... I am not doing a coin of the day anymore!!!! — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) December 27, 2017 And so they sent a code to what is supposed to be to my phone but it's their phone. They use that code, change my password and they were on for two and a half hours while I struggled to get back in. I finally hacked myself back in and through the mail. I've never heard of that technique before. It's a brand new social engineering technique of hackling. So it was not Twitter, it was AT&T. I complained to AT&T; they did nothing. What I did is that I took off two-factor authentication, if I had not had two-factor authentication, they could not have hacked me. So now, what used to be the best way to protect yourself, turned out to be the worst, because if you have your phone number in there, then they can get it; they can go in and send that. If you don't have a phone number, they can't send the code anywhere, and they've got to figure out my password, which is impossible. CD: How do you perceive the core philosophy behind cryptocurrency? JM : Well the core philosophy is one of the greatest in the world - “let's take power away from the centralized agencies!” When power coalesces, when it compresses into a large entity, it always becomes corrupt. And power always corrupts whether you're an individual or a corporation. So it [the Blockchain technology] takes that away and distributes that power to us. So what this means is that the entire structure of civilization is going to unwind and will reassemble itself in a way that it should have been from the very beginning. We, as people, having our own freedom, our own power. Not having to ask you permission or the government's permission before I can do something. Like send somebody money or receive money, or buy something as long as I'm not harming you or my neighborhood. Then why the hell should I ask permission from anyone to do anything? So this is what's happening, we're entering a permissionless world, where when you reach adulthood, wherever that is, in whatever country and it's different, in Central America, it's the age of 12 (*note: in the countries of Central America the legal age varies from 14 to 18), in America it's 21, when you become an adult, you become your own master. You don't need to ask anybody's permission to do anything. This is the change and this is what's going to take this world and give us finally the opportunity to create Eden, to create perfection. Now we will screw it, we always do, but even in screwing it up - it would be far better than what exists today. CD: And how do you see the future of the crypto industry? JM : It's going to explode. I mean we're just in the infancy right now. As I mentioned every aspect of life is getting its own coin and it should have its own coin. It needs its own coin. Because every coin has a different function or should have. So it's going to be like the Internet when it first began. Only a hundred times more profound, more deep and will have an impact that I cannot possibly ignore you foresee even five years out. CD: Thank you for taking the time! *Note from the Cointelegraph editorial team

cointelegraph	markets-stir-after-media-re-reports-s-koreas-anonymous-trading-ban-known-since-december	Markets Stir After Media Re-Reports S. Korea’s Anonymo...	2018-01-23	 Today, Jan. 23, markets are reacting a second time to news that South Korea will ban anonymous exchanges starting January 30, despite the fact that the information on the planned regulation has been available since late December and reported on since early January. After the South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) today announced the date by which the country’s exchanges will be required to allow only ‘real-name’ trading, mainstream publications reported on the known move for a second time, unnecessarily increasing FUD in an already bearish market this week. The move, which was reportedly initiated to curb speculation, requires that bank accounts used for deposits and withdrawals to virtual currency exchanges have matching, real-name accounts at the exchanges. The regulations will also ban the issuance of new virtual accounts to crypto exchanges. Not new news South Korea’s plan to ban anonymous exchange operations is nothing new, today’s announcement merely setting the exact date. Authorities had announced the ban at the end of December, but had not yet set a concrete date for when the regulations would go into effect. “ Establishment of a system for ‘real name verification of deposit and withdrawal accounts’ for settlements will be completed by January 30, 2018, ” the FSC documentation released today states. In mid-January, South Korean authorities announced that crypto exchange customers had until the end of the month to convert virtual bank accounts connected to crypto exchanges to real-name ones, noting that those who do not comply will face fines. In addition, Non-Koreans and minors will no longer be able to trade cryptocurrency on the country’s exchanges, a point that lawmakers had also previously made known. Also this week, plans to levy a combined corporation tax and local income tax of 24.2% on exchange profits for 2017 were announced, with platforms obliged to pay by March 30 and April 30 respectively. Bitcoin prices continue to fall in the 24 hours to press time, falling below $10,000 this afternoon, Jan. 23, and causing losses for multiple altcoin assets as a result.
cointelegraph	new-ethereum-based-platform-to-improve-governance-services	New Ethereum-Based Platform to Improve Governance Serv...	2018-01-26	 Huge amounts of money are being poured into attempting to resolve institutionalized flaws within government service delivery. As recently as November 2017, the government of the UK committed £20 mln (approximately $27 mln in the US). Just as fintech has emerged as one of the fastest growing modern industrial sectors, it appears that ‘GovTech’ may join it in prosperity soon. Key services which the UK’s initiative is claimed to potentially tackle, via the country’s official municipal website, are “reducing traffic jams, freeing up teachers’ time and improving the experience of patients visiting their GP.” There are logistical issues which are not sufficiently tackled by governments the world over. Furthermore, these appear to be issues which can simply be solved through improved processes: as such, their improvement via technology is a logical next step when considering the role of automation in industrial growth. The problem with nation states The fact that nation state governments cling to their authority to control these processes despite their inability to provide the best services possible exposes a significant flaw in the existing system. If others can provide a better service then perhaps it’s time that we removed this obsolete middle-man altogether - and the wasted expenses for which the public foots the bill. In this light: many citizens feel disenfranchised by the ordinance structures which their lives are governed by at present. One reason for this could be representation by a candidate they do not have faith at the national/international political level. Another might be an arguably inherent inefficiency which is enabled and encouraged by existing governance systems, as well as the vested financial interests held by influential third parties. When you think about the subject of sovereignty the first things that probably come to mind are the restrictive borders of geographic location, and ruling political leadership of national authorities. Even in so-called democratic administrations, these authorities are most often run by a political party which has received no more than 55 percent of the popular vote (or even less for coalition governments). Regimes, benign or not, have proven to be obtrusive to social, technological and economic progress in many ways - just like the barrier between government and technology itself. A decentralized marketplace for government services ‘ Bitnation ’ hails itself as a Blockchain-based solution to the drawbacks or absence of services provided by traditional governments or “service providers” as they have been called by the Bitnation’s Founder and Chief Executive Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof when speaking to Max Keiser of RT. Bitnation seeks to pioneer decentralized, smart-contract based governance and help to overcome political, economic and geographic barriers posed by borders and overreaching regulations. Superseding the structures traditionally provided by these nation-states; this new Ethereum-based platform is set to provide superior services which are “better, cheaper, and fairer in a distributed and voluntary way.” As such, people can join various competing “service providers” without having to conform to location or generalized tax without their explicit consent. The dual nature of their tokenized economy (non-tradable reputation tokens and tradeable ‘PAT’ or ‘Pangea Arbitration Tokens’) is set to discourage corruption actively. A Blockchain based neighborhood watch style service is set to be one of the first services rolled out and will act as one of the early real-life use cases for the platform. Disclaimer.

cointelegraph	new-project-to-fight-deficit-of-smart-contract-developers	New Project to Fight Deficit of Smart Contract Develop...	2018-01-28	 The number of job postings on LinkedIn related to Blockchain, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin, increased at least fourfold in 2017, according to data provided by Bloomberg Law. As the source says, the number of such jobs is expected to grow in 2018 as well. Needless to mention, skillful developers are few now and in high demand. A new project titled Fabric Token intends to solve the problem of the lack of Blockchain specialists and current difficulties in decentralized application development by setting up a marketplace and launching the application for smart contract generation. A smart way of creating smart contracts Blockchain technology is not without its own challenges. It is currently difficult for people and businesses to use Blockchain and develop decentralized applications due to lack of user-friendly interfaces, documentation, in-depth guides, the Fabric Token team states on its website. Another side of the problem is that it is extremely expensive to hire experts in the field because there are so few of them as of yet. The Fabric Token startup was founded in the fall of 2017, and it is still in its early stages now. Nevertheless, it is going to “empower individuals and businesses with easy access to Blockchain technology and smart contracts,” according to its white paper. The paper also specifies that The Fabric Token platform will consist of four main components – The Fabric Token, TokenGen, DApp Workbench and the Fabric Store. Four components to focus on The project’s inner means of payment, which is appropriately called the Fabric Token, will be used as a utility to pay for products and services within the platform. For instance, if someone wants to take advantage of TokenGen and generate secure smart contracts for their own token and crowdsale, they will need to pay the small fee in Fabric Tokens in order to get access to their code. TokenGen is due to be released in February 2018, and it is supposed to allow people to easily generate smart contracts for the token economy by going through a simple and straightforward step-by-step process. The web application called DApp Workbench is probably the main product of the ecosystem. The tool will allow businesses of any size to easily integrate Blockchain technology and smart contracts into their business process management. The software will include a desktop application, which will feature a drag-and-drop UI, allowing users to graphically build their workflows using the BPMN standard. On the back-end, DApp Workbench will use smart contract components for specific use cases to cover businesses’ needs for operations. The product will also have a cloud, where smart contracts will be tested, compiled and monitored. The final component of the FT ecosystem is the Fabric Store, which will be a decentralized marketplace for smart contract components, similar to the Atlassian marketplace. The Fabric Store will allow third-party developers to contribute smart contract components to the platform, further expanding the functionality scope of the proprietary software. The Fabric Token team plans to launch its crowdsale on Feb. 15, 2018, at exactly 10 UTC. The total supply of the tokens will reach 100 mln. The fundraiser cap is 80 mln FT equaling roughly $9 mln. The ICO is going to close either 45 days after the launch or whenever the fundraiser cap is reached. Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

cointelegraph	north-korea-accused-of-hacking-south-korean-bitcoin-exchange-youbit	North Korea Accused of Hacking South Korean Bitcoin Ex...	2017-12-21	 Earlier this week, major South Korean Bitcoin exchange Youbit suffered a large-scale security breach that led to the theft of one fifth of user funds. Almost immediately after the hacking attack, Youbit’s parent company Yapian filed for bankruptcy. In an official statement, the Youbit team told its users that 75 percent of their holdings on the Youbit exchange will be accessible and ready for withdrawal. But, to claim the rest of the funds, the company stated that investors will have to wait until the final settlement of bankruptcy proceedings. In the case of the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which once was the largest Bitcoin exchange within the global cryptocurrency market, the settlement of bankrupt proceedings have taken more than four years. Still, the creditors of Mt. Gox have not received their funds and the procedure is still ongoing. Unfortunately, for Youbit investors, it may take several months to years to receive the remaining 25 percent of their personal funds, as the settlement of bankruptcy proceedings will have to be finalized before the company can credit its customers. North Korea accused Upon the discovery of the hacking attack, the Youbit team told its clients that the company is working closely with local authorities and the South Korean law enforcement to evaluate and investigate the security breach. The Youbit team said: “Currently, we are cooperating with law enforcement and third-party investigators to evaluate the breach. We are trying everything in our capability to minimize the losses of our users and we are considering several ways to handle this situation. We would like to apologize again for disappointing our users.” According to the Wall Street Journal, sources familiar with the ongoing investigation into the Youbit security breach have discovered telltale signs and historical evidence that North Korean state-funded hackers likely engaged and initiated the hacking attack. In September 2017, security research firm FireEye revealed in a threat research paper that it has found evidence to link various cryptocurrency exchange hacking attacks to North Korea by analyzing the tools that were used to hack into South Korean cryptocurrency platforms. One of the methods used by the North Korean hacking group was Spear Phishing, the FireEye report stated, which targeted individual cryptocurrency users with highly sophisticated phishing attacks and malware. FireEye further emphasized that there is some evidence to link previous South Korean cryptocurrency exchange security breaches to North Korea. Specifically, the FireEye team wrote that the following activities were likely initiated by North Korean hackers : April 22: Four wallets on South Korean Bitcoin exchange Yapizon compromised. Early May: Spear Phishing against South Korean exchange one. Late May: South Korean exchange two compromised via Spear Phish. Early June: Cryptocurrency service providers targeted by hackers. Early July: South Korean exchange three targeted via Spear Phishing to a personal account. Given the imposition of harsh international sanctions against North Korea by the US government and the financial instability of the North Korean regime, FireEye researchers wrote that North Korean hackers have had many incentives to target South Korean exchanges. The report read: “While Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges may seem like odd targets for nation-state actors interested in funding state coffers, some of the other illicit endeavors North Korea pursues further demonstrate an interest in conducting financial crime on the regime’s behalf. North Korea's Office 39 is involved in activities such as gold smuggling, counterfeiting foreign currency, and even operating restaurants.” Korea Economic Institute hints North Korean activity In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Troy Stangarone, a senior director at the Korea Economic Institute, shared a similar sentiment with FireEye and stated that North Korea is in an ideal position to target Bitcoin companies as it has to find ways to earn back money from the recently imposed sanctions. Stangarone said : “North Korea is an ideal country to use hacking and financial tools like Bitcoin. They’re experimenting with ways to earn back lost money from sanctions.” Throughout the upcoming weeks, the South Korean law enforcement and cybersecurity agencies are expected to focus on finding solid evidence to link the hacking attack targeted at Youbit to North Korean hackers.
cointelegraph	opera-browser-addresses-cryptojacking-adds-anti-crypto-mining-for-mobile	Opera Browser Addresses Cryptojacking, Adds Anti-Crypt...	2018-01-22	 Opera, a web browser that has since December included anti-crypto mining in their integrated ad-blocker for desktop, announced today, Jan. 22, that they will add this feature to their mobile browser as well. Cryptojacking, a process by which a computer or smartphone is hacked in order to remotely mine cryptocurrency without the owner’s knowledge, uses a large amount of battery and can greatly slow down the device. Opera’s Vice President of Product Marketing Jan Standal described the process of cryptojacking in the company’s press release for their anti-mining software for mobile: “When you browse the web, there are no visual clues that your device is exposed to mining [...] A single webpage you visit can take up to 4.5 hours of your battery time, if you keep the tab open. This often turns out to be just the battery time you needed to use a ride-hailing app or check the map to get home.” The press release included a link to https://cryptojackingtest.com/, a site which shows if your device has been affected by cryptojacking. In September 2017, The Pirate Bay admitted it was using its users’ CPU processing power to mine without their knowledge. In the same month, Showtime was also caught using its visitors’ devices to mine, which they posited as their way of getting around ad-blockers. Both The Pirate Bay and Showtime were mining for Monero through Coinhive, a script for mining that is advertised as an alternative to advertising.

The survey revealed that 75 percent of individuals between ages 18 to 24 have learned about Bitcoin, and 74 percent of Russia’s capital Moscow’s population is now aware of the cryptocurrency. However, only a minority of the individuals that have already heard about Bitcoin understand that Russian citizens and residents can invest in the cryptocurrency market. Over 16 percent of the individuals with underlying knowledge in Bitcoin still believe investing in Bitcoin is illegal in Russia. State of cryptocurrency market in Russia For many months, the Russian authorities have teased the regulation of its local cryptocurrency exchange market. In early October of last year, Russian authorities agreed to legalize cryptocurrencies and regulate the country’s cryptocurrency market by licensing exchanges. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was quoted by local media outlet TASS news agency as saying: “The President has spoken of the problems related to cryptocurrencies. These are difficulties regarding... money laundering and cases that are related to identification issues. That’s why we have agreed that the state should regulate the issuing of cryptocurrencies, their mining and turnover. The state should take all this under control.” At the time, Siluanov and the rest of the Russian government came to a consensus to implement strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies to prevent money laundering and cryptocurrency businesses from running fraudulent operations. In October, the Russian Finance Ministry stated publicly that it plans to regulate the Russian cryptocurrency market by the end of 2017. In December of the same year, Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of State Duma's financial markets committee, noted that a cryptocurrency bill has been introduced and it will likely be adopted in March 2018. "The problem is that we already have a lot of people who acquire [cryptocurrencies] and they are deceived, we need to give people the opportunity to work legally with it, to protect them as much as possible," said Aksakov. The Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to set up regulations for the trade of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ICOs and mining by July 2018 Earlier this month, the Russian President said in an interview with TASS: “This is the prerogative of the Central Bank at present and the central bank has sufficient authority so far. However, in broad terms, legislative regulation will be definitely required in future.” Moreover, in late 2017, Putin also requested the Russian government to regulate its cryptocurrency mining industry properly, as an increasing number of mining centers have reallocated to Russia to utilize its cheap resources and electricity. Several Russian provinces and cities have also been encouraging cryptocurrency miners to relocate their businesses from other leading regions like China to Russia, as the global cryptocurrency mining industry evolved into a multi-billion dollar market. Can Russia evolve into major cryptocurrency market? As shown in the survey mentioned above, more than a quarter of Russians that are already aware of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market still believe that cryptocurrency investment in Russia is illegal, and lack of regulations within the local market is restricting the adoption of Bitcoin. Proper regulation of the Russian cryptocurrency market would likely lead to a surge in interest, demand, and volume, allowing Russia to compete against Japan, the US, and South Korea as a major cryptocurrency market.
cointelegraph	price-analysis-jan-18-bitcoin-ethereum-bitcoin-cash-ripple-iota-litecoin-nem-cardano	Price Analysis, Jan. 18: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Ca...	2018-01-19	 After a sharp fall, the aggressive bulls jump into the fray to buy at lower levels. This strategy has resulted in huge gains for the cryptocurrency traders in 2017. However, unlike the previous occasions, we have seen a shallow pullback this time. This shows that the traders are not confident of a huge rally from the current prices. We believe a decline to the recent lows is possible. BTC/USD We had forecast an attempt to pullback from the $10,704.99 levels, Yet, Bitcoin overshot on the downside and fell to $9,300 levels. Currently, the bulls are attempting a pullback, which might lead to carrying the cryptocurrency to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern at $13,202 levels. We expect another round of selling from those levels, which is likely to sink the BTC/USD pair back to the support zone of $10,704.99 to $9,300. If this support zone breaks, a fall below $8,000 is likely. On the other hand, if the bulls succeed in holding the support zone, it will lead to starting a new uptrend. Nimble-footed traders can play the pullback. Still, others should wait for the next dip to buy. ETH/USD We expected the support zone between the trendline and $940 to hold. But Jan. 17, Ethereum broke below the trendline and fell to a low of $770. The bulls bought the dip aggressively, which has resulted in a pullback that has carried the cryptocurrency towards the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent fall from $1,424 to $770. We don’t expect a further rally from the current levels. The ETH/USD pair is likely to face resistance between $1,097.15 and $1,174.36. We anticipate a range bound trading for the next few days with the trendline offering support on declines. BCH/USD We expected the $1,733 levels to hold. Nevertheless, the bears easily broke through it, and Bitcoin Cash fell to a low of $1,364.9657 Jan 18. The current pullback is likely to face resistance at the $2,072 levels, which was the support of the range previously. The subsequent downturn is likely to confirm whether the bottom has been made at $1,364.9657 or will the cryptocurrency fall to $1,194. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair sustains above $2,072 for a day. XRP/USD We had forecast a fall to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the latest rally. But, Ripple fell close to the 78.6 percent retracement levels, which coincided with the lower end of the descending channel. The present pullback might face resistance at the 20-day EMA, above which, a move to $2.2 might take place, where the XRP/USD pair will face resistance from the trendline, which had previously acted as strong support. On the downside, $0.87 is likely to provide strong support. We expect a few days of range-bound trading. IOTA/USD IOTA has completed a bearish descending triangle pattern with the breakdown on Jan. 16, which gives it a pattern target of $1.1. However, the cryptocurrency took support at $1.93 levels Jan. 17. Currently, the IOTA/USD pair is retesting the breakout levels of $3.032. If the bulls breakout of the overhead resistance and $3.5, our bearish view will be invalidated. However, if the bears defend the $3.032 levels, we are likely to see another bout of selling. We don’t find any clear pattern; hence, we are not recommending any trade. LTC/USD We had forecast a likely fall to $100 if Litecoin broke below $175.199. But Jan.17 it rose from a low of $140.001. For two days in a row, the bears broke down below $175.199. Nonetheless, they were unsuccessful in holding prices down. The current pullback is likely to extend to about $225 levels, where both the moving averages converge. We don’t find any reasonable trades on LTC/USD pair. XEM/USD NEM fell close to the 78.6 percent retracement levels on Jan. 16 and Jan. 17. Thereafter, the bulls have commenced a pullback, which is likely to face strong resistance at the trendlines. The next fall towards the recent lows of $0.55134 will confirm whether the bottom is in place or is there further to go. Until then, we shall remain on the sidelines on the XEM/USD pair. ADA/BTC Cardano broke below the trendline support on Jan. 16 and Jan. 17, however, the bulls defended the support and pushed prices higher quickly. Presently, the ADA/BTC pair is attempting to break out of the downtrend line, which is a bullish sign. If successful, it’ll resume its uptrend. We, therefore want to buy at 0.000060 and keep a stop loss at 0.00004700.
cointelegraph	regulate-it-out-of-existence-stiglitz-and-swiss-bank-bash-bitcoin-at-davos	‘Regulate It Out of Existence’: Stiglitz And Swiss Ban...	2018-01-24	 The currently ongoing 2018 World Economic Forum (WEF) is so far producing negative feedback on Bitcoin as economists including Joseph Stiglitz line up to proclaim the superiority of fiat currency. Addressing Bloomberg TV audiences during the annual event in Davos, Switzerland, the professor and Nobel Prize winner said that cracking down on “secret” Bitcoin use cases would “regulate it out of existence.” “We have a good medium of exchange called the dollar. We can trade in that. Why do people want bitcoin? For secrecy,” he said. Stiglitz was joined by Swiss National Bank chairman Thomas Jordan, who in a speech also argued for tough restrictions on how Bitcoin can be used. “There is an important principle: Similar activities should be similarly regulated,” he told listeners, “and Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have some characteristics of other investment instruments.” “You can’t, on the one hand, heavily restrict cash and on the other hand permit fully anonymous instruments that to a great extent can be used for all manner of transactions.” The WEF has traditionally brought together proponents, opponents and fence-sitters on Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, with Cointelegraph in attendance at this year’s event. While cryptocurrency markets continue in a bearish cycle this month, Bitcoin price forecasts have become decidedly more down to earth, while outright critics have also softened their stance. Fellow Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Shiller, who in September 2017 described Bitcoin as “the best example of a bubble,” went on record last week to say he “doesn’t know what to make of Bitcoin ultimately.”
cointelegraph	robinhood-mobile-app-to-launch-zero-fee-crypto-trading-in-february	Robinhood Mobile App To Launch Zero-Fee Crypto Trading...	2018-01-25	 Starting in February, no-cost stock trading app Robinhood will allow users to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum with no fees whatsoever, the company has announced in a blog post Thursday, Jan. 25. The announcement is a welcome one to users of other cryptocurrency exchanges who have grown accustomed to paying fees ranging from 0.1% to as high as 4% per transaction on platforms like Coinbase. Robinhood is also allowing users to track the price of a number of other cryptocurrencies including Ripple and Litecoin, although the actual trading feature will only be available for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company’s intention is to use the zero-fee cryptocurrency trading feature as a “ loss-leader ”, allowing it to bring more traders onto its platform, which can already boast more than 3 mln users. Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev told TechCrunch: “We’re planning to operate this business on break even basics and we don’t plan to profit from it for the foreseeable future. The value of Robinhood Crypto is in growing our customer base and better serving our existing customers.” Additionally, by offering simple-to-use analysis and transaction tools, the company hopes to pull in more users as well. “ We believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to fundamentally reorganize the way money works from the ground up, putting power previously held by financial institutions directly in the hands of the people,” Robinhood added in its announcement.
cointelegraph	russia-blogger-who-boasted-about-crypto-wealth-beaten-and-robbed-for-425k	Russia: Blogger Who ‘Boasted’ About Crypto Wealth Beat...	2018-01-15	 A Russian cryptocurrency investor and blogger known online as Pavel Nyashin was attacked and robbed in his home in Leningrad Oblast the night of Jan. 14. The assailants stole funds worth 24 mln rubles ($425,000), according to local media. Nyashin was tied and beaten while a group of masked assailants stole a safe containing cash and “essential documents.” Nyashin, a self-made millionaire from cryptocurrency investing, had “boasted” about his wealth online and at meetings of well-known bloggers he attended, local media network NTV reports. The crypto blogger told NTV in a video interview: “They took the safe in the end, as they knew there was cash in the house. In it was a sum equivalent to 24 mln rubles, as well as a lot of essential documents.” The 23-year-old Nyashin from St. Petersburg had previously made known about his successes online while advising on how to become rich from cryptocurrency, according to NTV, which ran an admonitory headline “Millionaire blogger beaten and robbed for boasting.” According to Russian-language cryptocurrency news outlet ForkLog, Nyashin is the founder of the YouTube channel on crypto trading that has almost 15,000 subscribers. ForkLog also reported that the “bandits” destroyed all electronic equipment in Nyashin’s home and fled the scene in what appeared to be a Mercedes. NTV adds that the assailants further removed a laptop he used to trade on exchanges. Nyashin himself has yet to find out if his accounts have been hacked and assess the full damage done. A criminal case has been opened on the armed assault, NTV reports. Other incidents Cointelegraph previously reported on the fate of EXMO exchange CEO Pavel Lerner, who was kidnapped in the Ukrainian capital Kiev and only released on payment of a $1 mln ransom late last month. Prior to that, Ukrainian security personnel allegedly tried to steal funds from Anatoly Kaplan, founder and CEO of ForkLog, in a raid of his place of residence, as well as of the ForkLog office, in Odessa.
cointelegraph	russian-bill-draft-requires-govt-officials-to-declare-crypto-assets	Russian Bill Draft Requires Gov’t Officials To Declare...	2018-01-24	 In a recent interview with the Russian news outlet Gazeta, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov stated that the current draft of Russian cryptocurrency bill requires government officials to declare their cryptocurrency investments. The draft is currently under review by the Russian Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank with the final version of the bill slated to be released no later than July 1, 2018, according to Forklog. As of now, government officials are not required to declare their cryptocurrency assets because of a lack of proper definition and regulation of cryptocurrencies, according to a recent announcement by the Russian Ministry of Labor. Thus, Aksakov continues in his interview with Gazeta, if the new bill does define cryptocurrencies as property, “all property owned by a State Duma MP has to be declared, [including cryptocurrency].” Russia is not the only country to consider making it a legal requirement for government officials to declare their cryptocurrency holdings. Earlier this week, South Korean National Assembly’s Administrative and Security Committee has reportedly introduced a bill to require officials to declare their crypto assets. This has happened after some employees of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) were accused of insider trading of Bitcoin.
cointelegraph	russias-ministry-of-finance-legalizes-cryptocurrency-trading-central-bank-disagrees	Russia’s Ministry of Finance Legalizes Cryptocurrency...	2018-01-26	 The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (Minfin) has presented the Digital Assets Regulation Bill which defines and establishes a regulatory system for cryptocurrencies, ICOs, mining and trading, local news agency TASS reported today Jan. 25. Notably, the central bank of Russia disagrees with Ministry of Finance that cryptocurrency exchange should be legally accepted. According to the central bank, the digital currency trading rules should be only applied to tokens that would attract financial investments. According to TASS, the authors of the bill are confident that the legal status of cryptocurrency would reduce the risks of fraud and provide fiscal transparency, which is expected to increase tax revenue of the government. In contrast, banning cryptocurrency trading would likely only lead to the emergence of a black market. The bill defines cryptocurrencies and tokens as digital financial assets which are not legal tender in Russia. As for cryptocurrencies and tokens exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, Russian ruble and foreign currencies, Minfin is reported to claim that it protects the funds of unqualified investors by allowing trading only via authorized cryptocurrency exchange operators. Concerning ICOs, tokens are allowed to be issued by legal entities or private operators for the purpose of fundraising. ICOs must be accompanied with legal documentation that discloses the details of the contract such as the issuer’s full name, physical location, official website and token’s price. According to the document, non-licensed investors will not be allowed to invest more than 50,000 rubles, equivalent to about $900 in each particular ICO. The final version of the bill was earlier reported to be scheduled for a release no later than July 1, 2018, according to Forklog, so the current version may still be altered until then.

Korea: Major Banks’ Income From Crypto Accounts Up...	2018-01-19	 Recently published data from the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) shows that in 2017 several major South Korean banks have earned 2.2 bln won ($2 mln) in commissions from virtual accounts for cryptocurrency investing, a sum 36 times higher than the 61 mln won ($57,340) made the previous year, local news agency Yonhap reports. The data on the banks’ income was gathered during an unprecedented financial probe conducted by the FSS and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), first announced Jan. 7. The probe inspected six major banks, Woori Bank, Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, NongHyup Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, and Korea Development Bank, to ensure that they were effectively preventing money laundering in their handling virtual accounts handling cryptocurrency. According to Yonhap, The Industrial Bank of Korea reported 675 mln won ($634,500), with NongHyup Bank not far behind with a reported 654 mln won ($614,760). Since last week, a wave of controversy has arisen in South Korea over the government’s attempts to more strictly regulate crypto markets, like the banning of the use of anonymous virtual accounts connected to crypto exchanges, forbidding underage citizens and foreigners to invest in crypto markets, and falsey announcing a total blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading. On Jan. 16, a South Korean petition against the regulation of virtual currency reached over 200,000 signatures, now requiring an official response from the government.
cointelegraph	s-korea-to-tax-crypto-exchanges-242-percent-in-line-with-existing-tax-policy	S. Korea To Tax Crypto Exchanges 24.2 Percent, In Line...	2018-01-22	 Local news agency Yonhap reports that South Korean government has announced Monday, Jan. 22 that it will be collecting a 22 percent corporate tax and a 2.2 percent local income tax from the country’s cryptocurrency exchanges. The tax announcement comes right after the conclusion of an unprecedented anti-money laundering probe into six major South Korean banks that showed a 36 times increase in commissions from virtual accounts linked to crypto exchanges, from 61 mln won ($57,340) in 2016 to 2.2 bln won ($2 mln) in 2017. Yonhap reports that South Korean exchange Bithumb made 317.6 bln won ($295,368,000) last year in total, so is expected to pay about 60 mln won in taxes, according to the tax percentages announced Monday. The announced tax percentages are in line with the South Korean tax code for all corporations that make a yearly income of over 20 bln won ($18.7 mln). Bithumb, which is the largest exchange globally at $2.85 bln daily trading volume as of press time, was hacked in February 2017, losing about $7 mln in mostly Bitcoin and Ether. This security breach, along with several other breaches of South Korean exchanges, has recently been more definitively linked to North Korean hackers. The South Korean government has recently been stepping up enforcement of cryptocurrency regulation within the country. Besides ordering the financial probe, the government has banned the use of anonymous virtual accounts, frozen the opening of new virtual accounts, and forbid underage and foreign users from trading on exchanges. The South Korean public has fought back with a petition to stop the recent government regulations. After reaching the necessary 200,000 signatures, the petition is currently awaiting an official response from the government.
cointelegraph	scalability-privacy-and-governance-main-problems-for-dapps-says-qtum-co-founder	Scalability, Privacy And Governance - Main Problems Fo...	2017-12-28	 Ethereum’s functionality has lured a huge number of new ICOs onto the platform, as companies seek to easily create coins or tokens with various features. However, the recent CryptoKitties DApp has proven that the network can be slowed by transaction volume. And while smart contracts have made the Ethereum Blockchain more functional than Bitcoin’s for some companies, security risks remain a reality. The Qtum Blockchain hopes to provide an alternative to Ethereum and is getting heavy attention as of late. The company’s cryptocurrency QTUM has risen substantially in recent weeks, from $12.31 at the beginning of December to about $51 at press time. Cointelegraph recently had the opportunity to speak with Jordan Earls, co-founder of the Qtum project, lead developer and co-chair of the Smart Contracts Alliance, to understand how Qtum is distinguishing itself from other Blockchain solutions. Cointelegraph: Thanks for taking the time to sit down with us. So help our readers understand how Qtum is unique from the Ethereum Blockchain for DApps? Jordan Earls: Qtum is mostly compatible with the Ethereum DApp ecosystem, but offers many technological advances "behind the scenes." DApp developers can, of course, use Solidity and their existing Ethereum knowledge to create a Qtum DApp, but there are more benefits beyond that. One of our biggest advantages is that we use the "UTXO" Blockchain model. Basically, what that means is that we can use the widely popular SPV protocol created by the Bitcoin ecosystem in order to bring lightweight smart contract interactions to mobile and IoT devices. This is why Qtum is ideal for DApps that heavily rely on Mobile and IoT type use cases. CT: What do you see as the principal problems that existing DApp platforms are currently facing? JE: Bitcoin is designed to be a currency, it's simple, secure and stable. It's not a platform because its script language has limited flexibility. So when we are talking about a DApp Platform, we are talking about infinite flexibility. Only through Turing Complete Smart contact programming language, we can have infinite flexibility, then people can build decentralized applications. Right now, personally I think all DApp Platforms are far away from maturity, even Ethereum and Qtum are facing a few principal problems: first of all, scalability, since the decentralization and speed are always a trade-off for a public Blockchain. Right now, for Ethereum the TPS (transactions per second) capacity is around 15-20, it's far away to support thousands of DApps, and even though Qtum’s TPS is around 60-70 for the mainnet, it's still not enough for the future. The solution for scalability is a layered network or off-chain channels. The second principal problem is independence and privacy. For a platform (think about the Android Platform) each application is independent from each other, the PayPal application downtime will not affect your google maps application. We need to figure out a way to make DApps have less dependency on each other (for example, the CryptoKitty DApps should not stop the fundamental transaction between two people who just want to transfer a $100 in Ether). For privacy, especially for some business use cases (like a transaction between bank A and bank B should never leak to bank C), we are finding some solutions now. I think in the future, based on zero knowledge proofs, we can have a better smart contract architecture. The third problem is the governance model for DApps. Right now, for Bitcoin and Ethereum, we do not have a clear governance model, so it's hard to make decisions and achieve consensus when some emergency things happen. How can we have a better governance model for all the participants? Qtum designed the decentralized governance protocols. For example through smart contracts, we can monitor some network parameters, like Gas price, Gas limit, and more. This makes it easier to solve the forking problems, but the governance problem is still an open question for the Blockchain industry. Qtum also implements the Decentralized Governance Protocol which allows us to quickly change parameters on the Blockchain to mitigate attacks as they happen, without requiring a fork or other network disruption. CT: How does Qtum plan to deal with Ethereum scalability issues that have recently come to light? JE: Qtum provides some partial answers to the scalability problems right now, with more solutions planned for the future. First, the Qtum Blockchain implements the Decentralized Governance Protocol that allows us to quickly adjust network parameters to react to scaling or security problems. For instance, it is possible for the governing parties on the Qtum Blockchain to vote to increase the blocksize from 2 MB to 4 MB. If the governing parties agree and the proposal passes, then the network rules are changed instantly, with no software upgrade or network downtime required. In our testing, the Qtum Blockchain supports about 70 transactions. Being based on the UTXO model of Blockchains allows us to process some transactions in parallel and is thus capable of scaling to higher numbers in the future. We are currently working on the Qtum x86 VM. This basically will allow for smart contracts to be executed on the Blockchain more efficiently and with lower gas costs. It also implements features to allow more transactions to be processed in parallel, and even allows for multi-threaded smart contract code. And finally, we also believe that the ultimate solution to achieving thousands of transactions per second and more is to move more transactions off-chain so that they do not consume any resources on the Blockchain. We currently have a prototype lightning network functioning on our testnet, and Qtum is compatible with Raiden network technology as well. We are currently designing and researching a hybrid lightning network based on the best parts of both Raiden and lightning technology. CT: So what do you think has been behind the recent rise in Qtum price? JE: We’re not too sure to be honest. Markets are unpredictable. If we were to guess though, it would be the market reacting to our plans over the next year. Also, there is some speculation around the UBTC announcement that an airdrop will happen for Qtum holders that means for each 100 Qtum held, they get one UBTC. CT: Tell us what is the most exciting use case for which consumer-ready DApps already exist (other than ICOs)? JE: It's a hard question, because from my understanding when we talk about Blockchain, we are talking two things - one is cryptocurrency, and another is Trustless Platform (DApps). Even today, people claim we have a few hundreds DApps, but most of them are not real DApps. They’re more like a centralized application with a cryptocurrency payment solution. One of the exciting areas I have big interest is using Blockchain to rebuild the digital contents (movies, music, ebooks, short videos, etc) and the entertainment industry. Like you could download movies (copyright already registered on Blockchain) from everywhere on the Internet, and everyone could help distribute the movies and earn some money (decentralized channels). Then when you watch it, the system will charge you for it through the smart contract. Personally, I think that’s the really ideal DApp on Blockchain and everyone could use it on their mobile phones. If it happens, we may not need the Apple App Store or Google Play anymore. It will be a big innovation for application developers and the software industry.
cointelegraph	security-alert-mist-browser-bug-puts-private-keys-in-danger	Security Alert: Mist Browser Bug Puts Private Keys in...	2017-12-15	 A post on the Ethereum blog today informs users of a bug in Mist Browser Beta that could potentially allow private keys to be stolen by malicious websites. The vulnerability affects Mist Browser Beta v0.9.3 and below. A security alert from the Mist team published today on the Ethereum blog highlights how security update discrepancies across Mist, its underlying platform Electron, and the Chromium browser could compromise data privacy. The alert states: “Due to a Chromium vulnerability affecting all released versions of the Mist Browser Beta v0.9.3 and below, we are issuing this alert warning users not to browse untrusted websites with Mist Browser Beta at this time.” However they note that users of the Ethereum Wallet desktop app are not affected. In the period following high-profile Ethereum-related security issues, notably Parity’s notorious hack and accidental quarantine of funds, developers are conspicuously keen to highlight their commitment to keeping on top of new problems. The complex three-tier setup in Mist, Electron and Chromium nonetheless presents hurdles to security. In the security alert, the Mist team explains the complexities involved that cause vulnerability, saying: “A core problem with the current architecture is that any 0-day Chromium vulnerability is several patch-steps away from Mist: first Chromium needs to be patched, then Electron needs to update the Chromium version, and finally, Mist needs to update to the new Electron version.” Mist browser users are advised to follow a seven-step checklist to ensure maximum safety: Avoid keeping large quantities of Ether or tokens in private keys on an online computer. Back up your private keys. Do not visit untrusted websites with Mist. Do not use Mist on untrusted networks. Keep your day-to-day browser updated. Keep track of your Operating System and anti-virus updates. Learn how to verify file checksums.
cointelegraph	smart-contracts-are-taking-over-functions-of-lawyers-expert-blog	Smart Contracts Are Taking Over Functions of Lawyers:...	2018-01-12	 Expert Blog is Cointelegraph’s new series of articles by crypto industry leaders. It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com. After reading about how a partner in one of the biggest and most prestigious international law firms was busted by an undercover US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) agent for trying to garner Bitcoins in a corrupt transaction from a Silicon Valley tech company, it’s likely you won’t feel sad about smart contracts beginning to take over certain functions of lawyers. You might even secretly thank Ethererum’s co-inventor Vitalik Buterin, for it. “My life is over” A calm lobby of Hilton Garden Hill in Cupertino, CA was transformed into a crime scene exactly at 9:55:10 am on Jan. 31, 2017 when a man, shrieked “my life is over” as he was being handcuffed and arrested by FBI agent William Scanlon. The arrested man was using a fake name “Dan” and wearing an obvious wig to disguise his identity. Unfortunately, his cover was blown when the Scanlon, who worked at FBI’s public corruption division, identified him in his report as no other than Jeffrey Wertkin, a partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld who was an ex-US Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutor. Apparently, Wertkin, while still working at the DOJ in Washington DC, stole whistleblower complaints brought against a Silicon Valley tech company, which was sealed from public view. To give the tech company a leg up in the government’s ongoing investigation and to obstruct justice, Wertkin tried selling these sealed whistleblower complaints against the tech company, in exchange for 310 “untraceable” Bitcoins worth $310,000, but was instead busted by the FBI. Wertkin’s dreams of becoming an “undetectable” Bitcoin millionaire was shattered on Nov. 29, 2017 -- when Bitcoin was trading at $7,000 – and when he pleaded guilty to two charges of obstruction of justice and one count of transporting stolen goods across state lines. DOJ prosecutors said they would seek 30 to 37 months of prison time when he’s sentenced on March 14, 2018. The law firm has since fired Wertkin. Blockchain to replace functions of lawyer It should be noted that Bitcoins are ill-suited for corrupt transactions. Because, Bitcoin transactions are tracked and made public using Blockchain, which is a digital ledger distributed over a network of computers rather than located on a single or multiple servers. Transactions made in Bitcoins are recorded chronologically and publicly. It is almost impossible to alter the historical records on a Blockchain and more importantly, access to a Blockchain can also be restricted. Buterin explained, “All transactions under Blockchain come with auditable trails of cryptographic proofs. Rather than simply hoping that the parties we interact with behave honorably, we are building Blockchains that inherently build the properties in the system, in such a way that they will keep functioning with the guarantees that we expect, even if many of the actors involved are corrupt.” The Blockchain’s main disruptive element in today’s commercial and economic ecosystem is its ability to eliminate the necessity to trust intermediaries to certify a transaction. This feature lends Ethereum Blockchain well to being used to create smart contracts. Smart contracts are computer protocols, or algorithms, which can verify the negotiation process or performance of contracts--to the extent, legal relationships can be reduced neatly into code-whereby clauses are automatically enforced once the pre-programmed conditions are satisfied. They are coded instructions, which execute on the occurrence of an event. “‘Smart contracts’ – can automatically move digital assets, including ‘contracts’ according to arbitrary pre-specified rules, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code,” explained Buterin. Lawyers realize that smart contract technology will be an unstoppable disruptive force for the profession. For example, Blockchain’s ledger with the inalterability of the data, mixed with smart contracts could help clients create an immutable, time-stamped and legally-defensible record of when a trademark or copyright is first used. Thus, should a client pursue registration of said mark, the evidence would be there to leverage the option in their favor. The Blockchain is the perfect mechanism for achieving these goals because by nature records in a Blockchain network are time-stamped, secured and scalable. On Jan. 9, 2018 Kodak, a camera manufacturer, announced the launch of its KodakCoin cryptocurrency utilizing Blockchain security technology, a digital ledger of rights ownership for photographers to register both new and archive work that they can then license within the platform aimed at enabling image rights management for photographers. Using the Blockchain for copyright registration and tracking makes sense, so the company’s stock price shot up 89 percent upon this announcement. "With KodakCoin, participating photographers are invited to take part in a new economy for photography, receive payment for licensing their work immediately upon sale and for both professional and amateur photographers, sell their work confidently on a secure Blockchain platform," Kodak said. The camera company's "photo-centric" cryptocurrency is being launched in an ICO to accredited investors who meet the financial threshold of-- either $200,000 in income or $1 mln of net worth - from the US, UK, Canada and other select countries under a licensing partnership with Wenn Digital. It will also involve a Blockchain-backed image rights management platform called KodakOne. On a separate note, Kodak on the same day also announced a new Bitcoin mining rig leasing business line called “KashMiner.” Users of KodakCoin and KashMiner are urged to take into consideration the US as well as cross-border tax implications when evaluating the overall economics of transactions utilizing Kodak’s new virtual currency based products.

cointelegraph	somethings-fishy-tether-auditor-dissolve-relationship-according-to-rumors	Something’s Fishy: Tether, Auditor “Dissolve Relations...	2018-01-28	 Reports surfaced Saturday night that Tether and their auditor, Friedman LLP, had dissolved their relationship. Due to the weekend, independent confirmation has not been received. Calls to Friedman LLP have gone to voicemail. It does seem unusual for either company to take such an action without issuing a formal statement, particularly since this would create a firestorm. Many in the crypto community have had concerns about whether Tether truly maintains adequate reserves to redeem all the outstanding tether tokens. The company had hired Friedman LLP to conduct an audit in an effort to resolve the community’s concern. So much for transparency Tether has been the source of much controversy for the past year, and the company has struggled to respond to critics. The company, which shares some of the same owners as Bitfinex, a major cryptocurrency exchange, wrote last fall : “Friedman LLP has been engaged to perform historical balance sheet audit procedures for Tether Limited. However, as the amount of Tethers in circulation has increased substantially in recent months, we have also asked Friedman to analyze our bank balances and our issued and outstanding token balance on an interim basis. Friedman agreed to perform consulting services for us in an effort to provide management with useful information concerning Tether’s cash position and Tether tokens issued and outstanding as of an interim date. Friedman was able to provide consulting services for us on an expedited basis, using a procedures date of September 15, 2017. These consulting services do not constitute an audit or attestation engagement, which would include a significantly expanded scope of procedures and take substantially more time to complete.” Any “dissolution” of the relationship between Tether and Friedman LLP would invite great suspicion from the community, as this would seem to run contrary to Tether’s desire for greater transparency. What is it? Tether (the company) claims to receive deposits of US dollars from investors, following which they create an equivalent number of tethers (the currency) and give those tethers to the depositor. Tether claims to have $2.2 bln on deposit in its bank accounts to back every tether token in existence on a 1:1 basis. Without an audit, though, it cannot be proven that Tether in fact has those reserves, or that they are not being used for something besides the backing of tether tokens. Suspicion and legal threats Some in the digital currency community have expressed deep skepticism over the issuance of tether tokens. It is not uncommon for the company to release massive amounts of tether, 50-100 mln at a time, which leaves many wondering who the investors are that deposit those funds. Since the disruption of Bitfinex’s banking relationships early last year, the exchange has become heavily dependent on its sister company’s tokens to move funds in and out of the exchange. Some have speculated that Tether may be operating a fractional reserve, issuing more tokens than they have backing for, and sending them to Bitfinex. The exchange then uses those tokens as collateral to create leveraged long or short positions in the Bitcoin market. Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, has commented: There's a fear going on that the recent price rise was helped by printing of USDT (Tether) that is not backed by USD in a bank account. I urge @bitfinex and @Tether_to to perform a 3rd party audit to prove their reserves. Please do the right thing. Thanks. — Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite) November 30, 2017 In early December, Bitfinex threatened to “pursue legal action” against the anonymous blogger “Bitfinex’ed” based on his claims of wrongdoing on the part of Bitfinex and Tether. This story will be updated as more information becomes available.
cointelegraph	south-korea-five-local-bitcoin-exchanges-fail-security-test-hacked-with-basic-tools	South Korea: Five Local Bitcoin Exchanges Fail Securit...	2017-12-21	 South Korean media outlet MBC has hired a security firm to test the security setup of “five Korean Bitcoin exchanges,” including Bithumb. The company has allegedly been able to successfully hack into all five of the targeted platforms, receiving access to user data and funds. As the network reports in an article, it published about its own exploits today, ‘hackers’ it hired circumvented security procedures using what it describes as “basic hacking tools.” If true, the test underlines the fragmented nature of many users’ cryptocurrency exchange security settings, as well as the setups of exchanges themselves, as larger thefts continue to occur. Just this week, South Korean exchange Youbit announced it was filing for bankruptcy after suffering two hacks this year, the second of which lost it 17 percent of its net assets. It is unknown whether Youbit was one of the five exchanges targeted in MBC’s experiment, which saw security workers set up their own accounts which they then compromised. However, it is claimed that the country’s biggest exchange - Bithumb - was successfully hacked during the test. Bithumb has itself fallen victim to major security breaches in recent months, malicious parties gaining access to both funds and sensitive user account data. As part of the hacking, MBC’s proxies gained “user IDs and passwords” and even circumvented two-factor authentication. “The wallet was penetrated without difficulty,” the article relates. “The key to your wallet, ID and password was exposed.” Various theories have surfaced regarding South Korea’s exchange hacking issues, with North Korea increasingly suspected as a major perpetrator of cybercrime in order to amass cryptocurrency. According to the report, MBC has “contacted the South Korean government” prior to publishing, to notify it about the critical security issues on the local exchanges. Official responses have yet to emerge about the MBC investigation.
cointelegraph	south-korea-intelligence-creates-task-force-to-oversee-local-cryptocurrency-exchanges	South Korea Intelligence Creates Task Force to Oversee...	2018-01-25	 South Korean financial authorities in cooperation with Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KFIU) created a task force to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges and to ensure cryptocurrency businesses are compliant with existing regulations, authorities announced on Jan. 25. It will collaborate with local cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure that money laundering and fraudulent activities using cryptocurrencies do not occur in the local market, according to KFIU. Local financial authorities will also require six major South Korean banks that have decided to support cryptocurrency exchanges to report to KFIU if suspicious activities are unraveled. Local banks including Shinhan Bank, Nonghyup, IKB, Woori Bank are expected to file regular reports to the KFIU on suspicious trading and prevent financial crimes. Stricter regulations, optimistic After officially refuting the Justice Ministry’s cryptocurrency trading ban proposal, the South Korean government has allocated significant resources to regulate the local cryptocurrency market and provide a more stable and robust infrastructure to investors within the market. For many weeks, the majority of South Korean investors in both the traditional finance sector and cryptocurrency market have been outraged by insider trading initiated by government officials working for the South Korea Financial Services Commission. Last week, Choi Heung Sik, director of the FSC, admitted that employees of the agency sold Bitcoin immediately before the false cryptocurrency trading ban announcement of the country’s Justice Minister Park Sang-ki and bought Bitcoin after the announcement. At the time, Hong Nam-ki, head of the state coordination division, said : “The government is currently investigating into the several government officials that were alleged to have initiated insider trading. Given that it is not appropriate for a government official to trade cryptocurrencies, the agency will encourage its employees to prevent from trading cryptocurrencies in the short-term.” In the aftermath of the South Korean cryptocurrency trading ban fiasco, the approval rating of President Moon Jae-in hit an all-time low below 60 percent, and the government was heavily criticized for negligence. Starting this week, to counterbalance the mishandling of the false cryptocurrency trading ban by the Justice Ministry, the South Korean government and financial authorities have begun to regulate the local cryptocurrency market and businesses strictly. Previously, the South Korean government was hesitant towards regulating cryptocurrency businesses because it feared the South Korean people would consider it as an endorsement of the market. Regulation is beneficial to local investors Up until last week, South Korean investors feared that banks would cut money flow into the market by disabling bank accounts, as the Justice Minister claimed in his controversial premature statement about the cryptocurrency market. Concerns of local investors only intensified when Kookmin Bank announced the closure of virtual bank accounts deployed on cryptocurrency exchanges. However, since then, six major South Korean banks have provided support to local exchanges, KFIU has started to regulate the market and the government has begun to consider cryptocurrency businesses as legitimate financial service providers.
cointelegraph	south-korean-government-concerned-with-scams-in-bitcoin-market-fake-exchanges	South Korean Government Concerned With Scams in Bitcoi...	2017-12-25	 The South Korean government and local financial authorities have warned investors about the emergence of fake cryptocurrency and Bitcoin exchanges. Fraudulent exchanges On Dec. 13, the South Korean government and its cryptocurrency task force formed by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Financial Services Commission, Ministry of Justice, Fair Trade Commission and Financial Supervisory Commission held an emergency meeting to discuss the state of the South Korean cryptocurrency market and draft regulations for both businesses and investors. Two of the four regulations drafted by the South Korean government during the emergency meeting were: Disallow foreigners and underaged investors from trading cryptocurrencies Properly regulate cryptocurrency exchanges as legitimate financial service providers. Given the rapidly increasing number of fraudulent cryptocurrency exchanges, platforms and activities, the South Korean government urgently moved to regulating cryptocurrency exchanges and cracking down on fraudulent operations. Last week, several fake cryptocurrency exchanges were exposed by the local Bitcoin community and financial authorities. One of the fake exchanges was BitKRX, named after Korea Exchange (KRX), the largest financial trading platform in South Korea established by KOSDAQ, South Korea Futures Exchange and South Korea Stock Exchange. The BitKRX exchange marketed itself as a branch of KRX, coaxing users into its platform by promoting its businesses as a regulated and legitimate venture led created by KRX. Chosun, one of South Korea’s largest mainstream media outlets, reported that local financial authorities and law enforcement have begun to crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges with deceptive marketing and fraudulent operations. Specifically, local financial authorities disclosed that several cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea are unregulated but are operating as legitimate businesses by utilizing the branding of leading financial institutions, like BitKRX. One member of the South Korean Bitcoin community told Chosun : “A small group of individuals that are not qualified and experienced enough to run high-traffic and large-scale platforms are running cryptocurrency exchanges in the local market. Consequently, traders are not able to properly execute buy and sell orders in a timely manner, causing major losses and difficulties for investors. Strict regulation of the market by the South Korean market will further stabilize the local cryptocurrency market.” Optimistic regulations Earlier this week, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb, which is also the second largest trading platform in the global cryptocurrency market, stated that a right set of regulations for businesses and investors would nurture the cryptocurrency market and facilitate its exponential growth. Bithumb said : ”A right set of regulations will rather nurture the (virtual currency) market, and we would welcome that.” For cryptocurrency exchanges like Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone, that process billions of dollars in trades on a daily basis, regulations are necessary because a rather large portion of investors in the South Korean cryptocurrency market are falling victim to Ponzi schemes and scams. This month, a $200 mln cryptocurrency-inspired Ponzi scheme was unraveled by the local law enforcement. 14 individuals of MiningMax, a cloud mining Ponzi scheme, were arrested by South Korean police with several charges, including economic crime and fraud. According to cryptocurrency market data provider CryptoCompare, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market only accounts for 4.6 percent of the global cryptocurrency exchange market, behind the US, Japan and Europe. A $200 mln Ponzi scheme in a relatively small market can be avoided if investors directly trade cryptocurrencies on regulated platforms and exchanges.
cointelegraph	the-house-always-wins-can-blockchain-make-sports-betting-more-predictable	“The House Always Wins”: Can Blockchain Make Sports Be...	2018-01-23	 Expanded legalized sports betting is “inevitable,” believes NBA commissioner Adam Silver. In June 2018 Americans would find out whether his prediction was correct: the US Supreme Court is expected to decide on a case that seeks to overturn a ban on gambling. New Jersey making money moves The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a law passed back in 1992, said any state that did not legalize sports betting by 1993 was prohibited from doing it. American players had to use foreign sites. Thousands of US friendly online sportsbooks - companies taking bets - are operating offshore. Most of them are based in Malta, the Isle of Man, Antigua, Curacao or even native territories, such as Canadian Kahnawake. In the US, however, betting could be legally done only in Delaware, Montana, Nevada and Oregon. But in June the Supreme Court could allow states to decide for themselves. The case was brought out by New Jersey that has been seeking to overturn the ban for years. In 2012, the rival state challenged the federal law by authorizing sports betting. But a smart move didn’t work out: the four major professional sports leagues and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sued. Since PASPA passed, New Jersey has challenged the ban six times in courts with no success. Many new sportsbooks coming This year, experts believe, is going to be different: the change is in the air. At least 18 states are planning to introduce bills this year to regulate sports betting, according to the report by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming. The court’s decision might open the door to new sportsbooks in the US. “Let’s say the Supreme Court comes back with a decision in June. New Jersey has already indicated it’s ready to move,” said Chris Grove, managing director of Eilers & Krejcik. “New Jersey could be up and running within a year.” The big question is how to manage all these old and new sports books and ensure their security and transparency. Several Blockchain companies are already working in this area. Such platforms as BlitzPredict are hoping to make betting industry smarter and more predictable for players. The company’s ICO start is scheduled for Jan. 22. From gambling to financial modeling Blockchain platforms can act as sports books aggregators providing liquidity and advanced tools for users. “We are at the intersection of Blockchain and sports betting,” said Brett Richey, CEO of BlitzPredict. “We want to build tools for Blockchain prediction markets like Gnosis, Augur, and Stox, in addition to traditional sportsbooks. There is huge consumer demand for these projects.” BlitzPredict is creating a community, where betting fans and experts could share their prediction models. Sports betting can become a financial instrument if you apply analytics and statistics. Knowing the odds will help players make informed decisions. BlitzPredict is aiming to aggregate data from prediction markets and sportsbooks to provide users with the best odds available in the market for specific events. The online betting industry is expected to grow to over $80 bln by 2022, and there’s a lot of money out there. For now, cashing out can be a headache, taking days and sometimes weeks for funds to transfer. Cryptocurrencies could help with this issue, and new Blockchain based platforms are striving to offer tokens to facilitate transactions. Disclaimer.

cointelegraph	token-gesture-arsenal-football-club-to-promote-mobile-gambling-ico	Token Gesture: Arsenal Football Club To Promote Mobile...	2018-01-25	 UK premier league football club Arsenal has made the unlikely step of partnering with an ICO for official sponsorship. As various media outlets report Thursday, the London-based club will now feature promotion of the forthcoming ICO from US mobile gambling app CashBet. The little-known operator plans to raise up to $70 mln through distribution of its CashBet Coin token, with its ongoing pre-ICO phase set to end Feb. 20. In an accompanying press release, CashBet describes itself as Arsenal’s “ exclusive and official Blockchain Partner.” While some reports suggest the deal is the first of its kind in the sporting world, Dec. 2017 actually saw Bitcoin Suisse begin a three-year sponsorship of Danish hockey team Rungsted Seier Capital. The full-on Bitcoin injection saw Bitcoin Suisse rename the team’s home stadium to Bitcoin Arena and promise to pay its top player solely in Bitcoin - another world first in sport. Despite the mixed reputation of ICOs which continues, Arsenal’s chief commercial officer appeared unfazed. “ We are pleased to welcome CashBet Coin as our partner. We are looking forward to working with CashBet Coin as they launch their new cryptocurrency,” Vinai Venkatesham said in a further release.
cointelegraph	trading-bots-to-govern-an-investment-strategy-of-newly-created-decentralized-autonomous-funds	Trading Bots to Govern an Investment Strategy of Newly...	2018-01-19	 After lurking in investment shadows for a number of years, cryptocurrencies have recently broken out into the mainstream. While Bitcoin hogged most of media attention media and attracted a large portion of newly minted cryptocurrency investors thus far, Blockchain technology has started to garner mainstream interest. Investors in conventional stocks and assets are slowly migrating towards cryptocurrencies. However, those are still very new, very volatile and their market is not easy to navigate. Here is where NaPoleonX comes in. The budding company will merge algorithmic, quantitative asset management with Blockchain technology to make investing in cryptocurrencies more facilitated, secure and profitable. Conventional trading with smart contracts In anticipation of broad conventional asset tokenization, the highly experienced NaPoleonX team has innovated the Decentralized Autonomous Fund (DAF) that makes investing in both cryptocurrencies and conventional assets on the same platform possible and robust. As trading bots are posing a real challenge to conventional asset management methods, being more effective and cost-efficient, NaPoleonX is introducing algorithms so that cryptocurrencies can be traded securely and transparently. In short, NaPoleonX is an innovative investment platform devoted to cryptocurrency holders. In addition to capitalizing on the potentials of asset tokenization and presenting DAFs, NaPoleonX is also introducing the advantages of smart contracts to conventional trading like enhanced security and reduced transaction fees. Up until now, only crypto-traders were able to reap these benefits. Even though, so far, Bitcoin and Ethereum market capitalization levels only represent a fraction of the market for other assets, that is bound to change. Crypto-trading can expand beyond altcoins and into real assets. This would mean more diversification for investors and an incredible amount of value transfer to the crypto world. Underlying technology and NPX Token The platform is described as an algorithmic crypto-asset manager. This means that the trading bots will be designed and operated to make optimal investment decisions for traders. Each DAF uses one or a combination of trading bots to fulfill its purpose. NaPoleonX smart contracts will be deployed through the Napoleon Crypto SAS company, which will hold intellectual rights for the first ten DAFs created on the platform. This intellectual property will be shared with NPX token holders. NPX token holders can get access to buy-sell signals and they are entitled to revenues from sub-licensing according to rules and regulations created by the company. Buy and sell signals are provided to NPX token holders in three speeds depending on the proportion of NPX tokens that they hold. NaPoleonX will give access to DAFs on its platform, some of which may be reserved for more experienced investors and will adhere to specific regulations. These precautions are due to the fact that NaPoleonX is the first platform of its kind to offer very scalable investments (more than $100 mln). It is important to mention that DAFs can be continuously proposed to NPX token holders with a diversity of governance models, Boton consumption and underlying Blockchains. ICO launch NaPoleonX answers two questions. The first one relates to the use of Blockchain technology in investment beyond the crypto-world and the second one relates to the merger of conventional and crypto-trading.

cointelegraph	twitter-reacts-to-crypto-fear-mongering-at-davos-wef	Twitter Reacts to Crypto Fear-Mongering at Davos WEF	2018-01-26	 While cryptocurrencies have been a talking point at previous World Economic Forum conferences, they have come to the fore in Davos this year. Following a breakout year which saw Bitcoin rise to an almighty high of $20,000, alongside the massive growth of other altcoins, it’s hardly surprising that one of the major talking points at WEF would be the future of cryptocurrency. With financial industry leaders coming together at the most important annual event on the economic calendar, media outlets took their chance to ask the top minds for their two cents worth on the current and future prospects of virtual currencies. Cointelegraph is currently attending the summit in Davos and has reported continual resistant perceptions towards cryptocurrencies. These views stem from a lack of a regulatory framework for virtual currencies which has made some of the world’s prominent banking and financial institutions hesitant about investing and supporting cryptocurrencies. UBS Chairman Axel Weber said as much in an interview with Bloomberg, saying his firm would not recommend cryptocurrency adoption or investment to its clients until there is clarity on future regulatory action. As per usual, the vibrant and feisty cryptocurrency community has been watching developments at Davos keenly, and there has been plenty of backlash in response to any FUD or untoward comments about cryptocurrencies. Twitter hits out at Davos FUD Full Tilt Capital Partner Anthony Pompliano was scathing in his analysis of the prevailing sentiment floating around in Davos towards Bitcoin. The former Facebook product and growth manager suggested that statements made by economist Joseph Stiglitz that Bitcoin was still used for shady purposes actually has the opposite effect of driving people away from cryptocurrency adoption. Joseph Stiglitz, well-known economist, is bragging to the Davos crowd that Bitcoin is used for "secret use cases" & that fiat currency is superior. My theory is that this type of fear-mongering actually drives more adoption of Bitcoin & cryptocurrencies. https://t.co/zhy5hB486Y — Pomp ðŸŒª (@APompliano) January 24, 2018 Max Keiser, host of the Keiser Report on RT, also touched on the wave of negativity around Bitcoin in Davos, but said it was too late for big financial industry players to try to stop what he described as a ‘revolution.’ Those at Davos threatened by #Bitcoin maybe could have thwarted the revolution 5 yrs ago. But now it’s too late. Go home guys, your time is over. https://t.co/SMoDw8DSxu — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) January 24, 2018 Renowned American investor Bill Gross suggested that the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has signaled a move away from centralized institutions governing and controlling money. People seem to be putting their trust in technology over government-run establishments. Bitcoin’s rise may reflect, for better or worse, a monumental transfer of social trust: away from human institutions backed by government and to systems reliant on well-tested computer code.. #WEF18 https://t.co/6hWKq6Lo6U #Davos pic.twitter.com/Ltuh6owdzm — Bill Gross (@Bill_Gross) January 23, 2018 Twitter users CryptoWilson highlighted more negative sentiment towards cryptocurrency, sharing a video of French President Emmanuel Macron speaking in favor of regulatory crackdowns by the International Monetary Fund on cryptocurrency. Macron 'triggered by Bitcoin' at Davos: "I am in favor of the IMF having full competence over the whole areas that escape regulation: bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, shadow banking [...] which can trigger crises." https://t.co/XZ1Vyj0tB4 — Wilson Trodler (@cryptowilson) January 25, 2018 Can’t be ignored Setting perceptions of sentiment aside, the truth of the matter is that the financial world can no longer turn a blind eye on cryptocurrencies. They are very much a central point of this year’s WEF and understandably so. As the 68th US Secretary of State John Kerry told Cointelegraph earlier this week at the summit, the sheer value of capital that has been poured into the overall cryptocurrency market has made it impossible to ignore. Coinmarketcap currently has the current total market capitalization at $559 bln- a steady number after a month of wild market volatility.
cointelegraph	two-new-hardware-bugs-affect-most-devices-private-keys-vulnerable	Two New Hardware Bugs Affect Most Devices, Private Key...	2018-01-04	 Researchers have published a report on two hardware bugs that allow programs to steal sensitive data on affected devices, which is “most” devices worldwide. For crypto users, these bugs are a direct threat to the security of their private keys, making the need for secure hardware storage of crypto funds even more pressing. How do the bugs work? The two bugs, known as Meltdown and Spectre, exploit security vulnerabilities in Intel, AMD, and ARM processors in any device, including PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Meltdown affects all devices with Intel chips, which are estimated to be in 90% of all computers (desktop and laptop combined), the BBC reported. Spectre potentially has an even wider reach, affecting Intel, ARM, and AMD chips in any kind of device. Meltdown and Spectre also work in the cloud. The BBC also reported that the tech industry kept the threat a secret for up to six months via non-disclosure agreements, but now fears are mounting that public awareness could lead to real-life exploits. Protecting your funds Bitcoin core developer Jonas Schnelli referred to the newly reported security flaws in terms of how they affect Bitcoin users, laying out three steps to secure cryptocurrency holdings: The current privileged memory side channel attacks just confirms what many Bitcoin users already "know" (feel): * Don't trust your PC. * Don't think applications (and private keys) are shielded * Use a hardware wallet Background: https://t.co/0avUWC44oy https://t.co/pw0cLDWyZe — Jonas Schnelli (@_jonasschnelli_) January 4, 2018 Pavol Rusnak, the CTO of TREZOR manufacturer SatoshiLabs, tweeted Jan. 4 to confirm that its devices are unaffected by Meltdown and Spectre, noting: “Using a (hardware) wallet is now more important than ever.” As more people are asking: @TREZOR is not vulnerable to recent Meltdown and Spectre hardware attacks, because it has processor not affected by these. Also our firmware is always signed, so the device never runs untrusted code. Using a hw wallet is now more important than ever! — Pavol Rusnak (@pavolrusnak) January 4, 2018 In October 2017, the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet was number eight in the list of top ten best selling items on Amazon’s Computers and Accessories section. Today, Jan.4, the Ledger Nano S is number one.

It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com. Cryptocurrencies and the Blockchain will be front and center at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos with several cryptocurrency and Blockchain-related panels on the agenda. The US government have been evaluating Blockchain technology since they have funded, collaborated and partnered with business, other countries as well as educational institutions in fostering and continuously developing innovative technologies and science. Contracts, transactions and the records of intellectual property (IP) are among the defining structures of the US economic, legal and political system. And the government agencies formed to manage them need to keep up with the economy’s digital transformation. Accordingly, Blockchain technology is under evaluation or is being i mplemented by several US government agencies to improve transparency, efficiency and trust in information sharing in: Financial management Procurement IT asset and supply chain management Smart contracts Patents, Trademarks Copyrights, Royalties Government-issued credentials like visas, passports, SSN and birth certificates Federal personnel workforce data Appropriated funds Federal assistance and foreign aid delivery The General Services Administration (GSA) GSA’s Emerging Citizen Technology Office launched the US Federal Blockchain program for federal agencies and US businesses that are interested in exploring Blockchain technology and its implementation within the US government. So far, GSA has used Blockchain to automate and speed up contracts review for its FASt Lane program. Department of Treasury The Treasury Department is running a pilot program to determine whether Blockchain technology can be utilized for supply chain management, which has accelerated, processing times, created efficiencies and strengthened financial controls in the private sector. The Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who sits on a Davos Blockchain panel, believes that forming public-private partnerships (PPP) with foreign investors to fund Trump’s public infrastructure plan without incurring additional debt will be key to fulfilling the promise to upgrade US roads, bridges, airports and other public works. It will stimulate the economic growth with the aim of passing on substantial risk of funding to the private sector. PPPs typically involve a government agency identifying a potential project, determining that there is sufficient revenue potential from the project to attract investor interest, soliciting competitive bids, and then selecting one or more private sector entities to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the project. In a PPP, the government generally owns the project but grants the private sector significant authority over its development and operation. “Working with foreign investors is going to be a critical part of any plan we put forward and public-private partnerships are crucial to ensuring that the American taxpayer does not bear the full cost of any proposed program," Mnuchin explained. The Treasury Department has also undertaken initiatives to improve the "anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)” laws for Blockchain based cryptocurrencies and formed PPPs with financial institutions, to share information. US State Department The US State Department underscores the importance of innovation in world economic development and encourages dialogue with the private sector partners currently using Blockchain technology. “The State Department supports public-private-partnerships. For example, in maximizing the impact and accountability of foreign development/assistance, Blockchain technology by bringing transparency, may address corruption, fraud or misappropriation of funds and inefficiencies within the public procurement funding process itself,” explained Deputy Secretary John J. Sullivan. Government procurement accounts for a substantial part of the global economy 20 percent of GDP or around $9.5 tln of public money. According to an OECD study, corruption drains off between 20 and 25 percent or around $2 tln annually. It accounts for a substantial portion of the taxpayers’ money and remains the government activity most vulnerable to waste, fraud and corruption due to the size of the financial flows involved. Corruption distorts the fair awarding of contracts, reduces the quality of basic public services, limits opportunities to develop a competitive private sector and undermines trust in public institutions. Countries around the world are putting technological innovation at the heart of public procurement, to reshape procurement into a strategic tool for income growth, national competitiveness and improvements in the health, economic well-being and overall quality of life. More than four-dozen countries have created national innovation strategies and/or launched national innovation foundations. These countries are relaxing foreign direct investment constraints, providing funding, financing, using public-private collaborations, tax breaks and asking the private sector from outside their borders for commitments to their countries. In maximizing the impact and accountability of foreign development/assistance, Blockchain technology may address corruption, fraud or misappropriation of funds and inefficiencies within the funding process. Department of Defense (DoD) As reflected in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 2810) as signed into law on Dec. 12, 2017, the US federal government and its agencies are exploring the adoption of Blockchain technology in various areas, after carefully studying the risks posed by this new distributed ledger technology. This evaluation will shed light on the Blockchain technology capabilities to both the Federal Government and Department of Defense IT environments. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) DHS is awarding Small Business Innovation Research grants to develop a use case for Blockchain technology’s role in border security. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Efficient communications systems and effective computing techniques are crucial to ensure the success of each NASA mission. Greater accessibility of digital information and cost-effective technologies of manned and unmanned space flights are expected to become much better integrated via Blockchain technology. A new grant from NASA to the University of Akron in Ohio will fund research to use deep-learning artificial intelligence that works over an Ethereum Blockchain network to develop a resilient networking and computing paradigm in various space communication environments. Conclusion Blockchain is not a silver bullet for digital government, but as this technology is more widely implemented, it could represent the future of smart, legal contracts and how entire industries in partnership with the US government conduct themselves in a transparent and streamlined manner.

cointelegraph	vermont-proves-blockchain-friendly-hosts-real-estate-pilot-program	Vermont Proves ‘Blockchain-Friendly’, Hosts Real Estat...	2018-01-23	 Propy, Inc., a Palo Alto-based global Blockchain real estate marketplace, announced the launch of a pilot program in South Burlington, Vermont to use Blockchain technology to record real estate documentation, the latest related development in the so-called “Blockchain-friendly” state. The startup, headed by founder Natalia Karayaneva, uses Blockchain protocols to record real estate transactions on a ledger that governments can use to tie titles to properties securely and efficiently. Propy also works to match buyers with both seller and brokers and offers information on neighborhoods where the properties are located. Michael Schirling, development secretary at the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development, said in the press release that this pilot project is: “emblematic of Vermont's long history of innovating business, insurance, and financial technology. We are fortunate to have a cutting edge statutory framework that enables the use of blockchain technology, and we will continue to work with the legislature to ensure Vermont remains at the forefront of these innovations.” In 2015, Vermont had passed a law related to economic development that contained a section on Blockchain technology. The law mandated that a report be made on the possible uses of Blockchain for the government, such as its potential for the verification of state records and the use of smart contracts. The real estate industry has already long been making use of Blockchain-protocols and tokenization. In the US, the Miami real estate industry has embraced cryptocurrencies, and property deals in New York and Lake Tahoe have taken place with Bitcoin transactions. Internationally, property in Dubai and Bali has sold for Bitcoin as well. Propy also previously launched a pilot program in August 2017 in Ukraine, partnering with the country’s Agency for E- Governance to allow foreign investors to purchase property in Ukraine.

Jungwirth said : The IOTA platform allows connected devices to digitally send money to each other in form of micropayments, making it useful for the IoT. While board additions are not often of particular note, the recent additions of both Jungwirth and Dr. Hongquan Jiang, Partner at Robert Bosch Venture Capital, represent growing mainstream interest in the IOTA Foundation’s ‘tangle’ technology. The company has recently been in the news for a misinterpreted partnership statement with Microsoft and others, and has seen its price rise and fall drastically over recent months, with highs over $5.50 before the end of last year. The coin is traded at around $2.40 as of press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At press time, IOTA was trading at $2.58, up 8.9 percent on the day.
cointelegraph	weiss-ratings-gives-bitcoin-c-sparks-south-korean-ddos-revenge	Weiss Ratings Gives Bitcoin C+, Sparks South Korean DD...	2018-01-25	 South Korean Bitcoin “ investors ” allegedly launched the DDoS attack that shut down Weiss Ratings’ website after the agency gave the cryptocurrency a ‘C+’ rating. According to a press release citing “ numerous mentions on social media ” about plans to attack Weiss, staff were “ up all night ” attempting to restore normal service after the release of ratings for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Thursday. “ Earlier commentary on social media expressed considerable fear we were about to release negative ratings on their preferred currencies,” founder Martin D. Weiss commented, “ so this may be an attempt to thwart our release today. ” No cryptocurrency managed to gather an ‘A’ on Weiss’ list, while the rating agency’s other conclusions also drew criticism from commentators. Bitcoin Cash fared only slightly worse than Bitcoin itself with C-, while Ethereum scored a B and Dogecoin C, placing it similarly just below Bitcoin in terms of providence. “ All else being equal, as a cryptocurrency overcomes its individual challenges, it's likely to be upgraded promptly,” Weiss himself nonetheless added adopting a somewhat more bullish tone. In the week of the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, legacy finance entities are delivering curious appraisals of cryptocurrency as it faces its most mainstream year yet. Former US Secretary of State John Kerry told Cointelegraph that crypto “has value” at the event, while JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon privately denied he was a “skeptic” when it came to Bitcoin.
cointelegraph	what-the-fud-bitcoin-market-beset-by-january-woes	What the FUD? Bitcoin Market Beset by January Woes	2018-01-25	 It has been a depressing fortnight for anybody reading various mainstream headlines touting the ‘end of Bitcoin’ and the arrival of the ‘crypto bubble’ crash. Unsurprisingly, the most recent cryptocurrency market slump has led to naysayers stepping onto their soapboxes, crying out messages of ‘I told you so’. Their rhetoric is not unfounded, given that the overall cryptocurrency markets have suffered two dramatic corrections in under a month, one just before Christmas and the most recent last week. So-called industry experts have been voicing their opinions in interviews with mainstream media, speculating on the burst crypto bubble without any real evidence to show that the markets are irreversibly damaged. What we know A wave of uncertainty in South Korea led to massive sell-off of cryptocurrencies last week, as traders unloaded amid fears of regulatory clamp downs from the government. Those fears were led by misleading reports of an all out cryptocurrency trading ban in a country which accounts for 20 percent of global trades. It is now understood that South Korea will only ban anonymous trading - meaning people wishing to trade cryptocurrencies need to do so through authorised exchanges using a registered bank account. Furthermore, foreigners and minors in the country are now prohibited from cryptocurrency trading, while the government will tax exchanges in line with existing policies. This was coupled with murmurs of further regulatory moves in China, which has already banned cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Unsurprisingly, the markets reacted as they would with any hint of bad news, which has led to bearish attitude. Banks, financial institutions still wary Financial service giant UBS is particularly bearish towards Bitcoin. Speaking at the World Economic forum this week, chairman Axel Weber said the company had advised clients to steer clear of investing in Bitcoin. In an interview with CNBC, Weber said: “Retail clients, who don’t fully understand these products, should be protected from going into these products, because if there is a retail client affected in the future, the question will be again who was the bank that sold them these products and then banks will be blamed again for what has happened.” Weber went on to say that the growing interest in cryptocurrencies around the world will inevitably lead to further regulation. Regulations, as he told Bloomberg in another interview, could lead to further market corrections. Earlier this week, Wall Street analyst Peter Boockvar suggested that Bitcoin could drop as low as $1000 in 2018. He also attributed the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies to their inflation-proof nature and scarcity. Governments hold the future of cryptos One theme that is becoming increasingly clear is that mainstream investment institutions are still worried about regulations crippling the future of cryptocurrencies. As Weber noted in his interview with Bloomberg, investors’ interest is always piqued by growth in value of any asset. He admits that cryptocurrencies have not gone unnoticed, but the uncertainty of their future is too risky for institutional investors to go in 100 percent. However, what goes unspoken by critics is that any positive moves by countries could bring about exponential growth and adoption of virtual currencies. This year undoubtedly holds a lot in store, and it seems far too early in the year for people to be writing off every single cryptocurrency.
cointelegraph	why-are-portuguese-increasingly-excited-about-cryptocurrency-trading-expert-blog	Why Are Portuguese Increasingly Excited About Cryptocu...	2018-01-28	 Portugal’s Central Bank Director Hélder Rosalino said that he didn't consider cryptocurrency a currency or legal tender and hinted that the Central Bank of Portugal has a similar position. His views are in line with many countries around the world, including the US where “ a cryptocurrency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.” The Finance Minister of Portugal Mario Centano, who is also the president of the Eurogroup, said last December that he is looking to European regulatory guidance concerning cryptocurrencies since they are "overseeing the general picture." The Eurogroup is a group of nineteen finance ministers of EU countries, who meet once a month to talk about major economic and monetary policies that are implemented across the EU. Finance ministers from France, Germany and the UK have proposed that cryptocurrency regulation should be coordinated at a global level with discussions taking center stage at the next upcoming G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Ripple effect on banking transactions As the Portuguese banking and finance regulators hint at and seek a coordinated regulatory solution for cryptocurrencies– their extreme price volatility with tsunami-like price fluctuations have Portuguese banks spooked, to no end. When in December 2017 Bitcoin’s price first surged 100 percent to $20,000 and then nose-dove 50 percent in value, bringing down the prices of all other cryptocurrencies in its wake, Banco Santander-Portugal, the fourth largest Portuguese bank, shuttered their customer’s cryptocurrency trading activity. As a backlash, more than 1,000 its customers signed a petition stating that the bank was deviating from the financial innovation trend and was ignoring the unhinged technological shift towards Blockchain technology all over the world. Some customers even went to file complaints with the DECO, country's consumer protection organization. Caving to customer pressure after admitting that the Santander Group began using Blockchain technology in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reduce costs and make cross-border payment transactions more efficient, Banco Santander-Portugal changed its policy about shutting down its customer’s cross-border cryptocurrency trades at foreign cryptocurrency exchanges like Luxembourg-based Bitstamp and US-based Coinbase. “We are committed to creating a leading international Blockchain payment ecosystem that presents significant opportunity for cross-border payments globally,” explained José Luis Calderón, the global head of Santander Global Transaction Banking. Banco Santander-UK began working with American Express and the Ripple network, to allow American Express' US business customers to make instant, traceable cross-border non-card payments using the Blockchain network – RippleNet – to Banco Santander-UK. “We’re taking a huge step forward with American Express and Santander to solve the problems customers experience with slow cross-border global payments,” Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple revealed. RippleNet provides optional access to Ripple (XRP), which as of Jan. 28, 2018, is the third largest by market capitalization cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable "secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks." It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. Currently, Ripple requires two parties for a transaction to occur: a regulated financial institution "holds funds and issues balances on behalf of customers" while "market makers" such as hedge funds or currency trading desks provide liquidity in the currency they want to trade in. In addition to Banco Santander, over 100 banks and payment networks have adopted RippleNet as a settlement infrastructure technology. No personal income taxation of cryptocurrency gains As Banco Santander-Portugal began restating its customers’ ability to trade cross-border on foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, more good news arrived. Personal income taxation does not apply to cryptocurrency gains in Portugal. “A recent binding ruling from the Portuguese tax administration says that gains from the sale of cryptocurrency are not taxed in Portugal unless the individual taxpayer carries on a business or professional activity and earns said income in that context (profit). The tax administration acknowledges that this sale is not taxable as personal income, particularly as capital income or capital gains. Thus, unless the individual taxpayer carries on an active trade or business concerning cryptocurrencies, income from the sale or purchase of cryptocurrency is not subject to tax in the context of the Personal Income Tax (PIT) code, Rogerio Fernandes Ferreira, the lead tax partner at international law firm Rogerio Fernandes Ferreira & Associados pointed out. Taxation may only take place when its regularity constitutes a business or professional activity for the taxpayer. “Portugal does not charge a “cross-border tax” in addition to or as an alternative to the personal income tax,” Ferreira added However, since Portuguese individual taxpayers may undertake cross-border cryptocurrency transactions on a foreign crypto exchange – they may be subject to cross-border taxes imposed by a foreign country that may be minimized or eliminated under an income tax treaty. Recently the EU Commission has prepared draft tax legislation on the digital economy, which calls for formulating an appropriate proposal, with cooperation with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other international partners. While the Portuguese consumer protection association DECO has appealed to the Ministry of Finance, and the European commissioner in charge of consumer defense, proposing that individual cryptocurrency gains in Portugal should be taxed in the same manner as stocks. DECO’s tax proposal has similarities to the method in which the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes cryptocurrency gains. The IRS characterizes cryptocurrencies as property. This means that every time a cryptocurrency is transferred, it might trigger a gain, subject to US taxation. A cryptocurrency held as a capital asset by a taxpayer would be taxed as capital gains. A cryptocurrency held as inventory or for resale by a taxpayer would be taxed as ordinary income. If it is used as a means of payment, it would be treated like a currency, converted to fiat at its fair market value as disclosed on a cryptocurrency exchange and taxed as ordinary income. Since cryptocurrencies are used in cross-border transactions, US sourced cryptocurrency gains of non-resident taxpayers would be subjected to a withholding tax that could be reduced or eliminated under an income tax treaty. For these purposes, the cryptocurrency-related income traded over the Internet would be determined under the international communications source rules. In summary, it can to be said that Portuguese individual taxpayers who are increasingly excited about trading cryptocurrencies cross-border on foreign cryptocurrency exchanges are urged to take into consideration the tax laws in all the jurisdictions they trade in and store their cryptocurrencies in secure foreign wallets to avoid hacking risks.

cointelegraph	worlds-first-cryptocurrency-airport-in-brisbane	World’s First Cryptocurrency Airport In Brisbane	2018-01-25	 Brisbane Airport (BNE) will soon become the first cryptocurrency airport terminal, according to reports from local media. The airport is working with local and international companies to make the entire terminal cryptocurrency friendly, with stores, coffee shops and restaurants accepting Bitcoin, Ether and Dash. The move to digital currencies makes sense for the airport, as the number of crypto investors increases. According to Roel Hellemons, the General Manager of Strategic Planning and Development: “Many people around the world have made money investing in cryptocurrencies and a lot of these people travel internationally, so it makes sense to offer a digital currency experience within our terminals.” The airport will partner with TravelbyBit, a cryptocurrency payment system, in order to allow travelers the ability to buy digitally. The move highlights Australia’s growing warmth toward cryptocurrencies and digital payment methods, in spite of negative perspectives from other countries. With the recent ban from China and the threats from South Korea, the openness of Australian policy will come as a welcome change for crypto investors.
cointelegraph	worlds-first-major-agricultural-trade-using-blockchain-completed-resounding-success	World’s First Major Agricultural Trade Using Blockchai...	2018-01-25	 The applications of Blockchain technology are potentially endless - and every year we are hearing more uses in business and trade. Cryptocurrencies remain in the limelight but that hasn’t stopped multinational companies from forging ahead with their own Blockchain solutions in an effort to streamline business. As it so happens, a new milestone has been reached by mainstream industries in 2018. In a first for the global agricultural industry, a cargo shipment of soybeans has been completed using Blockchain technology. The trade was carried out digitally using Easy Trading Connect (ETC) Blockchain platform, according to Reuters. ETC incorporated a number of contracts and certificates needed for the international trade of agricultural products. Deeper look The shipment from America to China involved five different parties including Louis Dreyfus Co, Shandong Bohi Industry Co, ING, Societe Generale and ABN Amro. The Louis Dreyfus Company, a multinational agricultural merchant, has hailed the use of Blockchain technology in trade due to its efficiency. The company’s head of trade operations, Robert Serpollet, estimated that the use of Blockchain to process the contracts and certificates greatly reduced the usual time it would take for a trade like this to be approved. “We noticed very significant efficiency gains far beyond what we expected.” Using the ETC platform, Bohi bought the shipment of soybeans from Louis Dreyfus - while various banks provided the credit certificates needed for the sale. The shipping companies took care of the necessary paperwork needed for the shipment and the US Department of Agriculture was involved in providing certificates for the sanitation requirements. Anthony van Vliet, who heads up ING’s trade and commodity finance, believes the use of Blockchain in this specific industry could well be widely adopted due to its cost-saving benefits. “This is key as we operate in a business that has high volumes and very low margins. If not months, then in a year or at max two, I think the world in this space will look quite different.” A new use-case Blockchain technology is mostly used as the backbone for transactions, like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, as Ethereum pioneered, it can be used in more technical ways, like the inclusion of contracts that can be carried out by the Blockchain. As this latest soybean use-case proves, a number of different parties can be involved in a complex business transaction. By using Blockchain technology, the process is sped up while becoming cheaper - which will no doubt be a draw for other businesses. Using a Blockchain platform also keeps all stakeholders involved and informed throughout the process.

MUFG is the largest financial company in Japan and is set to become the first Japanese bank to issue a virtual currency, Mainichi.jp reports. The bank had plans to develop a cryptocurrency as far back as 2016. According to Mainichi.jp, the launch date has now been finalized and is intended to take place in the FY 2018. Based on Blockchain technology, MUFG coin will allow users to conduct instant person-to-person transactions as well as shop with lower fees. MUFG stated the company will process all the transactions from its cryptocurrency’s network, claiming that such an approach will help improve the stability of the coin. The bank also plans to peg one MUFG coin to one Japanese yen in order to maintain people’s confidence in the new cryptocurrency. Another local company, the e-commerce giant DMM Group, launched its own 7-asset cryptocurrency exchange on Jan. 11, which highlights the growing level of Blockchain tech adoption in Japan. In contrast to the governments of neighboring China and South Korea, the Japanese government has adopted a more welcoming approach to regulating the cryptocurrency market, which has likely had a positive impact on the growth of the industry in the country.
