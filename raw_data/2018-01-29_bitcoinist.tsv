bitcoinist	12-year-old-virtual-currency-kids	12 Year Old 'Disrupts London' with Virtual Currency for Kids	2016-12-06T16:00	East London schoolboy, Ebenezer Odubanjo, presented VeeCee, an innovative online shopping platform for kids and young people, as part of the annual Disrupt 24 Hour Hackathon. Also read: ESMT BERLIN BECOMES FIRST GERMAN UNIVERSITY TO ACCEPT BITCOIN Kids Want Virtual Currency Too VeeCee empowers young people to curate their own buying choices by maintaining an online wish-list. It then provides parents a portal through which to make the purchases and gives them final say on whether items are appropriate. The platform enables young people to earn rewards from their guardians, peers and other adults, for chores and other tasks. These virtual currency (VeeCee) rewards can be used to make secure purchases from the online store, shared with friends, or saved towards wish-list items. A three-way authentication process requires two adults to approve a transaction before it is accepted. This gives parents more control over how the virtual currency is spent. Alternatively, an adult could directly buy a gift from a niece or nephew’s wish list, making the struggle of finding the right Christmas and birthday presents a thing of the past. The platform is also supporting TechFugees, enabling VeeCee donations to less privileged kids to get Christmas presents or school books from their wish list. Disrupt Bedtime The Disrupt Hackathon is a 24 Hour event preceding the annual Disrupt London conference organized by TechCrunch. Developers and engineers from around the world have just 24 hours to create and present a new product to a panel of expert judges. Being too young to stay overnight at the Hackathon, Ebenezer and fellow teammate Ashley Frempong, started to brainstorm ideas in the week before the event started. When the idea for VeeCee came about, “We got really hyped about it,” said Ebenezer. The boys built the service with the rest of their four-man team, who came together 6 months ago, over a shared love for coding in the back of a Barking library, a space called DigiLab and home of the community’s local tech center. The Future’s Bright The team intends to keep working on the project, aiming to further improve service flow and user experience. They are also looking at implementing blockchain technologies, to incorporate real crypto-currencies, smart contracts, and distributed systems. Some of the previous Hackathon entries have seen great success. GroupMe, for example, was created overnight in the competition, and ultimately acquired by Skype for $80m. So, with some help from DigiLab, the group are hoping to create a viable business. They plan a soft-launch with a small community to test and gather feedback. You can try out the service as it currently stands online here. Can VeeCee become a viable online shopping platform for kids? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of techcrunch.com
bitcoinist	2-3-billion-people-use-bitcoin-amazon	2.3 Billion People Can Now Use Bitcoin on Amazon	2017-01-24T07:00	Almost 2.3 Billion people can now shop on Amazon without a computer or a bank account following Purse.io’s Android app launch. Shopping with Bitcoin on Amazon Now Available to 2.3 Billion Following the launch of its iOS app, Purse.io has now released the Android version for its platform, enabling billions to shop on Amazon with Bitcoin on the most popular smartphone operating system with over 1.4 billion users globally. With b oth operating systems supported, the number of people globally that can now use this service is now around 2.3 billion and expected to reach 2.8 billion by 2020, according to Statista. Purse announced : We’re excited to formally announce the arrival of our official Purse Android app! We released our iOS app back in November […]. So, of course had to spread the love to the largest and most widely used mobile operating system in the world, Android. Although the online retail giant does not accept Bitcoin directly, Purse.io matches buyers with gift card holders creating an extremely powerful use-case: online shopping. Furthermore, it enables those who don’t have a bank account or credit card to use the Amazon e-commerce platform, even if they don’t have a computer. The service also lets merchants register their Purse account and sell directly on the platform. Needless to say, all items from Amazon that are purchased on Purse.io are cheaper than the ones listed on Amazon itself. Not only because of Bitcoin’s smaller transaction fees but also because it provides a gift card/bitcoin exchange market as well as significant discounts. How does Purse.io work? Sellers can create a free or paid account on Purse.io and list their items for sale. Once a purchase takes place, Purse.io will act as an escrow until the transaction is complete. The Purse system allows merchants and buyers (depending on the payment system) to save a lot on transaction and conversion fees. However, the most ingenious feature in Purse.io is its Amazon alternative. Purse.io matches shoppers buyers with gift card holders. Since gift cards are usually unredeemable, this creates an alternative for those that don’t want to use their gift cards. Then, the shopper can select a product he wants from Amazon, create a wishlist for it on Purse.io and name his discount or accept the one available. Gift card holders will then take the order and use the gift card to purchase the item. The gift card holder receives Bitcoin for the card he could not redeem previously and the buyer receives the item, creating a win-win environment. This means that if you have extra gift cards you don’t want, you can also take advantage of the Purse.io system to exchange them for Bitcoin at a discount. Bitcoin & Amazon Despite third-party services like Purse.io, Amazon still does not accept Bitcoin as a payment method. There are a few evident motives as to why Amazon has yet to integrate Bitcoin into its e-commerce platform, including volatility and the lack of refund options for Bitcoin. However, online retailers like Overstock.com and Newegg.com have demonstrated that Bitcoin can be used as a viable payment system, while OpenBazaar has even built a decentralized e-commerce platform that accepts only Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment. Some speculate that Amazon already has deals in place with major credit card companies, an advantage it would lose over smaller online retailers if they start dealing with Bitcoin. Another theory is that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos does not like Bitcoin due to his political views on the unregulated and anonymous nature of Bitcoin. In 2014, Amazon stated that it would not accept Bitcoin due to the lack of interest from customers, which it still could in the future if Bitcoin’s user-base grows. But if the e-commerce giant, which comprises about 15% of total U.S. consumer online sales, according to the company’s statements and the Department of Commerce, begins to accept it, then we can safely say that Bitcoin has finally become mainstream. Will Purse.io push adoption forward? Will Amazon ever add Bitcoin to its list of accepted payment systems? Share your thoughts below! Images courtesy of ShutterStock, amazon.com, Purse.io, Statista
bitcoinist	2017-is-over-what-does-2018-hold-for-bitcoin	As We Say Goodbye to 2017, What Does 2018 Hold for Bitcoin? - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-31T23:00	2017 is finally over. The value of Bitcoin has multiplied by 14, and this is the first year that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies made it into mainstream media. What’s next for Bitcoin in 2018? Price Explosion: A Brief Overview This year did not start out as a promising year for bitcoin. Right after returning to the $1000 mark on the first day of the year, China cracked down on multiple bitcoin exchanges; margin trading was banned, which caused the price to plummet back down to 70%. Unsurprisingly, nobody foresaw the growth that Bitcoin experienced over the following months. In the first half of the year, the price steadily rose to around $3000; but that was when the madness began. Over the next few weeks, the price skyrocketed; Bitcoin became a hot topic and it was being featured at least once a week on mainstream media. This frenzy continued up until mid-December when prices topped $20,000 on several exchanges. Many people in the Bitcoin community thought that this price rise was unsustainable, and a correction was long overdue, and they were right. The price steadily dropped back down over the course of a couple of weeks and has stabilized at the $13000-15000 range. 2017 was also the year where traditional investors started to invest in bitcoin. Although the Bitcoin ETF (COIN) filed by the Winklevoss Twins was rejected earlier in the year, it didn’t stop others from trying to bring Bitcoin into the traditional financial space. CME Group and CBOE Exchange launched Bitcoin Futures in December, which drew a lot of media attention and investor interest. What’s Next for Bitcoin in 2018? 2018 will certainly be an exciting year for Bitcoin, at least technology-wise; major advances have been made to the Lightning Network, the second layer which aims to scale bitcoin for the masses. The project is expected to be completed sometime next year, which would enable instant and nearly free transactions. Schnorr Signatures are also on the horizon, which would restructure signatures in bitcoin transactions to reduce transaction size and thus, fees. This doesn’t mean that the Bitcoin community can relax and underestimate other coins, however. Even though Bitcoin is the top cryptocurrency right now, there’s nothing stopping other coins from taking its place. Other cryptocurrencies are proving themselves to be serious competitors to Bitcoin – Bitcoin Cash offers far cheaper transactions, while Ethereum is proving itself to be a very powerful smart contract platform. Ethereum will also be hard-forking sometime in 2018 to switch to a Proof-of-Stake system. So… Moon or Not? The only right answer to this question is “maybe”. Nobody knows what will happen – maybe the price will stabilize, maybe we will see another 14x rise, or maybe it could collapse. Even though we cannot predict the future, some so-called “experts” think they do; here’s a list of predictions for 2018. Tomas Salles, FXStreet Analyst – $8,073 to $89,750 Nick Colas, DataStreet Research Co-Founder – $6,500 to $22,000 Dennis Gartman, The Gartman Letter Editor – Below $5,000 Dr. Julian Hosp, TenX Co-Founder – $5,000 to $60,000 What do you think about these predictions? Do you think they will be accurate given that in 2017 all predictions were blown out of the water? Let us know your thoughts below! Images courtesy of BitcoinWisdom, NASA, AdobeStock
bitcoinist	28012	Cheero Power Plus 3 External USB Battery Review - Bitcoinist.com	2016-01-06T03:07	The Cheero Power Plus 3 (PP3) is a standard lithium ion battery external power bank. It comes in a classic white that hasn’t managed to attract any scuffs despite regular use. Cheero is a Japanese company that is avidly penetrating many niche areas of the technology hardware industry. Bitcoinist.net will make sure to stop by Cheero’s stand at CES 2016 in our continued effort to expand our coverage. While we are traditionally a fintech, Bitcoinist.net is now bringing our world-renowned review skills to all hardware. Cheero Power Plus 3 Power Bank Hardware Specifications – 13400 mAh – DC 5v/2A Micro USB Input – DC 5V/1A and DC 5V/2.4A – ~500 usage times Cheero PP3 Power Bank Review As a frequent traveler, I often find myself needing to recharge my phone when I am attending Bitcoin meetups and Bitcoin conferences around the country. Having all the different Bitcoin wallet apps open to show new users the width and breadth of Bitcoin wallet functionality is very taxing on my battery. Given that my phone is a few generations old, even an extended battery case doesn’t keep it truly competitive. Without this power bank (and the other one I use to keep this one topped off), I’d be just a nomad instead of a digital nomad. The 3.8×3.1×0.9 inch body bulges slightly wider than other ~10000mAh external power banks. Importantly, the Cheero doesn’t charge your gear if you don’t push the power button. This is a feature not a bug. Pros: Two USB output ports Cons: Only comes in white The product is available on Amazon, but of course you should consider using Purse.io (Bitcoinist referral link) to save a few bits/bucks on Amazon instead and be able to pay in Bitcoin. It has 5 stars on Amazon and it gets 5 stars from us! Images from Juwan Li. Test unit provided by Cheero USA.

bitcoinist	3commas-smart-tools-intelligent-cryptocurrency-traders	3Commas - Smart Tools for Intelligent Cryptocurrency Traders - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-31T15:00	3Commas is a suite of “smart tools” to help cryptocurrency investors minimize risks, limit losses, grow profits, and manage their portfolios across multiple exchanges. Saint Petersburg, Russia-based 3Commas offers experienced and beginning traders alike a suite of “smart tools” designed to help them manage their portfolios across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges while maximizing profits and limiting losses. Before test-driving the platform, Bitcoinist sat down with 3Commas CMO Mike Goryunov to talk about what prompted the team to develop the platform in the first place: It’s kind of a funny story because we originally built this platform for our own use only. When we showed our project to friends in the crypto community, we saw a big need for the kinds of tools 3commas has and so we decided to open the project to everyone. 3Commas opened to the public in September 2017 and, primarily through word of mouth, has grown to over 5000 active traders and an average daily trade volume of over $5 million USD. Tools and Features The first thing that caught our attention about 3Commas was the clean, uncluttered interface. The platform offers a simple, logical user experience whether you are accessing it via a desktop computer or mobile device. Russian and English language options are available, as well, with additional languages in the works. Cryptocurrency exchange integrations 3Commas integrates with Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Binance, and any Ethereum wallet and the process of hooking up your exchange account to the platform is fast and simple thanks to easy-to-follow illustrated documentation. Additional exchanges will be added throughout the coming year. To minimize risk and to encourage smart trading habits, 3Commas has implemented two tools that every trader should learn to take advantage of – Trailing Stop Loss and Trailing Take Profit. Trailing Stop Loss A Trailing Stop Loss order is identical to a standard Stop Loss order in all respects except one. Both let you minimize your losses in the event of a price drop, but unlike a Stop Loss order that is set manually at a fixed price threshold, a Trailing Stop Loss order is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations. For example, let’s say you purchase 10 ETH at $675 each and to minimize any potential losses, you set a Stop Loss order of 10%. This means that if the price of ETH drops below $607.50, the stop loss order will automatically execute, selling your ETH at that price. But what if the price of ETH goes *up* during the day? A standard Stop Loss order will still only execute when the price drops below 10% of the original buy-in price. A Trailing Stop Loss order, however, automatically adjusts to the price change. So if the price of ETH goes up by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order would trigger when the adjusted price drops by 10%, netting you a 5% gain. Trailing Take Profit Just like how the Trailing Stop Loss tool is designed to minimize losses, the Trailing Take Profit tool is designed to maximize gains. Using our Ethereum example from above, let’s say you buy 10 ETH at $675 each and set a standard Take Profit order at $700. This means that you would make a profit of $25 per ETH. But what if ETH goes higher than $700? You’ve just lost additional potential profit. A Trailing Take Profit order lets you sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. So if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH climbs to $800 and then falls, the sell order would take effect when the price falls below $720 ($800 – 10% = $720), netting you a profit of $45 per ETH. Custom Portfolios 3Commas Portfolios tool is a unique feature that not only lets users track their actual portfolio’s performance over time, but also lets them create custom “dream portfolios” of tokens and coins that they think could be profitable. These custom portfolios are publicly available to other users who can analyze them and even add them to their own actual portfolio. The Road Ahead 2018 looks to be a very busy year for 3Commas. Several new trading tools will be added, including social trading and arbitrage trading. Social trading, which we are told will be rolled out sometime in February 2018, lets users ‘follow’ their favorite traders and copy their trades. Arbitrage trading will allow users to take advantage of price differences between one exchange and another. Essentially, traders will be able to buy low on one exchange and sell high on another. True crypto arbitrage trading capabilities are few and far between, so the launch of this tool, in particular, should be of great interest to the crypto community. For more information about 3Commas, or to try it out for yourself, visit 3commas.io. Ringing in the New Year with a 50% Bonus In true holiday spirit, and to usher in the new year in grand style, 3Commas are giving users a 50% bonus on all deposits from December 31, 2017, through January 3, 2018. No promo code is needed. Just sign up at 3Commas (or sign in if you’re already a registered user) and make your deposits. Bonuses will be credited automatically. Have you tried 3Commas yet? Which of their trading and portfolio management tools do you find to be the most useful? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of 3Commas, Shutterstock

bitcoinist	500k-early-adopters-participate-upcoming-polybius-project-ico	Over 500k Early Adopters to Participate in Upcoming Polybius Project ICO - Bitcoinist.com	2017-05-11T16:00	Estonia-based blockchain startup, Polybius Foundation has projected the participation of over 500,000 of its HashFlare cloud mining service users to take part in the upcoming crowdsale. These early adopters of Polybius Project are expected to help the platform achieve its funding targets during the ICO. [Note: This is a press release.] The Polybius ecosystem connects a ‘Digital Pass remote’ ID service, protected personal data storage, and financial services through Polybius Bank. Digital Pass is touted to replace the current standard of all-European electronic identity cards with a universal eID. The multi-regional Digital Pass will aim to offer a single digital database system for numerous sectors, including both health and education. The Polybius database could allow people with pre-existing conditions to have an option to make their details available to overseas practitioners, thus making the validation of medicine prescriptions much more achievable when abroad. This system could also prove crucial when a patient needs to receive vital medical services overseas. In such a scenario, doctors will be able to gain access to the person’s complete medical history and insurance information, with patient’s consent. The Polybius digital database would also relieve the need for students to prove their course attendance and enrolment details with physical paperwork. The Polybius Digital pass system is designed to empower the user to choose whether to allow or refuse access to their personal data as they see fit. The repository’s security level keeps personal information secure. Users of Polybius project will receive access to a universal digital repository containing their personal data over blockchain. Their respective database entries will be equivalent to standard identification document, acceptable by both state and commercial organizations. Polybius Foundation’s touted Polybius Bank will soon launch Digital Pass, which will be offered as an alternative electronic identity system to countries which don’t have a similar setup at the moment. The Polybius eID initiative is waiting to be officially recognized by all European Union nations under the eIDAS directive on or before July 23, 2017. Polybius ICO Polybius’ crowdfunding campaign, in the format of an ICO, will begin this quarter with a target to raise over $25 million to fund the initiative and other connected products. All campaign participants will be among the first to get a bank account with Polybius Bank, and they will be the first ones to receive their Digital Pass digital IDs. After the project’s launch, the service will be open to the public, and any questions regarding the project can be directed to the official Polybius Foundation Spokesperson, Edgar Bers at [email protected].
bitcoinist	53876-2	'Is Crypto Mining The Public?' Goldbugs Tell Media Gold Will Be Great Again	2018-01-01T15:00	Bearish mainstream finance figures have begun forecasting a consumer return to gold once Bitcoin “uncertainty” dents their confidence. Bitcoin ‘Uncertainty’ Will Prompt Gold Return In two separate interviews on pro-Bitcoin Cash news media network CNBC, Gartman Letter founder Dennis Gartman and gold mining CEO Sean Boyd both tipped the precious metal to ultimately benefit from Bitcoin fluctuations. Boyd noted: I think, over time, the question will be: are these cryptocurrencies and the developers of these cryptocurrencies just mining the public? […] Gold investors will come back when uncertainty creeps back into the market. His comments came following two appearances by Gartman on the network, during which he both championed gold’s appeal and rubbished Bitcoin, calling it “one of the silliest things I’ve ever heard.” On the network’s Futures Now segment, Gartman commented: When bitcoin falls, and it shall, it’ll trade under $5,000. […] Whether it does it next week, next year, six months from now, it’ll happen. And then I think we’ll find at the margin money that had moved into bitcoin and away from gold will move away from bitcoin and into gold. Bitcoin Prices Keep Dividing Gold industry sources had previously complained about the lack of interest from traders who had been “distracted” by Bitcoin, as one put it to Bloomberg in November. Aside from a separate narrative involving CNBC’s seemingly concerted efforts to warn consumers off Bitcoin in favor of Bitcoin Cash, negative outlooks on Bitcoin’s price came as the virtual currency came off all-time highs. A curious dichotomy has appeared on the topic of Bitcoin’s price expectations in 2018, with wildly optimistic forecasts from cryptocurrency advocates contrasting with continuing warnings of a bubble from mainstream sources. Bitcoinist reported various figures being entertained by the finance industry December 31, with spreads being noticeably wide. TenX co-founder Julian Hosp forecast anywhere between $5000 and $60,000, while FXStreet Analyst Tomas Salles guessed a more exacting $8,073 to $89,750.

bitcoinist	7-ways-criminals-steal-your-bitcoins	7 Ways Criminals Can Steal Your Bitcoins - Bitcoinist.com	2017-03-26T03:00	Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated. We have compiled a list of 7 ways criminals can steal your Bitcoins and how you can protect yourself from them. Top 7 Threats to You Bitcoin One of the defining aspects of Bitcoin is that it puts you in charge of your own finances. No one but you will dictate where you can spend your money or who to send it to. There is no censorship, there is only complete financial freedom. But freedom comes at a cost. If you lose your Bitcoins, send them somewhere by accident or if they’re stolen, there is no entity that will return them to you, they are lost for good. This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin has become a hub for all types of scams and cons. Cyber criminals are now becoming more sophisticated and finding new ways of stealing your hard-earned bits out from under your nose. Long-time users have seen their fair share of scams and are usually not drawn to them, but new users may be easily fooled by the prospect of making an easy profit. This is a huge problem for Bitcoin. Although variations of the same scams also exist with national currencies, these have a certain trust factor that is provided by the government that issues them. No one will stop using a national currency like the US Dollar just because they were scammed out of their dollars. With Bitcoin, however, users may feel like the fault is in the network and distance themselves from it. Bitcoinist has compiled a list of the most common methods cybercriminals use to steal your Bitcoins. If you’re getting started with Bitcoin, then this article may save you some money and heartache. Ransomware We’re going to start off with what can be considered one of the most profitable practices for cyber criminals, ransomware. Ransomware is not new, but Bitcoin has made it popular among hackers due to its efficiency as a decentralized payment system. So, what is Ransomware? Ransomware is basically a virus that will encrypt all (or part of) your files. The program will then give you the option of paying a certain amount of money in order for the files to be decrypted. This type of malware has become highly popular due to its effectiveness and could even leave Vegas with you. Hackers will usually target companies or organizations that cannot afford to be unavailable to their customers, ensuring a high success rate for the cyber criminals. However, anyone can fall victim to ransomware and individual users may be more vulnerable to them as they will often lack the tools or knowledge to try to decrypt their files on their own. Remember to always backup your important files and not to open or download any suspicious file. Having a good antivirus program in place is also advised. Fake Wallets This method is much less popular but has successfully scammed unknowing users out of their coins. Fake wallets are basically apps that initially look like a real wallet until it has the chance to steal your coins. These fake wallets are usually endorsed as being another legitimate wallet, often using the real wallet’s logo and name to fool users. They are basically like phishing (which we’ll also talk about) for wallets instead of websites or emails. Some fake wallets have even appeared on Apple’s App Store after successfully slipping through its vetting process. These misleading apps give both the real wallet and Bitcoin itself a bad name. Users can avoid this by downloading only from trustworthy sources like the wallet’s website and by confirming the name of the apps closely before downloading them. If you’re unsure, you can always ask the community on Reddit, Bitcointalk, and so forth. Bitcoin Phishing Phishing is basically a means of extracting sensitive information from victims. There are variations to the scheme but the most common ones are e-mails and fake websites. Scammers will try to trick the victim into giving them sensitive information regarding their Bitcoins like login details from an exchange or online wallet. They will often do this by sending an email from an email address that looks official or by buying a domain name that is almost identical to the real website. An example of this would be the fake blocklchain[.]info. Ponzi Schemes Yes, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are riddled with popular Ponzi schemes also known as pyramid schemes. These involve getting people to invest money and inviting more people to invest money, thus creating the pyramid effect. The new money is used to repay old investments and “the wheel keeps turning” until it can turn no more. At a certain point, the scammers will walk away with everyone’s money. The best time to leave is usually accessed by the amount of money that the cybercriminals are currently holding and by the reputation the website has earned so far. These schemes come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one thing in common, they want your coins and promise high returns for them. Two of the most popular disguises for these schemes are cloud mining websites that offer unrealistic returns and websites that claim to be employing some sort of automated trading algorithm to earn money on every trade. To avoid being tricked by these, simply stay away from websites that seem to have unrealistic returns like 1% per day or 100% per month and so on. Avoid any vague business model that doesn’t really explain how the company makes profit and only trust websites after doing intensive research. There are ways of earning interest on your bitcoin like margin or p2p loans, but these will never yield as much as promised by pyramid schemes. Fake Cryptocurrencies There are some scams like this out there, the most famous of which is Onecoin. This scheme works by convincing victims that they are buying units of a successful cryptocurrency when they are in fact just paying for numbers to show up on a website. There is no actual Onecoin blockchain or network of miners. Fake cryptocurrency schemes will often sell coins in the form of educational packages or mining spots and they will also offer nonsensical promotions like splitting coins to double them. Although it sounds ridiculous, many users have fallen victim to this scam and some have lost entire life savings to it. If you’re looking for a cryptocurrency to invest in, choose wisely and don’t be swayed with “developers” that promise the price of the coin will increase x times. A good rule to avoid these scams is to check if the coin exists on comparison websites like CryptoCompare or Coinmarketcap. Scam ICOs ICO, short for Initial Coin Offering, is a type of crowdfunding mechanism that is becoming increasingly popular within the blockchain space. The team behind a certain project will launch an ICO to sell tokens related to their project in exchange for Bitcoin, fiat or other cryptocurrencies. These tokens are usually equity based or they act like fuel to the platform, like Ether in the Ethereum platform. Given the momentum that ICOs currently have, it’s no wonder that some cyber criminals are trying to trick investors with fake projects. Scam ICOs can be hosted by scam artists with no more than a convincing logo, website, fictional team and a few other tricks. Often times, the “company” will be able to gather considerable amounts of BTC without an actual product or nothing more than vaporware. A perfect example would be DeClouds, a scam that managed to steal 300 Bitcoins from unknowing investors who though they were investing in a cryptocurrency backed by precious metals. Avoiding scam ICOs can be tricky and there are several things to look out for – Check out this guide on how to avoid scam ICOs. Scammers on P2p Exchanges These scams take place on peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins and Paxful and they basically consist of people trying to rip you off during a currency exchange. These p2p exchanges allow users to trade coins directly between themselves using an external payment system like cash deposit, PayPal, credit cards and others. Unlike Bitcoin, these payment methods usually allow the user to dispute a transaction for various reasons. Scammers will often use these markets to cash out hacked PayPal accounts or stolen credit cards in these markets. Some users will even use their real accounts but since most payment systems don’t offer seller protection for digital items, there isn’t much you can do in case of a chargeback. This has created a market, where some users will sell Bitcoin for a considerable premium. However, users that do this have experience with these scams and have methods for verifying the buyer’s identity and so on. To avoid this, only sell Bitcoin to established p2p traders and try to stay clear of chargeback-enabled payment methods like PayPal and Skrill. Remember that only those who control their private keys control their bitcoin. For a comprehensive list of fraudulent Bitcoin-related website, you can check out the Bad List here.

bitcoinist	abyss-aims-conduct-worlds-first-daico-new-protection-mechanism-ico-contributors-raised-vitalik-buterin	The Abyss Aims to Conduct the World’s First DAICO, A New Protection Mechanism for ICO Contributors, Raised By Vitalik Buterin - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-21T15:00	The Abyss is a next-generation digital distribution platform with the vision to create a crypto reward ecosystem for millions of gamers and developers. January 11, 2018 — The Abyss, the next generation digital distribution game platform, today announced the intent to launch a pioneering DAICO, a reinforced version of ICO merged with aspects of Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO). The DAICO fundraising model was proposed by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, earlier this month as a more responsible way to conduct initial coin offerings. The Abyss DAICO is scheduled on February 7, 2018. Founder of The Abyss platform, Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky said, “DAICO provides tangible solutions to the ever-changing security needs and puts transparency at the center of innovation. We are confident in our capability to implement and improve Buterin’s idea. Our DAICO will be the perfect bridge between fundraising and team motivations control.” The DAICO model will allow for refunds and raised funds withdrawal control by contributors. By design, DAICO minimizes the risk of fraud, specifies contribution and resolution rules, provides an option to shut the project down (in case the team fails to implement it), and excludes various kinds of attacks on the voting process. In turn, The Abyss offers an improved voting system with Oracles acting as arbitrators when it comes to the project closure and funds withdrawal. To provide an appropriate degree of expertise, Oracles could be appointed from industry professionals, with an established reputation in the relevant field, and would have the right to hold polls for projects shut down, leading to the remaining funds returned to contributors. Boyko-Romanovsky added: DAICO is a new mechanism, and there should be ways to further strengthen it while maintaining flexibility, transparency, and security. Oracles and exclusive voting rules will do the job efficiently and reliably. Only project’s contributors will be granted a voting right. Controlled by the Smart Contract, the Company’s and Reserve tokens will not be eligible to participate with. We will utilize the proof-of-stake algorithm during the polls, but to make it impossible for the exchanges to take part, the weight of each Ethereum-wallet’s vote will be limited by a certain amount of tokens.

Destiny.Games performs full-cycle development, publishes both their own and third-party MMO games including AAA-games. The company’s portfolio includes successful titles such as TERA: The Next, Botva Online, Music Wars, Moswar, and more. Images courtesy of The Abyss
bitcoinist	airbitz-blockchain-identity-management	Blockchain-Based Identity Management Will Soon Be a Reality - Bitcoinist.com	2017-05-16T06:00	Airbitz has partnered with Sphre to secure their Blockchain-Based Identity Management Platform, AIR. Airbitz Partners with Blockchain-Based Identity Firm Sphre, a blockchain-based identity management firm, announced their partnership with Airbitz, one of the most popular mobile Bitcoin wallets and a data security platform with over 140,000 users. Airbitz has been working on its Edge Security Platform since the company’s inception, focusing on providing a secure and easy-to-use solution for decentralized blockchain projects and dApps as a means enhance cryptocurrency mass adoption. Announced today, the partnership will see Sphre leverage Airbitz’ Edge Security, a blockchain-agnostic and zero-knowledge single sign-on solution, to secure their smart contract-based platform, AIR. Daren Seymour, Director at Sphre commented on the new partnership: The easy and intuitive user experience, coupled with rich functionality, great development environment and team made Airbitz an easy choice when considering the right partner for Sphre. We look forward to delivering an easy-to-use product to the market, and our partnership with Airbitz is a key component on this journey. AIR is digital identity and individual microeconomic engagement system based on blockchain infrastructure, allowing individuals, enterprises, and organizations to manage their digital identity through a single, decentralized application, thus retaining full control and ownership of said identity, which would not be possible in a centralized setting. The AIR whitepaper reads: In an interconnected, open digital world it does not make sense that digital identity is still fragmented in outdated, closed systems. The AIR Platform is build upon the Hyperledger blockchain and is comprised of two major components: The Chaincode or ‘smart contract’, which forms the basis of the given identity, and the Application Programming Interface (API), which will allow third-party organizations and enterprises to integrate support for AIR into their existing and new systems, while the mobile application secures and maintains each individual’s private key. The AIR Platform & XID tokens Currently in development, the AIR Platform will soon host a crowdfunding campaign to fund the development, marketing, and management of the AIR project. During the crowdfunding campaign or ICO, participants will receive XID tokens, which are used within the Air platform to facilitate identity-based transactions and handle profit-sharing disbursement based on the customizable monetization agreements that users can engage in. The XID token is to be issued on the Bitcoin blockchain through the Omnilayer platform that allows the distribution of digital identity monetization benefits to be handled through a decentralized mechanism, which is far more transparent and reliable than traditional alternatives. Due to the use of Omnilayer, AIR will not only allow any given user or organization to “authenticate/authorize themselves against their registration”, but also to attest/verify the identity of an account with whom they have successfully transacted, based on information found on the Bitcoin, the safest and oldest blockchain in the world. Can blockchain technology become the new security standard for individual and enterprise digital identity? Let us know in the comment section. Images courtesy of Shutterstock
bitcoinist	alleged-suspicious-activities-lead-suspension-top-indian-exchanges	Alleged Suspicious Activities Lead to the Suspension of Top Indian Exchanges - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-22T21:30	Even though India is straddling the regulation fence when it comes to cryptocurrencies, the country’s major banks have taken the decision to temporarily close the accounts of a few of India’s top Bitcoin exchanges. According to the Economic Times, The State Bank of India, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank are a few of the financial institutions that have provisionally shut down accounts of some top-performing exchanges. Anonymous sources have said that the closure is based on the fact that the exchange accounts were being used for a different reason than for what they were initially opened for. It has previously been reported that even though India has not banned cryptocurrencies, the government has been attempting to regulate exchanges. Possible Suspicious Activity Suspicious Transaction Reports need to be filed with the Financial Intelligence Unit by banks if anything out of the ordinary comes up on the accounts of the exchanges. A banker who prefers to remain anonymous said: We have asked some of these companies to explain the businesses that they are involved in and why it was not specified when opening the accounts. We will also be flagging some of these suspicious transactions with the concerned agencies. Extensive and Expensive Guarantees on Lending In addition to the closures, the banks are seeking more collateral on loans, and have also banned cash withdrawals from some exchanges. A source said: Since last month, banks have been asking for additional collateral with 1:1 ratio. Sources have said that 10 exchanges have been targeted including Unocoin, Zebpay, CoinSecure, and BtcxIndia. The latter three, and most of the banks, have not responded to the suspension claims. An emailed response from Sathvik Vishwanath, a promoter of Unocoin, to Economic Times stated: The banks have not contacted the company or the promoters regarding the actions you have mentioned. In addition, an anonymous banker involved has said: Reserve Bank of India has not issued any directive to us, it’s a cautionary move on our part. We are wary about the purpose for which some of these current accounts are being used. The Lucrative Business of Crypto Tax Authorities have also been looking into the tax implications of these exchanges, of which the top 10 could account for as much as $6 billion. A tax official who is part of a team looking into possibly applying a sales tax on Bitcoin exchanges had this to say: These exchanges tend to show the total volumes both on buy and sell side as their revenue. In many instances, the exchanges themselves buy and sell cryptocurrencies on their own platform. A suspension of accounts will result in an inevitable cashflow issue for these exchanges, leading promoters to even offer their personal property as collateral. Even so, an investment banker has said that these platforms produce high revenue and strong margins. He did, however, add: We would not like to invest till the taxation part is clarified. As in most countries, tax processes on cryptocurrencies still remain unclear in India. Even so, two exchanges have already asked the Authority for Advance Rulings to determine if exchanges are required to pay goods and services tax (GST). What do you think of these alleged temporary suspensions? Do you think exchanges in India should be subjected to tax deductions? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	an-exclusive-interview-with-bitplay-club	An Exclusive Interview with Blockchain-Based Lottery BitPlay Club - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-22T14:00	Feeling lucky? We certainly were when Bitcoinist had the opportunity to sit down with the team behind the hot new blockchain-based international lottery, BitPlay.Club. The crypto community is abuzz about BitPlay.Club, the new blockchain-based lottery players are flocking to in droves, thanks to an easy to use interface, better odds than many traditional lotteries, and an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability. Bitcoinist sat down with the platform’s team to learn more about what makes BitPlay.Club tick. Bitcoinist: What made you decide to launch a blockchain-based Bitcoin lottery? BP: When blockchain broke onto the scene, it began improving each and every area it touched. We saw the potential of this technology and we believed in it. Moreover, people are excited about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. We are a young team but we are not a start-up, we made some successful projects before and a few years ago we came up with the idea of creating the bitcoin-based lottery with the draws based on blockchain, so people could trust it. It took quite a while to start working on our idea and turn it into a reality, but here we are – Bitplay Club is ready to go public! Bitcoinist: What is your team’s experience in the blockchain and online gaming space? BP: Some of our team members have worked for online casinos in the past. Those casinos didn’t have provably fair algorithms, and nobody understands more than we do how important it is to show people transparent results and prove that they can trust your service because that was one of the most common questions from the casino customers. Bitcoinist: What makes Bitplay Club different from other Bitcoin lotteries? BP: Well, that’s a good question. You know, everybody has their own preferences when it comes to what appeals to them. Websites, services, and Bitcoin lotteries are no exception. Some people prefer one website design more than others, or find Service A easier to use than Service B. Some customers of ours prefer better Jackpot odds. Our jackpot is constantly growing and we are serious about leading a large part of the gambling market with new game releases, jackpot growth, and constant platform improvements. Bitcoinist: What payment methods do you currently accept? BP: We accept only Bitcoin payments at the moment, but we’re working on a currency exchange service that will be live soon. It will allow our customers to exchange different altcoins for BTC, which will be added to their Bitplay Club account balance. Everything is integrated so people don’t need to leave our website. Also, we will be adding Visa and Mastercard payments integration in about a month or so. Bitcoinist: What is a 6-45 lottery? BP: 6-45 lottery is a classic lottery where you need to pick 6 numbers out of 45 and wait for the results of the draw which is held once a day. We have improved on the 6-45 game, however, by adding a System Game feature where players can pick additional numbers and the system will generate all possible 6-number combinations from all the numbers that you’ve chosen. Also, users can choose to participate in a specified number of consecutive draws with the same ticket. Jackpot odds for this game are 1:8145060. Let’s call it our flagman, it’s simple, it has a nice jackpot which will be growing and it has nice jackpot odds compared to Powerball, for example. Bitcoinist: Do you have a referral program? BP: Of course, we give out 5% of each ticket sold to our referral partners plus we will be implementing additional features like free tickets for referring a certain number of clients. Bitcoinist: How is the jackpot amount determined? BP: So, for the 6-45 lottery we take 60% of each ticket sold for the prize pool increase while 30% of that 60% amount goes to jackpot increase and the rest goes to payout groups, depending on the quantity of number that you’ve guessed. Bitcoinist: Do you have any promotions or special offers at the moment? BP: We don’t have any yet but we are working on a new feature implementation – free tickets. We need to make some changes in the system prior releasing this feature but basically, people will be able to get free tickets on top of buying a certain number of tickets…everybody likes free stuff :) Bitcoinist: What future plans does Bitplay Club have? BP: We will be releasing at least two more games in the near future to meet the needs and preferences of all customers because some people prefer playing and winning anytime they can and not to wait for the results of a one draw per day. In the long term, we’ll be working hard on improving and marketing our platform so more people can enjoy playing an online lottery that is always fair and never rigged. Ready to try your luck? Head on over to BitPlay.Club to get started. You can’t win if you don’t play! Do you play the lottery? Have you played the lottery at BitPlay.Club?

bitcoinist	arsenal-fc-just-announced-sponsorship-deal-cashbet	Arsenal FC Just Announced A Sponsorship Deal With CashBet - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-24T22:30	CashBet is trying to raise the profile of its ICO through a sponsorship deal with Arsenal FC. News hit press out of the UK this week that Arsenal Football Club has signed an agreement with a blockchain technology company. An Alternative Route To ICO Promotion The company in question is CashBet, which is gearing up towards an initial coin offering (ICO) that is set up to raise the funds that the company requires to develop the “only mobile-first platform for real-money, social, and skill-based interactive gaming.” The deal will see the club promote the company by way of a sponsorship arrangement. As far as specific details of the sponsorship (and, indeed, what the promotion will entail) are concerned, things are pretty murky. In a recent article in The Guardian, three Arsenal players are seen holding a shirt with CashBet printed on the back and a BBC report, available here, suggests that Arsenal FC will promote CashBet (and, specifically, the upcoming CashBet ICO) and the club’s home games. The implications of this for the wider cryptocurrency space and the ICO space are mixed. Sure, it’s great to see a cryptocurrency picking up some mainstream attention and for CashBet there’s no doubt that the sponsorship will translate to some increased speculative attention surrounding its offering. That’s why companies sponsor a club, after all. CashBet Coin Token Sale https://t.co/cPurI968jM https://t.co/2XtGYTBwvg — jahrastar (@jahrastar_ivxx) January 24, 2018 The Risk Side Of The Coin On the other side of the equation, however, the ICO space remains bogged down by fraudulent activity and it’s incredibly difficult to ascertain the chances of success for a company that’s conducting an offering, especially for an unsophisticated participant, based on a company’s website and white paper. Right now, the success of an ICO (and we’re talking specifically about the ICO here, so success is measured in the hitting or otherwise of its hard cap), seems to be dictated by the marketing budget as opposed to the quality of the company and the development of the product or service for which the funds are being raised. Time will tell whether this move will prove smart for Arsenal, and CashBet, or not. Of course, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a football club attract sponsorship from a cryptocurrency. Jetcoin sponsored Serie A football team, A.C. ChievoVerona back in 2014 in an attempt to raise its profile in the sector. Jetcoin conducted its own ICO back in mid-2017 and currently trades for just 25% of its then-pricing. What do you think about this sponsorship? Is it a risky move for Arsenal? Let us know below!

bitcoinist	asian-companies-are-one-of-the-winners-from-the-current-bitcoin-rally	How Asian Companies are Benefiting From the Current Bitcoin Rally - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-30T01:00	Speculators and cryptocurrency traders might not be the only ones that are benefiting from the current Bitcoin rally. Many stocks of Asian companies have rapidly risen today, as Bitcoin managed to hit a new all-time high. Asian Company Stocks are Rallying The whole financial and technology world is watching today, as the popular decentralized cryptocurrency Bitcoin managed, for the first time to reach the astonishing price of $11,517 and a total market cap valuation of over $176 billion. Ethereum, another cryptocurrency that has also rapidly risen in the last couple of days, reached a new all-time high price of $522 and a total valuation of over $45 billion on Wednesday. In contrast, the total cryptocurrency market has currently reached the valuation of over $309 billion. Cryptocurrency traders and investors aren’t the only ones that are excited by this rally. Asian technology stocks have also risen in the last couple of months. The main reason behind that is the current boom of the cryptocurrency mining market. Stocks of Asian chip manufacturers have rapidly grown in the anticipation that future demand for cryptocurrency mining equipment would rise. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd is one of the Asian companies that has seen its stock prices rise over the last couple of weeks. The Upcoming Rise of Cryptocurrency Mining As the current cryptocurrency market is astronomically expanding, many experts predict an enormous rise in demand for more and better mining equipment. In a recent article by Bloomberg, a semiconductor analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Mark Li, described the current situation: There’s an arms race. The technology used is pretty intensive and you need very speedy chips to be able to mine the coin in the system. The article also reports that several Asian companies are planning to start their own cryptocurrency mining operations. One of these companies is the Japanese GMO Internet Inc. which is planning to deploy its mining farm in 2018 with seven-nanometer chips. It is definitely exciting to see that more and more companies are trying to get into Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency mining business. What are your thoughts on the rise of Asian company stocks? Do you think that Bitcoin was the main cause behind that? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay, Reuters/Issei Kato
bitcoinist	australians-can-pay-bills-with-bitcoin	24 Million Australians can now pay their bills with Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2017-05-08T16:00	As Bitcoin grows in popularity, more use cases for the cryptocurrency pop up every day. This time, an Australia-based startup has created a service that allows citizens in the country to pay their household bills with Bitcoin. Paying Bills with Bitcoin Dubbed the Living Room of Satoshi, the Australian startup allows users to pay their bills with Bitcoin by entering the details of the payment, choosing a payment system (bank account or BPay ) and sending their coins to the BTC address shown. Yesterday Living Room of Satoshi tweeted: We’ve processed over $5 million worth of real world bills, paid in Bitcoin at Living Room of Satoshi https://t.co/LdcNR63BB5 — LivingRoomOfSatoshi (@roomofsatoshi) May 8, 2017 The Living Room of Satoshi’s new service supports payment for any type of utilities like telecommunications, electricity, gas, school fees, water and credit cards. What’s more is that the company charges no extra fees for the BTC payments. The service also features a point system, where every $1 spent in bills awards users with 1 point that can be turned into gifts. Daniel Alexiuc, CEO of the Living Room of Satoshi said in an interview : As the first truly international, decentralised and peer to peer currency, Bitcoin is perfectly suited to bill payments in Australia,” he said. “It also enables new possibilities, like parents in foreign countries being able to easily support their children studying in Australia by paying some of their bills. Bitcoin in Australia Australia is generally thought of as a Bitcoin-friendly place. However, the country does have a double-tax issue where the cryptocurrency is considered barter and not money, which means that companies must pay both a tax when receiving cryptocurrencies as a payment and a goods-and-services tax (GST) when selling them for fiat. However, the Australian government announced plans to solve this issue in March last year Now, according to a statement released last week, the government is working with the FinTech Advisory Group to solve the double taxation problem. The statement reads: The Government agrees that consumers should not be subject to the GST twice when using digital currency to purchase goods or services. For this reason, the Government has already committed, through its Backing Australian FinTech statement, released on 21 March 2016, to address the ‘double taxation’ of digital currencies. Other than the absurd double taxation problem which is being taken care of, Bitcoin seems to have a bright future ahead in Australia. The $AUD currently ranks 12th on Bitcoin’s daily trading volume with multiple BTC exchanges and Bitcoin ATMs providing services in the country. Electricity is also cheap, allowing citizens to access Bitcoin through mining. Not only is Bitcoin easily accessible and popular among the country’s citizen, Australia’s Central Bank has also taken a notice to Bitcoin’s underlying technology, the Blockchain. The bank published a report dubbed Developments in the Financial System Architecture. It reads: One aspect of fintech that has been examined closely is the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), often referred to as ‘blockchain’ technology. The Bank is participating in a working group of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures examining DLT and its implications. In February, the working group published an analytical framework for authorities wishing to review and analyse the use of this technology for payments, clearing and settlement. What can you do with Bitcoin? Bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular and as more people start working with it, new and exciting use cases and services for the cryptocurrency arise. What was once a “worthless” internet currency can now be used to pay for goods and services across the world, allowing merchants to save money on credit card fees and more. So, what can you do with Bitcoin? The use cases are extensive: You can buy houses, boats, cars. You can rent a hotel room with Expedia or an apartment, buy millions of items from OverStock, buy gift cards, pay your electricity bills in Japan, pay your college tuition in multiple countries (including Australia). You can even get a Bitcoin IRA, get a Bitcoin loan, and buy and sell gold with BTC on the Vaultoro exchange. There’s a lot we can do with Bitcoin nowadays. So much that we are currently running at full capacity. With the infrastructure in place, now all Bitcoin needs in order to continue to grow is the ability to do so in terms of scalability. Will we continue to see interesting use cases for Bitcoin, like the one discussed here, show up with time? Can the scaling issues in Bitcoin, stop its infrastructure’s progress?

bitcoinist	australias-policymakers-made-country-attractive-ico-region	Australia's Policymakers Have Made The Country An Attractive ICO Region - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T19:00	The InvestDigital ICO illustrates how Australia has become one of the leading ICO targets for tech startups. When the Chinese government slapped a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017, the cryptocurrency space took a dive on expectations that similar regulatory action would follow from policymakers in other global regions. As it turned out, these expectations were misplaced. While we’ve seen certain government actions seek to impose some degree of regulation onto the ICO space, the overarching trend has been one of embrace, as opposed to rejection. InvestDigital ICO One nation that is benefiting from this relative-willingness-to-adopt approach is Australia – as illustrated by the end 2017 InvestDigital ICO. Between Christmas and New Year 2017, InvestDigital, a Chinese startup that’s looking to build and commercialize a funds management platform for cryptocoin-type assets, raised $23 million by issuing Ether through its ICO, with big names like InBlockchain, Bixin and Queschain Capital counted among the company’s backers. Last year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued guidance on these sorts of offerings and, in line with its seeming willingness to embrace this nascent industry, the guidance was favorable and positioned Australia as a highly competitive option for companies considering regions in which to conduct offerings of this type. And that’s what played into InvestDigital’s decision. Here’s what Bill Fuggle, a partner at Baker McKenzie Australia acted as legal counsel for InvestDigital leading into and during the company’s offering, had to say about the decision: The Australian position is not materially different from other sophisticated Western/Asian countries including Japan, Switzerland, the UK and the USA, however, Australian regulators are particularly well informed in relation to cryptocurrencies and seems to have put more resources into understanding this sector than others. Striking A Regulatory Balance How this space will change going forward is unclear, but it’s safe to say that the more accommodative regions are going to be the ones that attract the most ICO activity. This, of course, can be a plus and a minus. If the region in question can stay on top of the darker side of the industry through regulation but, at the same time, can balance its approach to maintain an accommodative environment, there’s plenty of benefit to be drawn from attracting blockchain-type companies to a national economy. If, however, policymakers in a region are unable to keep on top of the potential for fraudulent activity and malicious operation in their respective ICO markets, the benefits of attracting top tech companies could quickly negate. What do you think of the current Australian ICO regulations? Can the country become a top-tier target for ICOs? Let us know below! Image courtesy of Marko Mikkonen /Flickr
bitcoinist	bank-england-not-planning-issue-uk-state-cryptocurrency	Bank Of England: We're 'Not Planning' To Issue A UK State Cryptocurrency	2018-01-08T13:00	The UK’s central bank, the Bank of England (BoE), has confirmed it is “not planning” to adopt a state-sponsored cryptocurrency. Understanding ‘Implications’ In new updates to its official position on the cryptocurrency phenomenon last week, the BoE instead announced it was favoring research into the concept in order to understand its “implications.” An increasingly active presence in Blockchain, the BoE has already produced a fintech accelerator scheme which will additionally inform its ongoing research in the field. The UK has received criticism in recent months over its inability to keep up with the pace of consumer behavior regarding investment and taxation of crypto-assets and associated profits. Despite “first raising” the idea of a bank-issued centralized cryptocurrency almost two years ago, the BoE continues to opt for a similarly laid-back approach to that particular aspect of technology. The Bank of England confirms: We do not currently plan to issue a central bank-issued digital currency. However, we are undertaking research to better understand the implications of a central bank, like the Bank of England, issuing a digital currency… …We have since released a more detailed selection of research questions on the topic. We welcome continued engagement from the wider central banking and academic community to shape our research in this emerging field. BoE Suggests Cool Reception To New State Cryptos Internationally, a few select jurisdictions have signed up wholeheartedly to the idea of a centrally-controlled cryptographic version of their national currency. Russia’s so-called CryptoRuble is already at an advanced stage, while crisis-hit Venezuela announced just last week it would seek to issue 100 million units of its own Petro cryptocurrency allegedly worth almost $6 billion. Hinting at its opinion on the moves, the BoE appeared to warn about potential turbulent effects on the economy. It continues: If a central bank were to issue a digital currency everyone, including businesses, households and financial institutions other than banks, could store value and make payments in electronic central bank money in addition to being able to pay with cash. While this may seem like a small change, it could have wide-ranging implications for monetary policy and financial stability.

bitcoinist	barry-silbert-speak-inside-bitcoins-new-york	Barry Silbert to Speak at Inside Bitcoins New York - Bitcoinist.com	2015-04-25T15:00	Inside Bitcoins New York will host Barry Silbert as a speaker on Day 3 of the event in a moderated “Fireside Chat”. Barry Silbert will discuss bitcoin investing, and the latest trends, changes, technologies, and companies currently shaping bitcoin. Also Read: Inside Bitcoins New York: Sarah Martin to Speak on Day 3 Barry Silbert: Bitcoin Pioneer Barry Silbert has been a key leader in the rising bitcoin industry, even being selected in Fortune’s “ 40 under 40 ” in 2011, and this year has been named Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young and Crain’s. He is most respected for his founding of the Digital Currency Group, SecondMarket, and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT)- the world’s first publicly traded bitcoin fund. Today Barry Silbert’s primary focus is on his company, Digital Currency Group which he created to build the foundation for the digital currency revolution. Digital Currency Group builds and invests in bitcoin companies and is one of the top most influential bitcoin companies in the bitcoin arena. Through his personal investment vehicle, Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, Barry has also invested in over 40 bitcoin-related companies, including BitGo, BitPay, BitPagos, BitPesa, Chain, Circle, Coinbase, Gyft, Kraken, Ripple Labs, TradeBlock, Unocoin and Xapo. Barry’s Chat: The Currency Still Matters: Why “Hoarding” Bitcoin is Key to its Success. The “Fireside Chat” will be moderated by Marc Hochstein, Editor in Chief of American Banker. Barry Silbert will discuss the relationship between speculative investors and bitcoin’s success. According to Barry, speculative investors hold the key to bitcoin’s success because the promise of bitcoin as a payment rail, or method to send and receive money is not possible unless the monetary base is significantly higher than it is today. He adds, trading velocity needs to increase as well. Trends Shaping Bitcoin At Bitcoinist we asked Barry Silbert, What are some of the biggest trends shaping bitcoin? Barry mentioned some of the recent events on Wall Street. He pointed out the NYSE investing in Coinbase, Arthur Levitt advising BitPay, and Blythe Masters leaving JP Morgan Chase to become CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain trade settlement firm. Barry says you can look at bitcoin on Wall Street in two ways: as a speculative investment for trading the blockchain technology applications for trade settlement and clearing Will Wall Street Lend Stability to Bitcoin? The answer to this question Barry says, is: “Long-term, yes. Short-term, no way.” Barry says the bitcoin exchange market is a very fragmented global market that creates fairly large volatility. Therefore, he predicts bitcoin volatility to increase in the short-term. If the price of bitcoin increases, however, then the market will be able to withstand higher market purchases, he explains. Indeed, Wall Street is quickly moving in on bitcoin, and the signs are apparent. Barry states, “This is the year of bitcoin on Wall Street. I have been predicting this for awhile.” Inside Bitcoins New York will be held in NYC on April 27-29, 2015. Barry Silbert will speak on Day 3 of the event, April 29, 2015.

bitcoinist	belarus-cryptocurrencies-icos-now-legal-tax-free-five-years	Belarus: Cryptocurrencies and ICOs Now Legal, Tax-Free for Five Years - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-22T15:30	Belarus might not be the first country that springs to mind when you think about a blockchain and crypto hub, but if its president, Alexander Lukashenko, has his way, that’s exactly what it will become. Even though digital currencies have been firmly placed in the spotlight in 2017, blockchain technology has also been right up there in the popularity polls. It may be most well known for being the underlying technology supporting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but that’s really just the tip of the iceberg. It’s key features, such as offering permanent and immutable record-keeping capabilities, means that it can be used in nearly every industry. It’s a potential global solution for mainstream businesses and one that Lukashenko wants Belarus to be a part of. Today saw the president sign a decree which could put the country in the running for becoming an international tech refuge. According to Bloomberg Technology, Belarus will soon be offering legal incentives and tax reprieves for those trading in cryptocurrencies. The revenue and profits received from crypto-based dealings will be tax exempt until 2023. Lukashenko had this to say: Belarus will become the first government in the world that opens wide opportunities for the use of blockchain technology. We have every chance of becoming a regional center in this area. Blockchain-based businesses will also be legalized in the country. In addition, the decree details the methods that will be implemented to streamline the venture capital process between Belarus and other countries. This new legislation paves the way for Belarus possibly becoming an international center for ICOs. Belarus 🇧🇾 legalizes cryptos, ICOs, blockchain, smart contracts…everything!!👏😺 FYI mining, creation, acquisition and sale of digital tokens will remain tax-free until Jan 2023 🤓‼️NO TAX‼️ #Belarus #crypto #blockchain #ICO #legalization $BTC pic.twitter.com/NYOmpACC4O — jokeer (@jokeer_letsgo) December 22, 2017 No Stranger to Tech Even though these developments are new, Belarus’s fascination with the tech industry is not. Viber, which is a mobile IM and call-making app, was developed in the country. Other Belarus exports include NYSE-listed EPAM Systems Inc. and World of Tanks, and online gaming platform. The latter was founded by Victor Kislyi, who subsequently became the country’s first billionaire. Lukashenko has gained an infamous reputation as being one of Europe’s last dictators. Restrictive measures placed on businesses meant that even though big names like Alphabet Inc. were buying promising start-up, venture capital wasn’t flowing in to finance new and innovative ideas. This should change with this new legislation, which could pave the way for the country becoming a secure place for tech enthusiasts to bring their ideas to fruition. Growing the Nation, One Tech Company at a Time This secure space, or sandbox, will be located within the Hi-Tech Park. Lukashenko’s new legislation will hopefully help to integrate local businesses with the mainly offshore software corporations that work in the park. The latter benefit by gaining affordable and highly skilled labor, as well as reduced taxes. In Lukashenko’s quest to transform the country into a “tech nation”, he has garnered the support of technology companies, the government, and the central bank. First in Line to Offer Clarity If this move is successful, Belarus will become the first country, even ahead of Russia, who will provide a clear and legal framework for crypto. Denis Aleinikov, whose law firm Aleinikov and Partners assisted in drafting the decree, added that there will now be a legal link between crypto token issuers and those that buy and hold them. The new legislation would also detail important criteria that need to be met by exchanges in order to minimize fraudulent activity. In addition, smart contracts will be introduced to aid in efficiency. Vsevolod Yanchevsky, head of Hi-Tech Park, had this to add: The decree has been written exactly the way our tech community wanted it. Belarus will be one of the best jurisdictions in the world for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. What do you think about an authoritarian state encouraging decentralized and disruptive blockchain technology? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, kv.by
bitcoinist	big-investors-making-big-money-bitcoin	Big Investors are Making Big Money with Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2017-10-29T16:15	Bitcoin’s base of supporters is growing and increasingly pouring money into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Now, this base is attracting financial giants, who are becoming familiar with Bitcoin’s value and perceiving its fantastic potential. As a result, they are seriously starting to invest in the cryptocurrency. For example, Bill Miller is successfully investing a third of his hedge fund’s capital in Bitcoin. Once a Successful Stock Market Investor, Now a Successful Bitcoin Investor Bill Miller Influential investor Bill Miller managed a portfolio that beat the stock markets for the period 1991-2005. Now, he is also making lots of money with Bitcoin. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Miller has invested 30 percent of his fund’s assets in Bitcoin. Notably, he bought Bitcoin when it was $350 USD. As of this writing, Bitcoin’s price is above $5,900 USD. Among its $2.3 billion in assets is a $154 million hedge fund, MVP 1. The fund is up 72.5% so far this year, Mr. Miller said in an interview. It has about 30% of its assets in bitcoin, he said, up from about 5% in 2016. Famed value-fund manager Bill Miller is bullish on bitcoin https://t.co/l7xXl5h8pE via @WSJ — Jason Zweig (@jasonzweigwsj) October 27, 2017 Miller expressed his optimistic views about Bitcoin, saying: I believe there is still a nontrivial chance bitcoin goes to zero, but each day it does not, that chance declines as more venture capital flows into the bitcoin ecosystem and more people become familiar with bitcoin and buy it. Some Old-Time Investors Still Remain Unfamiliar With Bitcoin As more people become enlightened with the virtues that Bitcoin offers, the number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts is growing exponentially. However, many big-time investors remain uneducated about the cryptocurrency. And fearing the unknown, they resist change and keep on being skeptical. One notable example is the magnate Warren Buffett, who is ignoring the potential of Bitcoin and remains unconvinced about Bitcoin’s amazing qualities. Indeed, he is unable to appreciate Bitcoin’s value. Hence, he mistrusts it. Recently, addressing business school students, Buffett said, “You can’t value bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset.” Then, he referred to Bitcoin’s spectacular upward trend as a “real bubble in that sort of thing,” MarketWatch reported. It is not the first time that the Oracle of Omaha has failed to see the potential that innovation and new technologies can offer. In fact, one of the problems that has affected Buffett’s decision making has been his unfamiliarity with and lack of interest in technology. For example, Buffett previously failed to appreciate the potential of technology and social media stocks, such as Google and Facebook. Now, Buffett recognizes that excluding technology stocks in the Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio has been one of his worst mistakes. While discussing his failure to buy Google, at the time Google’s founders approached him to participate in the IPO, he admitted failing to act due to his ignorance. In this connection, Buffett said: And so I had plenty of ways to ask questions or anything of the sort and educate myself, but I blew it. Buffett also explained missing the opportunity to buy Amazon, by saying that he had been “ too dumb.” More Familiarity with Bitcoin will Change Negative Perceptions Warren Buffett Granted, there are financial tycoons of the caliber of Warren Buffett and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who will resist change and technological innovation. However, many other big names in finance and industry are becoming cryptocurrency enthusiasts. For example, Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, is excited about Bitcoin. In 2014, Gates declared, “Bitcoin is better currency.” Likewise, Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, is excited, believing that Bitcoin is better than gold and the mighty US dollar. Perception about the cryptocurrency is rapidly evolving, as reflected by Bitcoin’s soaring value in the financial markets. And, as education in cryptocurrency reaches multi-billionaires and their inner circles, their resistance to Bitcoin will decrease. Consequently, many of them, such as Bill Miller, will start to see and profit from Bitcoin’s amazing potential. What do you think will be the impact when the world’s wealthiest people become more educated about Bitcoin? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

bitcoinist	big-money-casascius-1-btc-coin-sells-for-28700	Big Money! Casascius 1 BTC Coin Sells for $28,700 - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-13T11:00	A certified Casascius 1 BTC coin just sold for $28,700 on eBay, an amount much higher than the current $14,300 that a single bitcoin is going for. It may be that cryptocurrency is moving into the realm of collectability as well as a means of financial transaction. A Casascius 1 BTC coin that was originally released back in 2011 as part of the coin’s second series just sold on eBay. The winning bid was an eye-opening $28,700. Bidding War Overall, the Casascius coin had 166 bids placed upon it. The seller bravely started off the auction at 1 cent. This was pretty gutsy as the coin contains 1 Bitcoin in value, which currently stands at $14,399. The auction got off with a bang as the first bid raised the price to $10,100, and the action just heated up from there. For a couple of days, bidders nibbled away at a $20,000 bid that someone had put into place. On the last day of the auction, the price went from $17,200 all the way up to $28,700. The coin has an ANACS rating of MS 65, which equates to an absolute mint state. The Bitcoin value of the coin is unredeemed, and the private key is contained on a piece of paper that has been sealed to the coin with a tamper-evident hologram sticker. What is a Casascius Coin? These coins are rather unique. Their creator is Mike Caldwell, who decided to transform virtual currency into physical coins. Caldwell minted coins that included the key to access a specific amount of Bitcoin, normally 1 BTC. However, he did make denominations up to 1000 BTC. The coins were pretty popular, but Caldwell was shut down by the federal government. Back in 2013, Caldwell received a notice from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), a part of the US Treasury Department. They felt that his business equated to transmitting money. If he wanted to continue, he would have had to do a tremendous amount of registering and complying with both state and federal regulations. Overall, Caldwell minted 27,673 coins, boasting a total amount of 59,383.9 BTC. At the current value of Bitcoin, the total amount of coins he made is worth a staggering $854,920,910. Just like other collectables (looking at you, action figures!), a mint Casascius coin that has never been spent tend to be worth more than the value of a single BTC. If you have the urge to expand your coin collection, there are additional Casascius coins to be found on eBay in both loaded and unloaded varieties. Would you have bid upon this particular auction? If so, how high would you have gone? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Wikimedia Commons and Bitcoinist archives.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-4000-south-korea-price	Bitcoin Hits $4,000 in South Korea, 44% Above Global Market Price	2017-05-25T11:00	The upsurge in demand for Bitcoin in South Korea is causing the cryptocurrency to trade with a considerable premium in the country of 44%. Bitcoin in South Korea In the midst of the Bitcoin rally, some countries are seeing more excitement than others. Most notably, Japan which has recently passed a law to recognize Bitcoin as a legal method of payment pushing the popularity of Bitcoin and its trading volumes to new levels within the country. However, one county which has flown under the radar is also experiencing a considerable growth in the Bitcoin market, South Korea. The demand is so strong in the country, that Bitcoin is now trading at a 44% premium. The price is currently sitting at 4,311,720 KRW, worth roughly $3,860, and went to as high as $4,246. Not only that, but Japan is also trading Bitcoin with a premium of 16%, making investors even more bullish about the virtual currency. Over time, the KRW trading volume has grown continuously and it is now the fourth highest, following that of China’s CNY. In the last 24 hours, exchanges have seen over $234 millions worth of KRW exchange hands in the BTC/KRW market, an impressive amount of money. Political Turmoil So, why is South Korea seeing such an upsurge in demand for Bitcoin? Although South Korea is a Bitcoin-friendly place with multiple exchanges and a few BTMs, not much has changed recently in terms of regulation or infrastructure. However, the political climate in the country is uncertain. And as we’ve come to experience, Bitcoin thrives in the face of political and economic uncertainty, a safe-haven property that is derived from its decentralized nature, a property that makes Bitcoin completely independent from any kind of oversight and control by any government or entity. Sandy Liang, Operation Director of BitKan, told Bitcoinist: One of the reasons for explaining the situation may be problematic relationship between South and North Korea. Probably, that’s why people consider Bitcoin as one of the ways to save money in case of unforeseen circumstances. In the face of a possible conflict, it is only logical that many would want to protect their savings as the country’s currency could rapidly decline in value under such circumstances, as history has shown us many times. Ethereum in South Korea What’s even more intriguing is that it’s not just Bitcoin. Ether is also making a killing in the country, with the KRW making up over 30% of the daily trading volume, making it the second highest traded pair for Ethereum following Bitcoin. And, much like Bitcoin, ETH is also trading at a considerable premium when compared to the USD. Ether is currently worth 348,515KRW, which is more than$311 in USD. That’s a premium of over 50%, also demonstrating an overwhelming demand for the altcoin in the country. What’s more impressive is that Ethereum trading volumes in the country are even higher than those of Bitcoin. With over 465 billion KRW exchanged in the last 24h, the demand for Ethereum is much more accentuated than that of Bitcoin which saw roughly 266 billion KRW exchanged in the same time frame. Ethereum Classic is also getting widely popular in the country with similar volumes to Ethereum (429 billion KRW) following the addition of ETC to the popular South Korea-based exchange Bithumb. Could the political tension lived in South Korea and other countries push the demand for Bitcoin to new levels? Let us know in the comment section. Images courtesy of CryptoCompare, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	bitcoin-bet-make-someone-million-dollars-richer	Betting on Bitcoin Could Make Some(one) a Million Dollars Richer - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-21T09:30	Recent trading data shows that a Bitcoin bet of a million dollars was placed on the cryptocurrency reaching the $50K mark by the end of 2018. Bitcoin has been subjected to some intense speculation over the past year. Its massive growth in 2017 has experts scrambling to predict where it will go to from here. It reached the $20K mark on some exchanges last week, with its integration to the mainstream financial industry well underway with CBOE and CME futures trading. Crypto enthusiasts have faith that this is just the beginning, with Bitcoin advocate Michael Novogratz forecasting that the currency will be trading at $50K by the end of next year. Making Millionaires One Bitcoin at a Time Some traders have taken this prediction to heart, or wallet, based on trading data on LedgerX. According to Express, a Bitcoin bet of a million dollars was placed by one or more traders, wagering that the world’s most popular crypto would reach $50K by the close of 2018. The e-market start-up company’s chief executive, Paul Chou, can’t name names due to privacy regulations, but he did hint that it was probably a hedge fund behind the six-figure bet. He said: Without a doubt, there are institutions out there that are looking at these types of trades or have done these types of trades. It’s not an individual, let’s put it that way. D-Day is set for the 28th of December 2018. In the event that Bitcoin is trading at $50K or more on that day, the bidders will be able to purchase 275 bitcoins at $50K each. However, if the currency is trading at less than that, the bidders will get nothing, except the knowledge that they are short $1 million. Continous Growth and Bubble Threats At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at just over $17K, compared to just under $1K in January this year. This is a growth of over 1,700% in less than a year. In addition, the currency grew by over 80% in this month alone. In the case of Bitcoin, every silver lining seems to have a cloud. As the excited voices of enthusiasts grow louder, so do the bubble chants of critics such as Jamie Dimon and Jordan Belfort. Nicholas Gregory, who is the CEO of the cryptocurrency business enabler, CommerceBlock, gave a bit of cautionary advice on Bitcoin’s price: Once Bitcoin starts to behave more in tune with traditional foreign exchange markets, people’s faith in it will only grow. However, that means it is not immune, and should not be immune, from price corrections either. Even though naysayers have been vocal with their criticism, it only seems to spur Bitcoin on, always putting it ahead of the pack in terms of price and popularity. Do you think Bitcoin will reach the $50K mark by December next year? Or do you think it could happen even sooner? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	bitcoin-breaches-4000-milestone-in-record-breaking-week	Bitcoin Value Breaches $4000 Milestone in Record-Breaking Week - Bitcoinist.com	2017-08-13T11:30	After stubbornly resisting a $3000 price point for weeks, Bitcoin has managed to effortlessly sail towards its latest $4000 all-time high in a matter days following it’s breakout last week. It’s a bullish time for Bitcoin. Investors were exuberant last week as Bitcoin finally broke its infamous $3000 price point. Now the bulls are out of the pen, and Bitcoin prices continue to soar. Yesterday, prices finally pushed past $4,000, setting a new milestone in Bitcoin history. Although the digital currency briefly fell back down to $3800 after grazing its high water mark, it has since recovered and is now trading for around $4,135 at the time of this writing. So far 2017 has seen Bitcoin smash record after record. Not only did Bitcoin post all-time high prices on a nearly daily basis leading up to this benchmark, but it has also done so barely a week after its previous high of $3000. A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats Bitcoin was not the only digital currency to see bullish trends this past week. Ethereum’s price spiked up past $300, up from $220 following the breakout earlier this week. It has yet to return to its previous high of $400 seen in mid-June right before the end of the cryptocurrency market’s previous bull run. Bitcoin Cash’s price also recovered some following losses during its first week of trading. From starting prices just above $200, BCH rose sharply to $378 on August 9 before settling again at around $300. Litecoin also saw modest gains this week, up $2 from $46 last week. Ripple remains a notable outlier in this group. Although last week’s frenzy gave it a brief boost to $0.19, it has since fallen back down to its previous average of around $0.16 Chaos is a Ladder The South China Morning Post attributes the rising value of cryptocurrency to heightened international tensions between North Korea and the United States. The paper calls digital currencies “an unlikely safe haven… as traditional refuges such as gold and US Treasuries lose some of their lustre [sic].” Caught in between this fiery rhetoric is South Korea, a current hotspot for digital currencies. According to the SCMP, South Korea went into an Ethereum buying frenzy following US President Donald Trump’s threats against the DPRK: The Korean won makes up more than 40 per cent of ethereum trading volume, the highest among currency pairs, according to CoinMarketcap. Ethereum rose 4 per cent on Thursday to US$304, near the highest since June. The SCMP also notes that although Bitcoin’s notorious volatility is about 10 times that of gold, its decentralization promotes it as a safeguard against government turmoil. Bitcoin’s recent surge should, therefore, come as no shock to anyone. The Goldman Sachs Crystal Ball ® The new price point confirms Goldman Sach’s own predictions on July 3 that Bitcoin would eventually hit $4,000. Goldman Sachs chart analyst, Sheba Jafari, predicted Bitcoin would fall to a low of $1,875 during a “corrective 4th wave” before recovering: From current levels, this has a minimum target that goes out to 3,212 (if equal to the length of wave I). There’s potential to extend as far as 3,915 (if 1.618 times the length of wave I). It just might take time to get there. So far, both of these predictions have proven true. Bitcoin fell to just over $1,900 on July 19 amid the scaling debates leading up to August 1’s UASF activation. It quickly recovered following signaling for SegWit2x and has now soared past both of Goldman Sach’s min and max prediction. What’s Bitcoin’s new short-term price goal? Are you expecting a correction following this week’s miraculous gains? Images courtesy WorldCoinIndex, CoinMarketCap
bitcoinist	bitcoin-cash-big-blocks-fail-capacity	Bitcoin Cash: Big Blocks 'Fail' To Improve User Experience - Analysis	2018-01-14T15:00	The Bitcoin community has leveled new criticism against Bitcoin Cash (BCH) after data reveals its bigger blocks are not living up to developers’ promises. ‘Big Blocks Failed’ Analysis of BCH and Bitcoin (BTC) blocks which software advocate Ben Verret uploaded to Twitter Sunday suggests that Bitcoin blocks, despite being smaller, are verifying more transactions than BCH’s ‘big blocks’ approach. The concept of bigger blocks providing greater scalability was a central feature touted by Bitcoin Cash supporters, including major figures Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. Bigger Blockchain blocks would allow for more transactions to be processed at once, proponents say, thus giving users considerably faster and cheaper transactions. Ver himself last month tweeted that Bitcoin Cash’s Blockchain could “easily” handle the combined volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The current version of Bitcoin Cash can easily handle all of the Bitcoin Core and Ethereum transactions combined. — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) December 29, 2017 According to Verret and others, however, the format is already failing, as Bitcoin’s smaller blocks are handling more transactions in the same period than Bitcoin Cash’s bigger ones. “Big blocks failed,” he concluded after presenting results for three, six, twelve-hour and one-day periods. Big blocks failed. — Ben Verret [Boycott Conbase] (@verretor) January 14, 2018 Bitcoin Lows Ensnare Bitcoin Cash, Altcoin Markets Despite technical considerations, BCH has nonetheless appreciated considerably in value over the past several weeks, attaining USD highs as BTC fell due to regulatory upheaval in major trading market South Korea. The latest 24 hours’ trading has delivered more blanket losses, BCH and the major of other major altcoins following BTC as it lost around 6.6% to hit fresh 2018 lows of an average $13,480 per coin. Ver meanwhile continues to focus on BCH’s use as both a currency and a store of value, echoing similar public comments by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who went on record to mainstream media to suggest his altcoin fulfills currency requirements Bitcoin is currently unable to. Bitcoin Cash, unlike Bitcoin Core, is both a medium of exchange and a store of value. — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 12, 2018 Bitcoinist reported last week on rumors this week’s Wall Street bonus distributions would result in a fresh influx of cash into both Bitcoin and altcoin markets.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-com-cto-sells-bitcoin	Bitcoin.com CTO 'Sells' All His Bitcoin, Calls It 'Most Risky Investment'	2017-12-19T06:30	Bitcoin.com CTO Emil Oldenburg has claimed he has sold “all” his “unusable” Bitcoin (BTC) for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), also known as BCash. Oldenburg Touts BCash To Mainstream In an interview with Swedish magazine Breakit since reproduced in multiple outlets, Oldenburg called Bitcoin “the most risky investment you can make.” “It is an extremely high risk. I’ve actually sold all my bitcoins recently and switched to bitcoin cash,” he told the publication last week. “…The old Bitcoin network is virtually unusable.” In making the admission about holdings, Oldenburg goes further than his outspoken boss, Bitcoin.com owner and major Bitcoin Cash proponent Roger Ver. While not stating specifically he has abandoned his BTC holdings in favor of BCash, Ver has lambasted the ‘original’ Bitcoin both on social media and in more formal settings. Speaking to Bloomberg earlier this month, he said he had “sold the majority of his Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash.” “If you look at businesses around the world, they’re scrambling to adopt Bitcoin Cash… I’m really concerned with a markets right now.” Bitcoin Core ‘A Group Of Taliban’ While Ver has also caused significant controversy with his comments about both Bitcoin and some of its best-known supporters in recent weeks, Oldenburg has not yet named names. “It’s a group of fanatic bitcoin taliban who themselves do not use bitcoin everyday to want it like this,” he told Breakit about Bitcoin Core. “They see bitcoin like digital gold and a technical experiment, not something you should actually use. It will never be a currency used in everyday life or for people who run companies.” Despite Oldenburg himself being relatively unknown in the wider space, the story has gained curious traction across mainstream media titles apparently eager to seize on a new Bitcoin ‘FUD’ narrative. Belgian publication HLN even described him as Bitcoin’s “creator” who had “sold everything” in a conspicuously inaccurate headline. Belgian media on Bitcoin: "Creator of Bitcoin sells everything". Oh god. @emilolden is just another scammer working for @rogerkver who never had anything to do with Bitcoin. FML pic.twitter.com/ShwGQ7mxab — WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) December 19, 2017 In the week since the interview, BCash has been swept up in a new altcoin market surge which has seen many non-Bitcoin assets break new all-time highs far beyond their previous range. As Bitcoin’s own bullrun calms at around $20,000, BCash is trading at over $2400, while Monero and Dash see huge gains running to over $400 and $1250 respectively.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-end-money-as-we-know-it-film-review	Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It (2015) Film Review - Bitcoinist.com	2015-07-15T01:00	[ezcol_1quarter]★★★/5 Director: Torsten Hoffmann, Micheal Watchulonis Documentary Running Time: 60 minutes [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_3quarter_end] The subject of money is undoubtedly a source of enigmatic confusion. Many people have covered it, from economic professors, to bloggers and authors; even Ira Glass on NPR. But Bitcoin continues to feed confusion over what it is, how it got here, and whether or not it could change money in our lifetime. Director Torsten Hoffmann breaks out into the world of money with his energetic documentary, “ Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It ” (2015). It’s dynamic, filled to the brim with hard-hitting history. There’s electricity in the pace, a kineticism in the narration, a fervor in the subject matter and the high-stakes world of finance. It is a rapid film that catches you off guard, with a title as provocative as itself. The picture begins with a luring score that ushers us in, not to explore simply Bitcoin, but to hint at the basis of trade, commerce, and civil society. Montaging clips of personal interactions and crowds of people, Hoffmann opens the film as if opening the blinds on a warm and beautiful morning. His story of money is one filled with promise like a sunrise over a landscape of human spirit. It is this very story that Hoffman brings us along, flitting through moments of civilizations past, guided by the deep vibrato of John Barrett’s narrating voice. It is interesting, intriguing, and above all, intellectual. Yet, as a filmmaker in the realm of Bitcoin, one must straddle and balance the call of activism with the power of art. They are two forces that when utilized effectively, complement each other, but if misunderstood, falls flat on its face. Unfortunately for Hoffmann, this film is a somewhat uneasy mix of both. There are moments when it seems he forgets this, fitting stock footage into empty spaces and losing the vigorous dynamism that sparks the opening montage in the first place. Even his credits sequence plagues his film retroactively with an almost suicidal use of comedy that bluntly bludgeons the audience with absurdity, as if to ironically poison the conversation he spent 60 minutes building up. Additionally, the choice to film talking heads in front of the black curtain background cuts the film’s presence off from the vivid world that Hoffmann is attempting to point at. Unlike “Ulterior States” (2015), where the black curtain supported the gritty and underground guerrilla realm that Tomer Kantor explored philosophically, Hoffmann cuts himself off, weakening his own thesis of tying the historical and ideological underpinnings to the present and future reality. However, despite the shortcomings of the methods, “Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It” is undoubtedly an enjoyable documentary that thoroughly explains why bitcoin exists and what questions it poses to the establishment. Most definitely, the concept of a digital, decentralized currency is tearing those questions wide open and the answers being spilled out are deep-seated, long-standing propositions that place a magnifying glass onto the seemingly untouchable financial institutions at the base of modern commerce. What may be uncovered in the philosophical, political, and economic questions could have radical implications for the rest of the 21st century. At the end of the film, Hoffmann lands with this potent quote: “I’m sure that in twenty years, there will either be very large Bitcoin transaction volume… or none.” – Satoshi Nakamoto Indeed, Bitcoin could be the end of money as we know it, but perhaps it is the beginning of money as we will all find out.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-foundation-executive-director-bruce-fenton-outlines-plans-improved-transparency-inside-bitcoins-nyc	Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director Bruce Fenton Outlines Plans for Improved Transparency at Inside Bitcoins NYC - Bitcoinist.com	2015-04-30T09:00	Article by Kyle Torpey The Bitcoin Foundation has been wrapped up in controversy throughout its entire existence, but the non-profit organization could turn a new leaf with the appointment of Bruce Fenton as the new executive director. Fenton delivered a clear, concise presentation about the future of the Bitcoin Foundation at Inside Bitcoins NYC 2015, and he made some statements that could possibly grab the attention of even the most adamant haters of the foundation. Throughout his talk, Fenton brought up transparency as often as possible because it has been one of the most frequent complaints from foundation members over the past year. Also Read: Bitcoin Foundation Launches Blockchain Voting for Runoff Election Bitcoin doesn’t need a foundation, but it’s helpful One of the more shocking statements made by Fenton during his presentation was the idea that “we don’t need a bitcoin foundation.” He claimed, “We don’t need any centralized organizations [for bitcoin to succeed.]” While it’s clear that Fenton understands that the “ honey badger of money ” will always find a way to survive, he also added that centralized organizations, such as the Bitcoin Foundation, can be helpful. Just because a non-profit organization is not required for bitcoin to reach the masses doesn’t mean that such an organization cannot be helpful at all. My goal for @BTCFoundation is not to simply have a good image but to be a worldwide model for transparency and governance — Bruce Fenton (@brucefenton) April 16, 2015 Fenton’s push for transparency A large chunk of Fenton’s presentation was dedicated to the Bitcoin Foundation’s need for more transparency. Two slides from Fenton’s presentation listed a number of different changes that the foundation will make to increase transparency over time. He noted that the plan is to make the Bitcoin Foundation “the most transparent non-profit organization in the world.” In addition to implementing the ten items for transparency from the Natinoal Council of Non-Profits, the Bitcoin Foundation also plans to include (or has already included) the following measures for additional transparency: Hash financial data on the blockchain in a permanent record using Factom Use Swarm for blockchain voting Use Coinsider for open discussion Member forums and interaction Access to executive director Bruce Fenton Published bylaws on GitHub 100% member elected board Fenton also stated that anyone who has ideas for how to increase transparency to an even higher level should contact him as soon as possible. Supporting bitcoin development without funding it A final point of interest that everyone should take away from Fenton’s presentation is that the Bitcoin Foundation will continue to support bitcoin development; however, that support will not be financial in nature. I was able to ask Fenton to clarify that remark during the Q&A session of his talk, and he pointed out a few different ways in which the foundation can continue to support development without actually paying developers. The DevCore conference (a bitcoin conference that is more technical and meant for developers) was the first point that Fenton made in his response. Fenton noted that the foundation can also work with bitcoin companies, such as Blockstream and BitPay, to get them to work more closely on finding ways to privately fund bitcoin development. On a related note, Fenton also pointed out that it would not be wise to centralize bitcoin development at the Bitcoin Foundation. He claimed that it would be better to have multiple organizations supporting development rather than keeping centralized under one house. For now, the focus for Fenton and the rest of the Bitcoin Foundation is on transparency. It will be interesting to see how the community responds as many individuals have already decided to give up on this non-profit organization. You can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-gains-altitude-altcoins-falter	Bitcoin Gains Altitude While Altcoins Falter - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-05T23:00	Despite experiencing a slight dip recently, Bitcoin is climbing its way back towards its all-time high after breaking $17,000 today. After taking a hit in recent weeks with a surge in the market for alternative coins (altcoins), Bitcoin appears to have regained its moon-bound trajectory. According to Coin Market Cap, Bitcoin saw a 15% gain over the past 24 hours and reached a daily high of $17,705. While Bitcoin rises in price, however, alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple have seen dips ranging anywhere from 10%-20%. Does Bitcoin Rise at Altcoins’ Expense? Many altcoins experiencing price dips are no doubt simply victims of investors selling off their coins to buy back into Bitcoin – or whatever the altcoin du jour happens to be on a given day. Some, however, see their values fall because of very specific reasons. Take Ripple, for example. Between December 1, 2017, and approximately noon yesterday, the dark horse cryptocurrency saw gains of over 1400% – from $0.25 to $3.81. That gain was fueled – at least in part – by rumors that XRP was going to be added to Coinbase sometime in the not-too-distant future. Ripple’s climb was brought to a screeching halt yesterday when Coinbase co-founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong, tweeted: We haven't made any decisions to add new assets to Coinbase or GDAX at this time. Any statement to the contrary is untrue. Be careful what you believe out there! https://t.co/1yUYG33AoG — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 4, 2018 Just like that, XRP’s upward trajectory started to reverse itself, falling by over 19% in just under two hours’ time. Ripple managed to rally briefly before continuing to fall another 4% to a low of $2.83. Prices have begun to stabilize, but whether or not Ripple can regain its momentum remains to be seen. What factors do you think are contributing to Bitcoin’s rise? How about altcoins’ losses? Let us know in the comments below! Images Courtesy of CoinMarketCap, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	bitcoin-gold-issues-critical-warning-suspicious-windows-wallet-file	Bitcoin Gold Issues Critical Warning About Suspicious Windows Wallet File - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-25T21:45	Bitcoin Gold (BTG) has just issued a warning about a suspicious file of unknown origin found on their download links on their web page and on their Github release page. It seems that Bitcoin Gold has been dealt more than their share of bad luck recently. The company is still mired in the aftermath of the MyBTGWallet scam, and now they have been hit with another problem that is causing them to issue a critical warning to their customers. BTG has announced that they have found a suspicious file of unknown origin on a link on their download page and on their Github release page file downloads. Danger, Will Robinson! Danger! Bitcoin Gold (BTG) states in their critical warning that the file has been present in the link for approximately 36 hours. The file does not trigger antivirus/anti-malware software, however, in an abundance of caution, BTG is presuming that the file. BTG presumes that the file is of malicious intent to steal user information and/or cryptocurrency. The critical warning by BTG states: Anyone who downloaded the Windows Wallet file between November 24, 2017, 13:11, UTC and November 25, 2017, 22:30, UTC should not use the file in any way. If the file was used, the computer on which it was used should be addressed with extreme caution; the file should be deleted, the machine should be thoroughly checked for malware and viruses (or wiped clean), and any cryptocurrencies with wallets accessible on that machine should be moved to new wallet addresses immediately. BTG reminds users to always confirm their downloaded files via SHA-256 checksum. Affected Links Here are the affected links impacted by the suspicious file: Project Github Repository: https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/releases/tag/0.15.0.1 Project Download Page: https://bitcoingold.org/downloads/ Windows file Download SHA-256: 53e01dd7366e87fb920645b29541f8487f6f9eec233cbb43032c60c0398fc9fa bitcoingold-0.15.0-win64-setup.exe Linux file Download SHA-256 Hash: SHA-256: 25d7bf0deb125ecf5b50925a1c58e98c4b0b0a524470379c952f6b9310e97cfe bitcoingold-0.15.0-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.zip BTG notes that the links on the Download page point to the Github repository for the project, which is a standard procedure to link the source code with the compiled files. A party of unknown origin replaced the compiled Windows file with a different one on the Github repository. It is important to note that the Linux file was not changed and that the Github repository has been secured. The suspicious file has been replaced with a safe one, and the development team is doing a security audit to make sure all systems are safe. Lastly, BTG states that the source code was unchanged. If you downloaded the source code to compile it yourself, you should be fine. However, Bitcoin Gold does suggest that users check that their local repository matches the current Github repository and continue to exercise extreme caution.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-good-gold-well-actually-better	Bitcoin as Good as Gold. Well, Actually Better - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-02T12:00	If financial statistics are anything to go by, perhaps there should be a pot of bitcoins at the end of every rainbow as the cryptocurrency has outperformed gold for a second year running. According to Forbes, the Bitcoin Investment Trust gained 1407.42%, while SPDR Gold Shares only increased by 11.93%. Yes, you read that right. However, both gold and Bitcoin grew more than the S&P 500 and 20-year US Treasury bonds. This is the second time in as many years that Bitcoin has pulled rank over both gold and Wall Street. As with any investment, though, you cannot determine with complete accuracy if past behavior will guarantee the same results in the future. However, even though Bitcoin has been around for a short time compared to gold and fiat currencies, it already offers some important benefits. All That Glitters Is Bitcoin? Geoffrey Smith, who is a Finance Professor at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, gave some insight into a few of these advantages: Bitcoin has many advantages over government currencies, not the least of which is that its supply is fixed. Thus, its purchasing power cannot be diminished by ‘currency printing’ by governments. See Venezuela and their inflation, for example. Anonymity is also an advantage. The blockchain technology also provides perfect record keeping, which eliminates mistakes and the opportunity for fraud and theft. Smith also touched on borderless payments and circumventing corrupt governments: Bitcoin is also an international currency, which can be used to facilitate international trade. It may also be very useful in low-trust countries with high levels of corruption where the banking system and legal system protections are not very strong. It remains to be seen, however, if it is useful as a currency due to the high volatility. Yet the number of Bitcoin transactions seems to be increasing every day. Volatility Could Be a Deterrent This is definitely true. This year saw a general increase in awareness and interest in digital currencies, which saw spectacular price surges for many cryptocurrencies. In addition, mainstream adoption is on the rise as well, thanks in part to the introduction of futures trading launched in December. However, most investors still caution against dumping all your gold for bitcoins. The crypto industry has an intrinsic unpredictability that results in dramatic price drops like the corrections experienced last month. Not to mention that gold has been a stable and reliable store of value for thousands of years and will continue to do so. There is no doubt that virtual currencies are here to stay, with many countries opting to develop their own state-controlled cryptos. With fantastic growth predicted for Bitcoin in 2018, we’ll just have to see if history does indeed repeat itself with the currency overtaking gold for a third year running. Do you think Bitcoin will edge out gold and Wall Street again this year? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	bitcoin-haram-halal-muslim-religious-views-remain-conflicted-might-easing	Is Bitcoin Haram or Halal? Muslim Religious Views Remain Conflicted But Might Be Easing - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-11T17:15	The way that Bitcoin fits into various religions across the globe is very much a hot topic right now and, as might be expected, not everyone is on the same page. Global Bitcoin regulation and the approach various governments and policymakers are taking towards the regulation of, and legal framework that underpins, Bitcoin has dominated crypto-centric news media coverage (and, to a degree, more mainstream media coverage) over the past twelve months. With prices rising so dramatically across this period, this space has become something that said policymakers are no longer able to ignore and, be it accommodative or not, we’ve seen a range of approaches signed into law. The Religious Side of the Coin The compatibility, or lack thereof, of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with various global religions hasn’t attracted nearly as much attention. More recently, however, it seems this is changing. Back in November, news emerged from Turkey that Bitcoin has been deemed “not compatible with Islam.” The opinions voiced are those of the nation’s Directorate of Religious Affairs, or Diyanet, which is an organization set up to help deal with the implications of religion on everyday life in Turkey. More recently, at the start of last week, Jeddah-based cleric Assim al-Hakeem reported by way of his YouTube channel and associated program, AskZaad, that Bitcoin is haram (forbidden or proscribed by Islamic law), based on the fact that it is “an open gate for money laundering, drug money, and haram money.” So why is this news now? Well, because these views are now being countered by none other than the peers of those expressing them. 'Sharia standards do not cover this issue yet': 'Halal' #bitcoin may be coming to Muslim community near you https://t.co/JGyFhuOaJW pic.twitter.com/YI0MigA8w0 — RT (@RT_com) November 5, 2017 A Counter-view As outlined here, Muslim clerics are now declaring that owning bitcoin is compatible with Islam. There’s also this paper, published back in 2015 by Charles Evans (it is a couple of years old but the concepts are very much up to date and applicable here), which outlines the compatibility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the rules and laws of Islamic finance. Indeed, that paper even goes so far as to suggest Bitcoin might actually be more compliant with Sharia Law than fiat: Bitcoin or a similar system might be a more appropriate medium of exchange in Islamic Banking and Finance than riba-backed central bank fiat currency, especially among the unbanked and in small-scale cross-border trade. Whatever happens in the near term, there’s no doubt this is just the start of a long and multi-faceted discussion among global religious leaders and policymakers as to where Bitcoin fits into the current religious and economic frameworks that dominate modern society. What do you think? Should bitcoin be compatible with Islam? How can something like religion adapt to incorporate the implications of a technology like Bitcoin on global finance? Let us know below!

Just years ago, not even Satoshi Nakamoto or Nick Szabo (the creator of smart contracts), would have imagined that things would be moving forward on such a fast time scale.The event will run through October 29th and 30th and will feature many prominent Bitcoin companies and speakers. The D accepts Bitcoin for hotel bookings and even at their gift store. That’s right, you can buy alcohol with Bitcoin and it’s not a problem. Started by Steven Michaels, the event’s twitter handle is @Bitcoin_Up, which is very poignant given the recent double digit percentage rise in the Bitcoin price. Bitcoinist is proud to bring live coverage from the event so follow along at @Bitcoinist.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-makes-grand-entrance-onto-mainstream-stage	Bitcoin Makes its Grand Entrance onto the Mainstream Stage - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-10T18:00	Escorted by futures trading contracts, Bitcoin has entered into the circle of mainstream finance. This event was marked by the CBOE Global Markets’ launch of Bitcoin futures contracts, on Sunday, December 10, 2017, opening the door to the cryptocurrency market for institutional investors’ trillions of dollars. Moreover, Bitcoin futures has moved the rollout of Bitcoin ETFs one giant step closer to reality. Bitcoin Futures Could Bring Trillions into the Crypto Market Bitcoin made its debut in the world of mainstream finance under the symbol XBT. Many predict that this historic event will increase the number of participants and capital in the cryptocurrency market. For example, financial institutions and their vast amounts of dollars can now start trading Bitcoin. Institutional investors welcome the advent of futures because it provides a regulated framework for trading the cryptocurrency. Additionally, Bitcoin futures improve market efficiency. According to CBOE : [Bitcoin Futures] bring many benefits to traders, including transparency, efficient price discovery, deep liquidity and centralized clearing. XBTSM futures provide a centralized marketplace for participants to trade based on their view of bitcoin prices, gain exposure to bitcoin prices or hedge their existing bitcoin positions. Bitcoin’s Derivatives Open Door to ETFs Bitcoin is inherently volatile, and the advent of futures might further exacerbate volatility. In effect, hours before CBOE’s launch of the futures contracts, the cryptocurrency market was jittery, as shown by the wild swings of Bitcoin’s prices. Bitcoin’s price dipped from over $18,000 USD on December 8, hitting low of around $13,000 USD on December 10, 2017, before swinging upward again to its current price of just over $15,000. Futures bring new dynamics into the ecosystem. For example, market regulators will increase their scrutiny. Additionally, traders can now short sell the cryptocurrency. Another potential ramification to consider is that because Bitcoin futures occur within a regulated environment, it could make it possible to obtain SEC approval for the rolling out of ETFs. Spencer Bogart, head of research for Blockchain Capital, told ETF.com : If you look at what the SEC said in its ETF disapproval from earlier this year, it essentially needed to see the underlying bitcoin spot market become more regulated, or it needed to see a fully functional derivatives ecosystem that is regulated. The launch of Bitcoin futures provides concrete evidence that the financial industry has finally accepted Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin’s bubble will now either burst, as many have forecast or, Bitcoin will flourish, offering financial institutions unimaginable investment opportunities. What do you think the impact of Bitcoin futures trading will have on the SEC’s decision to allow Bitcoin ETFs? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay, CBOE, CoinMarketCap
bitcoinist	bitcoin-meetup-growth-around-world	Bitcoin Meetup Growth Around The World (April 20th - May 19th 2015) - Bitcoinist.com	2015-05-31T08:00	Bitcoin meetup groups are a great way to get together with like-minded people and discuss anything digital currency-related. Not only will you form a circle of new friends, but you will also be treated to a few presentations now and then. For those among us who like a few statistics, let’s take a look at some of the more recent changes and shifts in the Bitcoin meetup “power rankings.” Also read: California Bitcoin Bill May Pose Problems for Startups Bitcoin Meetup Growth Numbers Around The World The most popular Bitcoin meetup groups are to be found in traditional places. Major cities always tend to draw a bigger crowd, but that doesn’t mean that smaller communities are left in the cold either. Strength in numbers is a good thing — especially with Bitcoin — but that doesn’t tell the whole story either. During the course of April 20th to May 19th, there has only been one Bitcoin meetup group which has actively shrunk. The Israeli BTC Entrepreneurs meetup group has seen its numbers dwindle a bit, as there were 0.68% less members at press time compared to the time preceding April 20th. Considering this Bitcoin meetup group had a 10.8% member increase between February 20th and March 19th, thought, this small decline is nothing to worry about just yet. On the other hand, there were two Bitcoin meetup groups which have seen a very nice growth over the past month. Both Seoul Bitcoin Meetup (+10.47%) and Paris Bitcoin Meetup (+10.21%) have seen a nice uptick in members, which could indicate that new initiatives are brewing in those parts of the world. These percentages don’t tell the entire story of course, as the largest Bitcoin meetup communities will see a smaller growth number percentage-wise. That being said, the leading Bitcoin meetup groups are still growing month over month. It goes without saying that the overall trend indicates a growing interest in Bitcoin and its underlying technology. Note from the Author: to put these percentages in perspective, Seoul Bitcoin Meetup welcomed an additional 47 members, whereas Paris Bitcoin Meetup welcomed 68 new members. Israel’s BTC Entrepreneurs group’s loss represents 4 members leaving, which is not that big a number to worry about. Rankings According to Total Members When looking at the current top 23 Bitcoin meetup groups around the world — according to the information we have received — there are only 7 groups with member totals in the four-digit range. London, the financial capital of the world, is home to the second largest Bitcoin meetup group with 2,312 members. This marks an impressive milestone, however, as it the first time in a long while that the London Bitcoin meetup group has not been the largest in the world. That crown now belongs to BitcoinNYC, with its 2,321 members. But we will also have to keep an eye on the San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup, as they are not too far behind with 2,170 members. Bitcoin of South Florida is ranked #23 on this list, with 304 members. Comparing that to the local Bitcoin meetup groups I attend in Brussels and Ghent, we still have a long way to go. On the other hand, a small group of people creates a more intimate sphere, which also has its advantages compared to large gatherings The Official Power Rankings on May 19th, 2015 The official power rankings of these Bitcoin meetup groups may look quite a bit different compared to what you may expect. Ranked all the way at the top is Seoul Bitcoin Meetup, who have been steadily climbing the ranks since April 19th, when they were ranked fourth. Yet Seoul Bitcoin Meetup held the number one spot before, right up until February 19th. Bitcoin Wednesday Amsterdam, the previous chart leaders, have slipped from the #1 position all the way to #8 over the past month. Despite a growth percentage of 4.02% and welcoming 33 new members, they are hitting the spot of diminished returns. Keeping in mind this Bitcoin meetup group has over 850 members right now, it won’t take much longer for them to reach the 1,000 mark. Last but not least, we have the Bitcoin HK meetup group, which has climbed in the rankings by quite a bit. Just a month ago, Bitcoin HK was ranked #15 while they are now #6, which can be attributed to their 42 new members – a growth of 6.01%. It is a very positive trend to see these numbers increase in parts of Asia, and not just in the US or Europe. Are you a member of a Bitcoin Meetup group, and if so, which one?

bitcoinist	bitcoin-outperform-dollar-fiat-3-year	1200% Bitcoin Outperforms Dollar and All Fiat for Third Year in a Row	2018-01-13T08:00	Bitcoin was the best-performing currency in the world for a seventh time in 2017, beating major cryptocurrencies and all fiat yet again.* 2017 Was Bitcoin’s 3rd Best Year Bitcoin’s 1200% annual growth last year took it easily to the top of the league against the global fiat basket, while only a handful of less mainstream altcoins posted bigger returns for investors. 2017’s Bitcoin harvest for hodlers was the best since 2013, which was the cryptocurrency’s best ever year that spawned near 5500% returns. 2011 contributed 1387% gains, while 2010 offered up 480%. By contrast, 2016 delivered “only” 130%. *While altcoins, such as Ripple, broke records with annual dividends topping 16,000% last year, these are not included in the table due to their still somewhat limited status as assets. Bitcoin is more widely-accepted and has dedicated financial instruments catering to a broad range of private and institutional investors. In terms of investor activity, however, 2017 led Bitcoin to new heights not anticipated for at least several more years. As BitGo engineer and online commentator Jameson Lopp notes reporting data from Blockchain, $375bln in BTC changed hands over the course of the year. This is the equivalent to around $12,000 each second. https://t.co/W7qaVBd7R4 estimates (by removing likely change outputs) that ~$375 billion was transacted via BTC in 2017, averaging nearly $12,000 per second. https://t.co/sQke38CutB pic.twitter.com/0iJ13wwk9b — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) January 12, 2018 2018 Full Of Promise For BTC Investors Trading volumes are only set to grow in the new year, as is evident by Bitcoinist reporting this week how the incoming Wall Street bonus payments on January 15th are slated to produce a “buying spree” across cryptocurrency markets. Experts have further tipped the likely go-ahead for Bitcoin ETFs by US regulators for 2018, as the climate changes from that which led to several rejections by the US Securities and Exchange Commission last spring. A spokesperson from CBOE, which launched Bitcoin futures trading in December, revealed before Christmas: Given the success of the launch of our bitcoin futures, several partners are very interested in moving forward with the development of an exchange-traded product. Data also shows that Bitcoin-driven ETFs were also the best performers in their class for 2017. Overall, the virtual currency that dominated headlines throughout the year is just keeping its winning streak going. It’ll be interesting to see if it continues to grow substantially throughout 2018.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-posts-lowest-ever-36-market-cap-share-ethereum-steals-limelight	Bitcoin Posts Lowest Ever 36% Market Cap Share As Ether Steals Limelight	2018-01-02T13:30	Bitcoin’s overall market cap share dropped to a record low of 35.8% Tuesday as lackluster growth gave altcoins a major advantage. Ethereum Advances Hook Investors Despite recovering above $14,000, Bitcoin has failed to hold on to prices closer to its all-time highs of $20,000 seen in December. By contrast, investor money has poured back into altcoin markets, with the majority of major assets appreciating dramatically and weathering short-term volatility. At press time, gains were being spearheaded by Ethereum’s Ether (ETH), which continues to profit from the anticipation of a long-awaited Casper release. The technology’s alpha testnet was formally unveiled December 31. In a follow-up blog post today, co-founder Vitalik Buterin also announced a grant program and so-called Blockchain ‘sharding,’ both of which aim to shore up longer-term Ethereum network scalability. Buterin summarized: We view the two strategies as complementary with each other and we believe in supporting a multi-pronged strategy toward Ethereum scalability that engages both strategies and treats them as complementary with each other. Scaling Specters Elsewhere in altcoin markets, several coins in the top 20 have seen significant recent gains, including Bitcoin hard fork Bitcoin Cash, which is heading towards $3000 per coin after falling more heavily than Bitcoin itself during its rout below $13,000 last month. Ripple is also heading back towards all-time highs above $2.40, while NEO has surged to approach $93 per token, almost trebling in value in under a month. Commenting on current trends, Noded Podcast presenter and Bitcoin maximalist Pierre Rochard noted differing philosophies regarding scaling in Bitcoin and Ethereum camps. Despite the incoming release of Lightning Network improvements for Bitcoin, the issue of its usefulness purely as a currency remains a decisive topic of debate. Contrast between the BTC and ETH scaling philosophies: BTC: self-interest, decentralized bounty from fee market, engineers ETH: charity, centralized grants from Ethereum Foundation, researchers pic.twitter.com/RCnbOcpsLN — Pierre Rochard (@pierre_rochard) January 2, 2018 The largest cryptocurrency meanwhile had been recovering its share of the market, surpassing multi-month highs of 66% before a major reversal halved the figure in a matter of weeks.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-price-lunar-new-year-lows	Dark Side Of The Moon: Bitcoin Sets Lunar New Year Lows For 3rd Time	2018-01-16T05:30	News of a fresh crackdown on cryptocurrency trading in China has added to stress on Bitcoin and altcoin markets, seeing assets lose 30% in hours. $200 Billion Disappears In New Downturn Bitcoin dipped around 13.7% to challenge $12,000 Tuesday as both South Korea and China present regulatory changes which could limit access even further for regular users. Despite local Korean news outlets forecasting that a “shutdown” on the cryptocurrency exchange space was “not likely” Monday, the situation remains confused as lawmakers attempt to place restrictions on everyday traders. In China, where exchanging to fiat was banned in September, authorities are now seeking to “end” the “centralized” trade of cryptocurrencies in any form where entities are acting as “market makers,” sources claim. Government agencies met last week to discuss the additional measures, with People’s Bank of China Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng writing in a memo seen by Reuters that there was clear consensus for a further crackdown. “The financial work conference clearly called for limiting ‘innovations’ that deviate from the need of the real economy and escape regulation,” he announced. In comments to mainstream media, UK-based eToro senior market analyst Mati Greenspan said the knock-on effect for traders was potentially driving the downtrend in lessening volume. “The pullback seems to be coming from a lack of buyers in Asia,” he suggested. “Japan and South Korea usually dominate this market but over the last few days, the volumes have been dropping steadily.” The Koreans and Japanese are used to paying a premium of 20 percent or more per coin. It seems they’re getting wise and waiting for the market to even out before buying in again. A Familiar Sight For Moongazers According to averaged exchange data from Coinmarketcap’s listings, altcoins reacted considerably more sharply to Bitcoin’s dip, major assets declining between 20% and 30% over the same period. In a curious contrast to previous upsets caused by China, local platform NEO’s token is currently performing the best in the top twenty, falling just 6.3%. A total of $200 billion was wiped off markets. Reacting to the news, cryptocurrency commentators noted that it was only the reporting of the meeting by Western media this week that precipitated the price volatility, Chinese sources allegedly having known about its content via social media “rumors” since last week. The rumour about exchange blocking emerged late last week in CN-speaking internet forums and wechat groups. Very reliable sources started talking Saturday and more confirmation Sunday. It then got picked up by Western media Monday. — Crypto Angela (@wealthreduction) January 16, 2018 Meanwhile, a more light-hearted commentary on the price lows came from data analysis showing Bitcoin systematically set its lowest value for each of the past three years in the second week of January. The bottom came January 15, 16 and 12 for 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively. The unspoken power of the lunar calendar on Bitcoin ties in conveniently with another pattern, that of steep corrections precluding further upward price action in the coming period.

bitcoinist	bitcoin-rescue-economically-unstable-countries	Bitcoin to the Rescue in Economically Unstable Countries - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-07T05:00	Bitcoin seems to be the knight in shining armor for countries suffering distress due to corrupt governments and volatile economic climates. Bitcoin’s race to the top of the crypto charts has been filled with record-breaking prices, mainstream integration into the financial industry, and overall sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement. In waiting for the currency to reach the next price milestone, it may be easy to forget what it’s actually there for. Even though it may have a somewhat infamous reputation as being the preferred medium of exchange for shady deals, Bitcoin’s goal is to completely revolutionize and disrupt the global economic industry. Bitcoin Offers a Welcome Respite From Corrupt Institutions This is especially true in emerging markets, or in countries where the political and socio-economic sectors are fraught with corruption and an iron-grip control on finances. In addition, it could be the potential answer to the huge problem facing the unbanked population. According to the Wall Street Journal, crypto users in Sudan, Kenya, and South Africa are fast latching on to Bitcoin as a lifeboat while navigating the choppy waters of economic uncertainty in their respective countries. Circumventing Sanctions in Sudan Mohammed Mahgoub, who is a Sudanese web developer and early Bitcoin fan, had this to say: The main attraction in Bitcoin is the ability to transfer money without any restrictions or going through a bank, this was very important as there were US sanctions imposed on Sudan. The country has been subjected to financial sanctions for nearly 30 years, negatively impacting cash outflow and making the purchasing of international imports extremely difficult. In addition, because it is seen as a sponsor of terrorist activities, the country is still on the blacklists of most Western banks. A Facebook group called Bitcoin Meetup Sudan consists of a range of members hoping to learn more about the cryptocurrency. One member wants to raise funds for her NPO by using Bitcoin, while another wants her dowry to be paid in bitcoins. On the flip side of the bitcoin, financial institutions in developed countries have cautioned people on the risks of using digital currencies as they are not backed or supported by a bank or by the government. However, this is the exact reason that cryptocurrencies have become so popular in emerging markets as it cannot be controlled by untrustworthy authorities. Arnaud Masset, an analyst at Swissquote, which is a brokerage offering Bitcoin trading to retail clients, further explained: Buying cryptocurrencies is seen as a protection by people who have been constantly disappointed by central banks and politics. Masset went on to add: When conventional money fails, Bitcoin wins. Masset also touched on using virtual currencies as a way to alleviate sanction stress: It’s a convenient and fast way to skirt sanctions. The supply-and-demand principle is clearly evident with the super crypto. Because its demand is so high in developing countries, its price is well above the global average. On some exchanges in Zimbabwe, like Golix, one Bitcoin traded at $22k, compared to the $15k it was trading at on CoinDesk. Bitcoin Finds South African, Brazilian, and Kenyan Fanbases eToro reported that phenomenal increases in Bitcoin usage were seen in South Africa and Brazil in 2017, with trading in the former increasing by 671% over less than a year. This massive growth was likely as a result of the country’s president axing the well-respected former Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan. The South African rand was also downgraded to junk status by S&P Global Ratings in November last year. Mati Greenspan, an analyst for eToro, stated that Bitcoin usage grew in Brazil as a result of ongoing corruption involving both the country’s former and current presidents. Kenya is another country experiencing massive Bitcoin growth, 1,400% in 2017 alone. They use the currency to place bets, and people even use it to pay for and gain access to services not available to Kenya, such as Spotify AB. Smartphone Growth Is a Silver Lining Despite the Dark Cloud of Volatility However, the currency’s volatility is a real problem in these developing countries. Being in a somewhat precarious position financially can be even more frightening when your Bitcoin investment is losing value every hour, as was the case with the currency’s price correction last month. Digital currencies may be increasing in popularity in these countries, but they still have a long way to go before being adopted as a common medium of exchange. However, the growing smartphone market in Sub-Saharan Africa is a positive factor in a faster integration. According to GSMA Intelligence, this growth is predicted to happen at a rate of 50% faster than the global average over the following five years. Do you think emerging markets will continue to increase their usage and adoption of digital currencies? Would this result in more aggressive regulation efforts by the governments in these countries?

bitcoinist	bitcoin-shining-brighter-gold	Bitcoin Trending 3 Times Higher than Gold in Google, 11 Times More Valuable - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-07T01:15	For the first time in history, gold faces a formidable challenger: Bitcoin. Today, the cryptocurrency surpasses, by many times, the precious metal in value and popularity. Bitcoin Surpasses Gold in Popularity For millennia, humanity has used gold as a medium of exchange and store of value. People have used the precious metal as a long-term investment and as a hedge against market volatility throughout history. And, because of its lustrous sheen, gold is used as decoration, particularly in jewelry. However, gold may now be losing its luster thanks to the advent of Bitcoin. Simply put, Bitcoin is presently more popular than gold. In fact, many believe in Bitcoin’s superiority over the precious metal. For example, the co-founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, explicitly stated: Bitcoin is better than gold. Wozniak’s sentiment seems to be shared by a growing number of investors, as reflected by their interest in the cryptocurrency. According to The Telegraph: Online searches for information on buying Bitcoin now far outstrip equivalent searches about investing in gold – even at the peak of the banking crisis, when investors feared a full-blown collapse of the world’s financial and banking systems. The Telegraph refers to the Google Trends chart, shown below, to illustrate that “The search term ‘buy Bitcoin’ first surpassed ‘buy gold’ as a Google search term in May this year. It is now many times more popular.” trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"buy bitcoin","geo":"","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"buy gold","geo":"","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"buy silver","geo":"","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"q=buy%20bitcoin,buy%20gold,buy%20silver&date=today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); Bitcoin Surpasses Gold in Value On March 3rd, 2017, a Bitcoin coin surpassed the value of one ounce of gold. At that time, Bitcoin had reached $1,268 USD, while the value of one ounce of gold was $1,233 USD. Since then, the price difference between these two assets has increased exponentially. As of this writing, Bitcoin’s price is over $14,000 USD, and the price of gold per ounce is $1,266.70 USD. Bitcoin is recognized as a store of value. And, it has proved to be a safe-haven currency during crisis situations, such as was witnessed during the Brexit fallout. Moreover, Professor Panos Mourdoukoutas points out various other advantages of Bitcoin over gold, stating: First, [Bitcoin] can be used as a convenient medium of payments, though for a limited number of transactions, a function [that] gold is missing. Second, the Bitcoin supply is expected to be limited to 21 million. The supply of gold, on the other hand, is expected to increase anytime its price rises, as it provides an incentive for gold miners to mine for gold. Granted, gold still has certain advantages over Bitcoin. “Gold can be used as an outright gift, to make jewelry, and in the manufacturing of certain products,” says professor Mourdoukoutas. The obsolete banking system and the three-thousand-year-old monetary system are becoming casualties of the cryptocurrency’s all-encompassing technological revolution. For the first time in history, thanks to Bitcoin, gold has met its match. Indeed, as of today’s market data, the cryptocurrency is obviously eclipsing gold. What do you think are Bitcoin’s advantages over gold as a store of value? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock and Pixabay
bitcoinist	bitcoin-superb-job-creator	Demand for Bitcoin Jobs Surging as Price Continues to Climb - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-04T10:30	Like the Internet a few decades ago, Bitcoin is now becoming one of the greatest job creators. In fact, Bitcoin and blockchain-related job listings are at an all-time high on sites like LinkedIn and Dice. Bitcoin is Disrupting the Job Market The advent of the cryptocurrency is creating incredible new opportunities in finance, business, and industry. As a result, the demand for Bitcoin-related services is growing exponentially, which in turn is driving the creation of thousands of new jobs. Moreover, Bitcoin’s rapid evolution to becoming a mainstream financial asset is attracting thousands of new users. As evidenced in the past few weeks, Bitcoin’s skyrocketing price trajectory has driven thousands upon thousands to become Bitcoin exchange subscribers. Consequently, Bitcoin exchanges such as Coinbase, Gemini, and GDAX have been overwhelmed and shorthanded, unable to respond to such an extraordinary demand. In fact, Coinbase services had to be suspended, for the second time, when Bitcoin’s price was nearing $11,000 USD, on December 1, 2017. As a result, Coinbase is now flooding the social media and job sites trying to hire workers with skills relevant to cryptocurrency technology. In this regard, Bloomberg reports that the number of job postings is surging on LinkedIn: Bitcoin-related job postings as a proportion of total listings on LinkedIn jumped more than ninefold in the financial services industry over the past three years and 4.6 times in the software technology industry, according to data from the career-oriented social network. The New Economic Model Requires Crypto-related Skills Bitcoin and its blockchain technology, along with other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, are creating fantastic new business solutions and good paying jobs. However, to develop and implement these new business solutions, individuals with skills related to Bitcoin and blockchain technology are required. In fact, LinkedIn reports that there has been a spectacular increase of over 500 percent in crypto-related job postings. The crypto job market is booming. If you are interested in a career in the emerging field of cryptocurrencies and want to explore available job opportunities, you may wish to visit sites such as Freelancer, LinkedIn, Dice, Indeed, or the Coinbase career website. What are your thoughts about the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and the demand for cryptocurrency-related specialists? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Pixabay
bitcoinist	bitcoin-will-give-japans-economy-substantial-boost	Bitcoin Will Give Japan's Economy a Substantial Boost - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-31T05:00	Bitcoin and cryptocurre ncies had a year of exceptional growth in 2017. The cryptocurrency market cap managed to surpass the valuation of $638 billion and many experts believe that it will further increase. The Cryptocurrency Job Market 2017 was one of the most exciting and interesting years for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and Ethereum had a spectacular bull run and managed to make huge gains for investors and traders. We also had a huge number of Initial Coin Offerings and a record-breaking amount of funding. ICOs managed to raise over $3.7 billion in funding for blockchain and cryptocurrency-related projects. Most of these startups were successfully able to raise their funding goals and are now on a hiring spree. An article by Fortune mentions that the number of Bitcoin and blockchain-related job listings grew by over 5,753%. Experts believe that this is just the start and that the number of Bitcoin jobs will rise further in the upcoming years. Some governments have decided to implement regulations and laws in order to attract Bitcoin companies to operate in their countries. The most recent example is Belarus, which implemented new laws to officially legalize cryptocurrencies and give them a tax-exempt status for the next five years in the hopes of attracting companies to start operations in the country. How Japan Will Benefit from Bitcoin Japan has become one of the most popular countries for Bitcoin and blockchain-related companies. One of the major reasons for this situation is the fact that the Japanese government has proper regulations and laws that favor cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year, the Japanese government officially recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method. This caused a major price increase, as many Japanese investors decided to invest in the decentralized cryptocurrency. Analysts at Nomura believe that the price rise of Bitcoin has given many investors a very high return on investment, which might lead to a boost for the economy of Japan. The lead of the analyst team, Yoshiyuki Suimon, stated the following: Rises in asset values often result in a rise in consumer spending, too, known as the wealth effect. We estimate the wealth effect from unrealized gains on bitcoin trading by Japanese investors since the start of fiscal year 2017, and estimate a potential boost to consumer spending of 23.2-96.0 billion yen. He also added: Moreover, the fact that the rise in bitcoin prices was concentrated in 2017 fourth quarter could result in the wealth effect materialising in 2018 first quarter, and if that is the case, we estimate a potential boost to real GDP growth on an annualised quarter over quarter basis of up to about 0.3 percentage points The effects of Bitcoin are multiple on the economy of Japan. Not only are further jobs being created, but the resulting wealth effect from the cryptocurrency’s rise in value is spurring real and measurable economic growth. As more cryptocurrency exchanges and operations move to Japan, it’s likely that this financial trend will continue unabated. What are your thoughts on the high amount of gains caused by Bitcoin? Do you think that it will benefit Japan’s economy? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay
bitcoinist	bitcoin-work-really-bubble	How Does Bitcoin Work? Is It Really a Bubble? - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-26T24:00	If you haven’t heard of Bitcoin by now, you’ve probably been living under a rock. However, while many people know what Bitcoin is – and have even willingly put forward large amounts of their own money to invest in it, despite having heard of it for the first time yesterday – very few people know much more beyond that. You don’t need to know all the technical details behind Bitcoin to get started – that would take far too long – but whether you’re planning to invest in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency or not, a little information about it can go a long way. A Brief Overview of Bitcoin… Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’. You can view the original white paper here. To many, the real value of Bitcoin is not its ability to be used as a currency, but the technology that powers it. This is known as the blockchain. It is a shared public ledger, upon which the entire Bitcoin network relies. Every single confirmed transaction is included in this blockchain, and once it has been included it cannot be reversed or edited. The integrity of the blockchain is securely enforced with cryptography. Bitcoin uses a Proof of Work algorithm, meaning it must be mined. As a result, it goes without saying that the main way to acquire Bitcoin – aside from buying it at an exchange – is to mine it. What is Bitcoin Mining? Bitcoin mining works via a distributed consensus system that is aimed to achieve overall system reliability. It is used to confirm transactions. Upon being included in a block, a transaction will receive a confirmation. When a transaction has been confirmed, it means it has been processed by the network and that it is very unlikely it will be reversed. When transferring large amounts it usually makes sense to wait for several confirmations, as each confirmation will exponentially decrease the risk of a reversed transaction. This has multiple purposes. It ensures that the blockchain has a chronological order, protects the network’s neutrality, and ensures that the state of the system has been agreed on by multiple different computers. Blocks cannot be modified, as this would invalidate all subsequent blocks. As a result, the technology is extremely secure. Is Bitcoin a Bubble? A few weeks ago, everyone was clamoring to throw all their money into Bitcoin as fast as they could. Now, you can hardly hear the word ‘Bitcoin’ without the word ‘bubble’ following it. Bitcoin shows many of the signs of a classic bubble. For example: The price of Bitcoin is extremely volatile. Many people are calling the concept of private Bitcoin transactions into question. A few massive investors own the majority of the market. However, determining whether it actually is a bubble or not is very complicated, because Bitcoin is an entire industry. Whether Bitcoin really is a bubble or not is still up for debate. But even if it is a bubble, the biggest question is: how long will it last? Yale economics professor and Nobel Laureate, Robert Shiller, recently voiced his opinion about this unpredictable cryptocurrency in an interview. He said: [Bitcoin] might totally collapse and be forgotten and I think that’s a good likely outcome but it could linger on for a good long time, it could be here in 100 years. However, the co-founder of Glint, the gold cryptocurrency startup, completely disagrees with the idea that Bitcoin is a bubble, and argues that people are simply not looking at the bigger picture. In an interview, he stated: Bitcoin is not a bubble, albeit it has all the hallmarks and antecedents that are the precursor to a bubble. The term bubble tends to indicate a price no reasonable future outcome can justify. In price terms, bitcoin and altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) are in a bubble. In value terms, bitcoin is not. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin? This is the big question that everyone is asking. Bitcoin is still in its early days yet. Less than a decade ago, no one had ever even heard of Bitcoin. Since then, it has managed to shake off its bad reputation as a currency used to buy drugs and trade illegally online. Now everyone wants to own it. One thing is for sure: regardless of the fluctuations of the price of this cryptocurrency, the technology behind Bitcoin is here to stay. What do you think? Is Bitcoin a bubble or a bona fide investment? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of AdobeStock
bitcoinist	bitconnect-sees-sustained-growth-amid-surge-adoption	BitConnect Coin Sees Sustained Growth Amid Surge in Adoption - Bitcoinist.com	2017-05-14T13:37	The UK-based Bitcoin startup, BitConnect is experiencing a substantially consistent growth of its BitConnect Coin cryptocurrency. The sustained rise in user adoption follows the company’s announcement of record value and market capitalization, during Q1 2017. [Note: This is a press release.] BitConnect Coin is a community-driven, open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, designed for mass adoption and has a limited total supply of units. The cryptocurrency (BCC) entered the market in Q1 2017 and recorded a market capitalization of $10 million (USD) and a value of $2.00 (USD), within weeks of its initial listing on CoinMarketCap.com. BitConnect Coin’s early growth saw the cryptocurrency enter the top 20 charts for alternative coins in total capitalization value for the first time in this quarter. Since this feat, the cryptocurrency has continued to grow and has continuously broken records in both value and market capitalization. On April 13, 2017, BCC recorded a market capitalization of around $90 Million (USD) at a unit value of $15.01, signifying a 900% growth in market capitalization and a 700% increase in value over a period of about three months. At this point, BCC surpassed the long established Litecoin (LTC) in terms of unit value and overtook Dogecoin (DOGE), in total market capitalization. Since BitConnect Coin’s inception, it has seen rapid, yet steady growth, which has most likely been a result of an increased rate of adoption, a strong community base and the limited total of units in supply. Unlike most other cryptocurrencies BitConnect does not require centralized exchange platforms and can be traded directly between community members, making trading the currency slightly easier than some of its alternatives. Compared by some to Bitcoin, which saw similar community growth, BitConnect Coin has seen a faster growth in terms of value. BitConnect Coin’s steady growth, expanding community and liquidity make it an interesting alternative currency for traders and crypto-enthusiasts.

bitcoinist	bitconnect-shuts-amid-crypto-crash	Bitconnect Shuts Down Amid Crypto Crash - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-17T06:15	Following months of bad press and publicity, lending and exchange platform Bitconnect has announced that it is shutting down. Many had suspected the platform of being a Ponzi scheme, and it had suffered multiple DDoS attacks on the website. In an announcement on its website, the platform said it was closing the lending operation immediately with the release of all outstanding loans. The notice cited continuous bad press, including two Cease and Desist letters from the securities boards of Texas and North Carolina. Coin Collapse Bitconnect has stated that it will refund all active loans at a rate which it calculated from the past 15 day average price. With release of your entire active loan in the lending wallet we are transferring all your lending wallet balance to your BitConnect wallet balance at 363.62 USD. This rate has been calculated based on last 15 days averages of the closing price registered on coinmarketcap.com. Within moments of the notice, the BCC token price plummeted from around $180 to $24 amid a general market decline across all cryptocurrencies. According to TechCrunch, many users will still have suffered severe losses on their fiat, or Bitcoin equivalents, if they had invested in BCC, which is effectively useless now since the platform has shut down. Condemnation A number of prominent crypto experts have also labelled Bitconnect as a Ponzi scheme, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Litecoin’s Charlie Lee who tweeted: Turns out it was a ponzi after all. Sorry for those that got caught up in this. Ponzis work because people are easily fooled. Bitconnect was an anonymously run operation that allowed users to loan their cryptocurrencies to the company for large returns of up to 40% per month. A large referral system generated a pyramid scheme on social media, with users plying their referral links for extra commissions. The loans were in USD but had to be made in BCC, which could be purchased with Bitcoin. As its popularity grew, the token gained value and climbed from $10 in mid-2017 to a high of $435 at its peak at the end of the year. Bitconnect has stated that they will continue supporting the coin: Closing the lending and exchange platform doesn’t mean that we will stop supporting BitConnect coin. Closing the lending platform will allow Bitconnect to be listed on outside exchanges giving more options for trading. This is not the end of this community, but we are closing some of the services on the website platform and we will continue offering other cyptocurrency services in the future. Although with the token’s value approaching the floor, renewed confidence and investment in BCC remains a very forlorn hope. Did you use Bitconnect and has this affected you?

bitcoinist	bitkan-p2p-volume-keeps-growing-china	Bitkan: Peer-to-Peer Volume Keeps Growing in China - Bitcoinist.com	2017-05-11T11:00	The halt on cryptocurrency withdrawals from Bitcoin exchanges in China may be coming to an end. Bitcoin talked to Bitkan to understand the situation with Bitcoin exchanges and how it has affected P2P trading in the country. Withdrawals to be Resumed The halt on cryptocurrency withdrawals imposed by Chinese exchanges is coming to an end, with withdrawals expected to be resumed in June 2017. The moratorium was caused by the task forces assembled by the country’s central bank to inspect said exchanges. While all operations are expected to continue next month, the top three exchanges, BTCC, Huobi, and OKCoin will receive punitive action under charges of not complying with AML guidelines. A situation that has lasted for more than three months and that has changed the Bitcoin landscape entirely in China, the moratorium on withdrawals may be coming to an end. However, since the removal of several features like the zero-fee policy, margin trading, and cryptocurrency withdrawals, Bitcoin traders have begun to flock towards P2P solutions like Bitkan. Bitcoinist talked to Bitkan to better understand the current situation with Bitcoin exchanges and how it has affected peer-to-peer trading in the country. Bitkan is a Chinese p2p exchange that has seen an unprecedented growth following the PBoC interventions, seeing its user base grow rapidly at 150 thousand per month. Bitcoinist: Do you think the upsurge in BitKan’s popularity is due to the withdrawal moratorium in centralized exchanges or due to the steep KYC requirements that these will have to employ? BK: We have to admit that the both things are sort of reasons for the upsurge these days. Bitcoinist: What do you think new customers are more drawn to in Bitkan, causing them to choose it over other p2p alternatives? BK: Bitkan has multiple functions, like market data, industry News, wallet. This one application can meet different needs of each user. The whole trading process on Bitkan is very easy. Just some simple steps then you can sell/buy Bitcoin at a good price. Every trader on Bitkan needs to pass strict KYC. During the trading process, Bitkan does the escrow and frozen Bitcoin for safer trading. Bitcoinist: Does BitKan see a pattern in the types of services these new customers are interested in (buying and holding/trading/selling BTC payments, etc) BK: We think these three needs are increasing now. On Bitkan, the most popular part is still trading. Because during these days, there are price gaps between sell and buy side on Bitkan. Also, Chinese people are very passionate in earning a profit in market volatility. Bitcoinist: Compared to USD exchanges, there is currently a huge discount (~$300) when buying/selling Bitcoin with CNY on centralized exchanges. Is Bitcoin also trading with this discount on BitKan? BK: No, on Bitkan the price is very fair, equal to international standard. For example, 5.10, the price on the Chinese exchange is 9962RMB, 1450USD, but on Bitkan’s P2P trading platform, the selling price is around 12600RMB, 1855USD. Bitcoinist: Do you expect the growth of BitKan to continue after the withdrawals are reactivated on centralized exchanges? BK: Yes. Since the forbidden withdraw thing happened, more and more people know Bitkan. As a P2P platform, we are more easy-using, because we have a mobile application with trading function. Also, Bitkan is not a new company which just pump into this market for short time profit. Bitkan has already been in Bitcoin industry for almost 4 years. We gathered huge user group and earned good reputation during past four years. So, we have the confidence that the market won’t fall down because of the opening withdrawing.

bitcoinist	bitkan-volume-twelve-pboc-withdrawals	BitKan: Our Volume Grew 'Twelve Times' Since PBoC Halted Withdrawals	2017-03-07T24:00	Bitcoinist spoke with Leon Liu, the CEO of BitKan, a Chinese P2P Bitcoin trading service, to get a better idea on the current situation following the recent regulatory clampdown on Bitcoin exchange withdrawals in the country. Bitcoinist: What kind of trading services does BitKan provide? Leon Liu (LL): BitKan provides P2P bitcoin trading services with broker match-making to save time for our users. During a trade, BitKan acts as an escrow service, guaranteeing funds delivery for both sides. Users can also trade small amounts in five minutes. Bitcoinist: How has the recent restrictions imposed by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) on crypto-exchanges impacted your operations? LL: The PBoC focused on the three biggest exchanges. PBoC actions did not have any impact on us because it focuses on money laundering, currency outflows and pyramid schemes. We do not provide such services to our customers. That’s why we weren’t impacted. Right now, customers can use our platform to withdraw Bitcoin after 3 days. Bitcoinist: China’s overall Bitcoin trading volume has seen a significant drop due to these PBoC inspections. Have traders gone abroad or have they simply moved off-exchange and into P2P and OTC markets? Have you seen an uptick in P2P, OTC trading as a result? LL: There are two kinds of customers: the first kind buys bitcoin and uses it. So, they need to withdraw bitcoin. Yes, some of these people went to other small markets, where withdrawals weren’t suspended. Some went to the OTC market. It is difficult for Chinese people to access foreign markets. Therefore, these customers cannot buy Bitcoin abroad using CNY. Also it is difficult to exchange CNY to USD in China. Our volume grew by twelve times [since withdrawals were suspended]. The second kind of customer trades bitcoin, buying and selling it to earn a profit. In fact, most people speculate with the price this way, and then they withdraw CNY. And yes, our volume grew by twelve times. Bitcoinist: Who is your typical customer? LL: We have two kinds of customers. Those new to bitcoin and who buy their first bitcoin on our platform; and then there are users who already have basic knowledge about bitcoin and who do not want to trade on exchanges. Bitcoinist: How does your P2P trading service compare to the increasingly popular LocalBitcoins, for example, which has seen exponential growth in China following the suspension of withdrawals? LL: The first step for our customers is registration via email. If they want to trade on our platform they need enter their cellphone number. If users want to trade more that 5 BTC a day – they need to comply with KYC and AML guidelines. The difference with LocalBitcoins is that BitKan offers a mobile phone app that is easy to use. Second, all traders must go through the KYC process, to ensure safe trading. BitKan is better localized for the Chinese market compared to LocalBitcoins Third, trading is faster than on LocalBitcoins and a trade can go through within a minute. Fourth, BitKan is better localized for the Chinese market compared to LocalBitcoins. Bitcoinist: So customers can buy up to 5 BTC with just their email address? LL: Yes, the maximum is 5 BTC without having to submit any personal information. Bitcoinist: Do you agree with BTCC CEO Bobby Lee that Bitcoin is not being used to bypass Chinese capital controls – that it’s mostly hype created by the media? LL: We agree with Bobby Lee. This goes back to 2013 when the government said that Bitcoin is a commodity. It can not be used by companies for payment. Now, Bitcoin is used mainly for two things in China – mining and trading (speculation). Bitcoinist: Bitcoin mining giant BitMain invested $1.6 million into your platform last year. What have you done with these funds so far and what are your future plans? LL: We spent the investment on global promotion and development. In the future, we are going to roll out our OTC business globally. Segwit will not be the best solution for Bitcoin scaling, it will make the Bitcoin network more complicated. Bitcoinist: Bitmain is a supporter of the Bitcoin Unlimited scaling proposal. Where do you stand on this issue in the scaling debate? LL: We support Bitcoin scaling first and foremost, but we do not support a fork. We hope that the parties can reach some agreement. My personal opinion is that SegWit [Segregated Witness] will not be the best solution for Bitcoin scaling, it will make the Bitcoin network more complicated. Bitcoinist: Finally, how is your planned expansion into the US market coming along? LL: This is still in the early stages, but we are making some progress. The USD market is now the second biggest for BitKan. The US has different regulatory policies across different states, and BitKan will comply with these laws accordingly.

bitcoinist	bitmain-looking-launch-canadian-bitcoin-mining-operation	Bitmain Looking to Launch Canadian Bitcoin Mining Operation - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-12T16:00	In response to increased regulatory pressures in China, Bitmain wants to set up shop in Canada. Bitmain is one of the largest and perhaps the most well-known bitcoin mining and hardware companies in the world. Its primary operations are, as is expected for a company that’s headquartered in Beijing, located in Asia (notably central China and the autonomous Inner Mongolia) but, as per recent reports, it looks as though the company might be looking to diversify its geocredentials. China Losing Market Share It is well known in this space that China’s government has sought to crack down on cryptocurrencies over the last twelve months or so. Policymakers and regulators in the Asian superpower have forced exchanges to close, restricted the flow of cryptocurrencies into, out of, and inside the nation, and is now putting considerable pressure on bitcoin miners. Bitmain falls into this latter category and it’s believed that this regulatory pressure is behind the company’s desire to branch out to alternative regions that operate under alternative (and, in most cases, far more accommodative) regulatory frameworks. The latest reports suggest that Bitmain is now looking at Canada as a potential home for a portion of its international mining operations. Specifically, and as confirmed in an email from the company’s spokesman, Nishant Sharma, Bitmain is looking at sites in Quebec and is in talks with regional power authorities in the province. An Attractive Location Quebec is an attractive home for bitcoin mining operations for a variety of reasons, including access to cheap, renewable energy and a climate that’s complementary to the physical demands of this sort of large-scale operation (in other words, the cool climate mitigates the necessity for expensive cooling equipment at the mining sites). Here’s what David Vincent, director of business development at Hydro Quebec distribution, had to say about Quebec’s positioning in this space: Of the world’s top five largest blockchain players, we have at least three or four. It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first foray into the Canadian market for Bitmain. The Independent reports that Bitmain’s spokesman acknowledged that Bitmain has been mining in Canada since 2016, though he did not say where. The company is also reportedly looking to set up shop in Switzerland, another region that is known in the sector for its accommodative cryptocurrency framework. Is Canada a good choice? What does this mean for China’s position in this sector? Let us know in the comments below! Image courtesy of Aurelien Foucault/Quartz, Pixabay
bitcoinist	bitpado-dubais-latest-crypto-exchange	BitPado: Dubai’s Latest Crypto Exchange - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-23T22:30	Dubai continues to embrace blockchain technology through the latest addition to its available exchanges, BitPado. We recently reported on how Dubai was well on its way to becoming the smartest city in the world by planning to launch 20 blockchain-based services in this year alone. Now, according to Arabian Business, the city will also unveil their latest development: BitPado. The Dubai-based exchange was founded by Omar Kassim, who made his mark on the ecommerce world with his online market, JadoPado. The business was subsequently sold, with BitPado becoming Kassim’s latest venture. The platform describes itself as being the “the next crypto exchange and OTC market for the Middle East, Africa, and Asia”, and will trade in top virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Blockchain for the win Kassim is firmly on board the blockchain bandwagon as he is also working on another project, Esanjo, a worldwide real estate management service operating on the blockchain network. In fact, it was while working on Esanjo that he realized the current issues in the crypto industry in the country presented a gap in the market. Kassim explained: We’re seeing similar problems in the crypto space right now around understanding and supplier acceptance. Given previous experiences and network in the region, we thought we could solve those solutions together and bring a new product to the market. Even so, Kassim has not revealed who, besides Esanjo, will be investing in the new exchange. The founder of Dubai-based ecommerce platform @JadoPado – @okassim, that was acquired by @noon last year has announced his latest project; BitPado, a crypto exchange for Middle East, Africa & Asia. #blockchain #cryptocurrency #dubai #uae https://t.co/wWTetIuCSP — Discovered (@discovered_ae) January 21, 2018 Make way for crypto exchanges Just last week, Arabian Business also reported on another new Dubai-based exchange: Palmex. Launched by blockchain-based startup ArabianChain, the exchange will trade in some of the usual crypto suspects in addition to the startup’s own virtual currency, the DubaiCoin. According to Mohammed Alsehli, who is the CEO of ArabianChain, the time is now for launching trading platforms: The demand to trade and issue digital assets has grown exponentially with the phenomenal surge in valuation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the rapid evolution of blockchain technology. The regional market is ripe and hungry for a user-friendly platform that makes it possible for them to buy and sell in a secure environment. Alsehli also touched on the benefits of a local exchange for traders based in the Middle East: You have a legal entity in the region you can actually reach and approach, a company and face that you know. It adds an element of trust. In addition, Dubai has vocalized their interest in creating and issuing their own controlled digital currency, emCash, a trend that seems to be growing this year as Sweden also recently announced its own plans to launch their e-Krona. Do you think localized exchanges will increase crypto trust and subsequent adoption in those countries? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock
bitcoinist	bitstarz-now-accepts-litecoin-ltc-bitcoin-cash-bch	BitStarz Now Accepts Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T16:00	Monday, Jan 29, 2018 – In an announcement that is sure to have gamblers everywhere smiling from ear to ear, BitStarz Casino is now accepting Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) deposits and wagers. Becoming one of the very first online casinos in the world to accept both of these leading altcoins – with BCH recently becoming a fixture at Coinbase – BitStarz is looking to open the door to altcoins by offering LTC and BCH support. LTC – one of the world’s foremost altcoins – launched back in 2011. Evolving from Bitcoin, it has grown to become not just a tremendous option for those looking to diversify, but also a viable currency for anyone that has intentions of taking the world of online casino play by storm. Fast payment confirmations, adaptive technical upscaling, and in many ways presenting the perfect compliment to Bitcoin, it was no surprise to see LTC’s value skyrocket during 2017. BCH launched just a few months’ back, coming about through the Bitcoin Classic fork that caused a trading frenzy. What helped to generate interest in BCH was the increased size of its blocks, allowing for more transactions, lower transaction fees, and quicker transaction speeds. The whole purpose behind BCH was to craft a cryptocurrency that could compete with PayPal and Visa when it comes to transaction levels, which is probably why the demand for it amongst gambling circles has grown. The altcoin market has been bubbling over lately, with this certainly not escaping the attention of the BitStarz team. Listening to players, it has covered every base to ensure that LTC and BCH are made available for use. Allowing members to deposit and wager in LTC and BCH at will, Softswiss games specifically will initially allow players to bet through BCH, with more providers waiting in the wings to add BCH betting support. Taking its cost-effective fees and speed on board, it’s easy to see why the demand for both LTC and BCH functionality has grown, with BitStarz answering the call. Topping the tree when it comes to hybrid-currency online casinos, Bitstarz.io has forged ahead, embracing Bitcoin as a payment option unlike anyone else. It isn’t just Bitcoin that features on the BitStarz cashier page either, with LTC and BCH now joining the ranks. Players will be able to play the hottest online casino games around through LTC and BCH deposits, so you won’t be left waiting should you want to put your Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash to work. Known for Bitcoin support, but now giving LTC and BCH its share of the spotlight, there is a reason as to why AskGamblers has labeled BitStarz as one of the most reputable online casinos around. Srdjan Kapor (BitStarz Marketing Manager) was quick to comment on the arrival of LTC and BCH: As the uptake of Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash continues, the timing is perfect for us to announce that we will now be accepting both as deposit methods. Proving that we are one of the most flexible and accommodating online casinos around, BitStarz is happy to add LTC and BCH to our wealth of available cashier options moving forward. About BitStarz BitStarz has blazed a trail for Bitcoin-based gambling around the globe, combining it with major international currencies to create a seamless online casino platform. That’s not all, as, alongside Bitcoin, LTC, and BCH support, it loads up on games unlike any other casino around. Retro slots, video slots, 3D slots, progressive jackpot slots, and an array of table-focused favorite, you’ll never be left wanting for games at BitStarz that’s for sure. Powered by an Antillephone N.V, Curacao gaming license, outstanding personal service, souped-up withdrawal speeds, and a game selection that just keeps growing, BitStarz has become the leading name in Bitcoin – and now altcoin – casino play!

bitcoinist	bitstashers-upgrade-paper-wallet-metal	Bitstashers: Should You Upgrade from a Paper Wallet to Metal?	2017-04-04T06:00	Bitcoinist spoke with Jon Boroughs of Bitstashers, a provider of metal-etched Bitcoin wallets that are designed to withstand an apocalyptic event unlike a fragile paper wallet. These are also not limited to cold storage as they can also be custom made for colored coin asset addresses as well. Metal-Etched Bitcoin Wallets Metal wallets are quickly becoming a thing in the crypto space with a few options available such as Cryptosteel and Bitkee, which start at $40 USD. However, Bitstashers provides custom metal etched wallets at a much lower price point, starting from $15, and includes multiple form factors such as dog tags and bottle openers. Boroughs reveals to Bitcoinist the idea behind metal wallets, why they’re better than paper, and how privacy is preserved during the manufacturing process with BIP38 encryption. Bitcoinist: Where did you get the idea to create metal etched wallets? Jon Boroughs (JB): Honestly, we saw another company trying to do this with sub-standard materials and at a higher price and we thought we could do it better and cheaper. We also pride ourselves on our design abilities and thought we could offer customers a wide variety of great designs for their wallets as well as possibly letting them submit their own ideas. Bitcoinist: Why is metal better than a paper wallet that costs zero? JB: Metal wallets are great for long term storage. Paper wallets can deteriorate over time, but the Bitstashers wallet is made to last until the day you die. They are even fire-proof. The stainless steel wallets can withstand temperatures of up to 1,300­­ degrees Fahrenheit. Each of our wallets are etched using quality materials and they’re so durable we’ve even filed our fingernails with the design and it comes out looking like nothing happened. The design withstands any normal wear that it may come across. You can’t expect that with paper. Bitcoinist: What is Heliopay and what kind of supporting role does play in relation to Bitstashers? JB: Heliopay handles Bitcoin ATMs mainly. They describe themselves as “Bitcoin ATM’s, point of sale, services and supplies, digital infrastructure, payment management solutions and more! Industry leading equipment, the UK’s widest range of bitcoin merchandise for resale (now including the UK’s largest range of physical bitcoins), consultancy, technology integration, excellent training, we help our customers at all stages of the adoption process, helping them to prepare for the new wave of digital payment services, software and infrastructures required.” We usually work with Heliopay when we need wallet addresses as they have a superb, secure, offline air-gapped computer that generates secure wallet addresses. We also have done production work in the past for them such as designing wallets and other products. Bitcoinist: How much does this type of wallet cost for aluminum and steel? Does it depend on type? JB: It depends on the material. Stainless steel costs more for materials than the aluminum type. Aluminum card wallets are priced at $18 each, bottle openers are $18 each, and dog tags are $15 each. Stainless steel card wallets are $25 each, bottle openers are $25 each, and dog tags are $18 each. We are also experimenting currently with other materials so as to broaden our product offerings. Keep an eye out for those in the future. Bitcoinist: Do you also etch both keys – the public and private keys? JB: Yes, we can etch both keys. The purchaser can choose to have both keys on one side or have the private key on one side and the public key on the other. Or another way it can be done is by using something like our dog tags. You can wear the public key and then hide away your private. Bitcoinist: Where, how, and by whom are the keys generated? JB: The keys are either generated by the purchaser of the wallet or by Heliopay.com on a secure, air-gapped address generating system. Bitcoinist: Can you explain your stance on BIP38 encryption ? JB: We think that BIP38 encryption is the best way to feel at ease when handing your keys over to someone like us so we can put them on products. When you generate a Bitcoin wallet address you’ll get a public key and a private key. The industry standard is to never hand over you private key. That’s good advice. But with BIP38 you take that private key and encrypt it with a password you make up in your head. The best way to input that password when you do BIP38 encryption is to enter it on an on-screen keyboard as we all know that keyloggers are an issue now-a-days. At that point you can hand your encrypted key to a place like us and we can engrave it. With a BIP38 encrypted key someone would have to be able to read minds to get the password you used. Bitcoinist: How is the private key protected or shielded from prying eyes or cameras, for example? JB: The wallet is considered more like a “savings account” rather than a spendable “hot wallet”. It is intended to be a safe have to store your cryptocurrencies without the fear of hackers stealing your funds. Since these addresses are etched in metal, is it a concern for users who are often advised to not reuse the same addresses when transaction from a security standpoint? No, since our wallets are not intended to be used as a “hot wallet.” Our wallets are intended to be similar to a saving account (minus the interest) for the cryptocurrency world. Would you use a metal etched wallet? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Bitstashers, Shutterstock, openbazaar
bitcoinist	blockchain-conferences-san-francisco	Blockchain Conferences In San Francisco Highlight New Direction For Technology - Bitcoinist.com	2016-03-18T06:00	Blockchain conferences are much different than Bitcoin conferences. Whereas Bitcoin conferences might have been heavy on theoretics about liberating the world’s unbanked, the blockchain conference has a much more generalized focused. Many new participants in the space are uninterested in wildly shaking up the status quo. Also Read: Tendermint To Unveil UI, Demo First Blockchain Apps Blockchain Conferences Reveal New Horizons This has been on display early in the year. In San Francisco, two recent blockchain conferences features some of the most influential financial technologists in the space. The first, hosted by Lighthouse Partners, featured banking names interested in the prospects of blockchain for their industry. John Bertrand gave a talk from England in which he focused on how the blockchain could bring value to the banking industry. The second, the San Francisco Blockchain Conference, brought together technology industry’s and banking industry’s minds in a discussion of the possibilities and anticipated research directions for blockchain technology. Much more than at Bitcoin conferences, Blockchain Conferences focus on how distributed systems such as blockchain will be plugged into pre-existing technology and other services, and vice versa. John Wolpert engaged the audience in a thought experiment about what individuals were seeking to do with the technology. Some expressed a desire to test the limits of smart contracts, others discussed their desires to tap the potential of blockchain in anti-money laundering. Interestingly, many people desired increased privacy. A consistent theme at the conference revolved around the notion of how the blockchain can be adapted to pre-existing banking and regulatory systems. One of the most paper-intensive duties of the the financial industry is the maintenance of know your customer and anti-money laundering databases. Many blockchainers believe this can be solved with technology inspired by Bitcoin. Nevertheless, Bitcoin was almost a bad word at the conference. Tony Vays injected a seemingly anarcho-capitalist view into the discussion. There was even a spat between Vays and Chris Kitze, where Vays argued governments were collapsing and would lose control while the free market would create freer systems. Chris Kitze argued governments had a certain agenda, and seemed capable of carrying it out for the foreseeable future. Of the spat, Kitze later told Bitcoinist.net: “I enjoyed hearing from Tone and appreciate his thoughts,” Kitze said. “In fact, I don’t disagree with most of his thoughts and I think they are entirely valid for private, non-fiat related currencies.” He clarified that Safe Cash focuses on legally compliant and very practical approaches needed by businesses that touch money. “We think Bitcoin is great and yes, we do also value freedom, privacy and people’s ability to use their private property as they see fit,” he said. The company fully supports Bitcoin payments with their Unseen project. “It’s too bad we couldn’t have a full discussion of private currencies due to time limits and it was outside the scope of this meeting,” Kitze said. “Private currencies will likely be every bit as valuable as the widespread legal tender currencies of today. Bitcoin is now widely enough used and it can be exchanged for fiat and those two factors probably move it out of the private currency realm.” The conference, overall, was considerably pitch heavy. Young startups looking for partners in the heights of technology and finance. Matt Slater detailed some of the use-cases for blockchain technology: collateral management, wherein collateral payments and margin balances for bilateral contracts are managed in real time; OTC Post-Trade Processing and Settlement, similar to the work of Overstock and t0. As Hedgy explains, this functions to “Trigger auto-settlements when terms are met or collateral is deemed insufficient.” Like Factom, Hedgy also seeks to unveil a platform for land titles and mineral rights. Kelly Olson, Intel’s Director of Distributed Ledger Technology just completed work with R3 CEV. “Intel is excited to give the R3 members the opportunity to evaluate our software in advance of its open source release,” Kelly Olson of Intel’s New Technology Group said. “Intel processor technologies like Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) provide unique capabilities that can help enable improved security and scalability for distributed ledger networks.” Ben Blair discussed Teachur.co, a way to design what might be called a smart course. The company wants to make academia more efficient, and the blockchain could be a way to do this. The blockchain could also bring academia to less fortunate countries. Teachur seeks to build lessons and courses so people can earn degrees in hours or days instead of months. They want to build a stripped down degree program to made education more cost-effective. Michael Terpin, BigAngels Chairman and bCommerce Labs managing partner, unveiled interesting information about the Satoshi Roundtable, where at, apparently while Bitcoin Core discussed they would not be interested in scaling soon, people at the conference placed buy orders for Ether, the native currency of Ethereum. The feeling of the meeting reflected a Bitcoin vs Blockchain sentiment. Chris Kitze, Safe Cash CEO, even said Bitcoin probably wasn’t a legal value transfer model. What is needed? As many participants agree, a layer for anti-money laundering and know your customer procedures. Both conferences had the feeling that a new industry has started, inspired by Bitcoin, but not beholden to the nascent digital currency.

bitcoinist	blockchain-gaming-eboost-ico	Blockchain Gaming Trend Grows as eBoost Raises $140K in ICO	2016-11-08T15:00	Gaming-specific cryptocurrency eBoost has raised over 200 bitcoins in its October crowdsale, worth around $140,000 USD at press time. Designed to be an in-game token for game integration, eBoost advertises itself as the first digital currency geared towards competitive eSports. Also read: Bitcoin Price is Moving Back up, but Fear of Bears Still Remain A Successful eBoost ICO “EBoost’s successful crowdsale is a testament to the fact the eSports and cryptocurrencies are a natural fit,” eBoost co-founder Marshall long said in a press release. After its successful ICO on the Bittrex cryptocurrency exchange, the team told press that the token should become available to trade on the same platform sometime this week. The token was designed specifically to service the competitive eSports industry, which has amassed a total wealth of $1 billion as gaming enthusiasts flock to competitions to watch professional teams go head to head in popular games. According to the press release, the token is compatible with a wide variety of gaming applications, including eSports betting in countries where gambling is legal. At the CoinAgenda conference in Las Vegas at the end of October, Long gave a presentation on eBoost, stating that the company will continue working towards expanding its presence in the industry as it secures integrations and partnerships with exchanges and eSports organizations. “Live trading on Bittrex and our upcoming integrations will make eBoost a viable and versatile payment option throughout the thriving eSports landscape,” Long told press. Blockchain Gaming: A New Trend EBoost is part of a wave of new, blockchain-based gaming platforms hitting the market with varying degrees of success. The trend started in 2014 with Gamerholic and GameCredits, two cryptocurrencies focused on the more casual side of online gaming competition. Bitcoinist reported on Gamerholic last week, the company announcing the launch of a social media service modeled after the successful Steemit platform. Posts on the new platform earn “Respeck,” Gamerholic’s version of a “Like” button or an upvote. The more Respeck a post earns, the more money it receives from the platform, much like Steemit. The company envisioned a number of uses for its platforms, including decentralized crowdfunding for online gaming tournaments. When asked about the rising prominence of similar gaming platforms, Gamerholic founder Anari Sengbe replied confidently, saying that his company’s seniority gives it a competitive edge. “We’ve been around two years, the community should be excited about this direction of social and gaming for crypto,” Sengbe said. FirstBlood has achieved the most success of the blockchain-gaming platforms thus far, securing $5.5 million USD in its crowdsale — closing out the sale on its first day within minutes. Using the Ethereum blockchain, the platform offers a decentralized method of competitive matchmaking, dispute resolution and winnings payouts, presented as an alternative over traditional platforms such as GameBattles. Since its successful fundraising campaign, FirstBlood has turned focus on its upcoming alpha release, scheduled for December of this year. So far, the team plans to support PC games exclusively, but said it will consider adding console games to the platform as development matures. EBoost, said Long at his Vegas presentation, will be announcing important partnerships in the near future, following the conclusion of the token’s ICO. What do you think about this wave of blockchain-based gaming platforms? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay, eBoost.
bitcoinist	blockchain-technology-help-london-bullion-market-association-stop-fraud-markets	Blockchain Technology Could Help The London Bullion Market Association Stop Fraud In The Markets - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-23T20:00	The London Bullion Market Association is looking into whether blockchain can reduce money laundering in the spot markets. One of the most interesting potential use cases for Bitcoin (and increasingly other cryptocurrencies) is that of a safe haven asset. When people think that the economy is going to take a turn for the worse, they’ve got a handful of options as far as what to do with their money is concerned. Cash is one, but there’s no return available on cash and, indeed, it depreciates in value over time through inflation. Equities are another, but you don’t want to be in equities when the market crashes. Precious metals are another and these are where money tends to flow in bad times – especially towards gold. Safe Haven Bitcoin The price of gold rises when the price of stocks falls. In this sense, it’s a safe haven asset, or a risk off asset as some people call it. There’s been some suggestion that bitcoin could replace gold as a safe haven asset over time, especially at the fringe of the market (i.e. the more technologically savvy individuals). Now, it seems, the gold market is looking to capitalize on the technology that underpins what many view as its primary competitor in the risk-off space – blockchain. LBMA Integration As per a recent Bloomberg report, The London Bullion Market Association, the entity in charge of the biggest market for spot gold in the world, is looking to integrate blockchain technology into its operations in an attempt to add accountability and transparency to the industry and, specifically, in an attempt to crack down on money laundering. Sakhila Mirza, who holds an executive board director position at the LBMA, said this on the plans: Blockchain cannot be ignored… Let’s understand how it can help us today, and address the risks that impact the precious metals market. This isn’t overly surprising, of course. The potential application of blockchain technology to the asset ownership and tracking use cases has long been an application touted as being a key driver behind mainstream (enterprise-level) adoption. To see an entity as large as LBMA announce an active move into the space, however, is a big deal for blockchain technology adoption as a whole. Keep in mind that this isn’t necessarily a validation of bitcoin as an asset and it’s safe to assume that the LBMA isn’t overly keen on the use of bitcoin as a risk-off/safe haven asset, but it’s a step forward for the space and one that could help ease the current negative sentiment that’s putting pressure on crypto prices across the board. What do you think about the LBMA’s potential adoption of blockchain? Can bitcoin be a valid safe haven asset? Let us know below! Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons, LBMA
bitcoinist	blockchain-will-make-biggest-difference-developing-countries	Blockchain Will Make the Biggest Difference in Developing Countries - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-28T15:00	Even though blockchain technology continues to make strides in developed countries, investment bank Exotix believes that it will have the biggest effect in emerging countries. In most cases, events develop in a step-by-step process. However, in some cases, technology allows us to bypass certain steps to get us to the end goal even quicker. Paul Domjan, who is the global head of research, analytics, and data at Exotix touched on how certain technologies have the ability to skip a few steps to present end users with a solution to their original problem, as well as a host of additional benefits. According to Business Insider, Domjan discussed how the rapid increase in smartphone usage showcases this. Having a fixed telephone line in a developed country is probably a given, but this isn’t the case in emerging countries. Instead of giving citizens in the latter the chance to experience the convenience of a landline, smartphones have instead given them the chance to experience the world from the comfort of their own palm, essentially skipping the step of having a fixed line. Blockchain Skips the Queue Domjan feels blockchain may have a similar effect in countries with emerging economies. The specialist investment bank had this to say: Today, frontier markets may be positioned to leapfrog developed economies once again, but this time the key technology is blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Even though blockchain was originally created to support cryptocurrencies, it offers huge benefits to basically any industry relying on record keeping, especially in the financial sector. Where This Technology Could Make the Most Difference However, even though blockchain is a viable option for many businesses and groups, even the United Nations, it is by no means a blanket solution, especially if efficient processes are already in place. This is more evident in developed countries than in certain developing counterparts. Domjan explained: Due its distributed nature, recording new assets on a blockchain can be quite slow, with transaction times measured in hours or even days rather than the seconds that are typical of e-commerce. As such, blockchain technology is a poor substitute for existing ownership records in developed or even emerging economies. However, some developing countries do not have any, or perhaps only have poor, structures or processes in place. In this case, blockchain technology could revolutionize certain sectors, specifically the property industry. Domjan elaborated: Whereas some emerging markets, such as Russia and China, have property registration systems on par with those in the high-income OECD countries, frontier markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia lag far behind, with average performance less than half that of the best performing economies. According to Domjan, the property sector is not the only one that can benefit from blockchain: Indeed, blockchain technology can be used to maintain a clear, reliable record of anything. For example, Estonia has implemented the BitNation public notary services, including recognizing marriages recorded in the BitNation blockchain, and Ukraine is developing an election platform based on the blockchain. Smart contracts also create an opportunity for developing countries to work more efficiently. These are automated contracts developed on the Ethereum blockchain, whereby, for example, payment is released to a certain party automatically once all of the pre-determined and agreed upon conditions are met. Even though it could work well in the case of a deed transfer, smart contracts can be used in other industries as well. Domjan explained: The same principle can be used for transactions ranging from financial derivatives to international trade. Don’t Forget About Digital Currencies Even though blockchain is so versatile, its original reason for existence can also be beneficial to these developing nations. Domjan believes that cryptocurrencies could provide a viable alternative to volatile fiat currencies in these countries: In countries with capital controls, highly volatile currencies, and high inflation, the governance problems, payments transaction costs, and volatility of their domestic currency may seem worse than those of cryptocurrencies, or at least bad enough that cryptocurrencies represent an attractive hedge against their domestic currency. We see this advantage across the developing world, from foreign investors in Brazil looking to move money, to brokers in Zimbabwe looking for an alternative store of value. Do you think that the blockchain adoption will grow in developing countries in 2018? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of AdobeStock, Pixabay
bitcoinist	blockstarter-cto-on-the-ico-boom-lots-of-people-want-to-invest-few-want-to-understand	BlockStarter CTO on the ICO Boom: Lots of People Want to Invest, Few Want to Understand - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-08T21:15	These days, the ICO market is booming. Companies come up with more and more synonyms for this notion: crowdsale, token sale, contribution campaign, and so forth. Even those who have never been related to cryptocurrency, let alone invested therein, weigh on launching a token sale for different purposes. The market is still expanding, and most new ICO’s, whatever they are called, use Ethereum-based solutions to issue their tokens and roll out smart contracts. Some companies hire blockchain / smart contracts experts to close the conceptual and technological gap, others attempt to do everything themselves, and some others even hire specialized companies to develop a customized solution for their purposes. The hype around ICO’s has not subsided even after the notorious SEC decree that bans all such campaigns in case they don’t meet their requirements. Bitcoinist talked with Andrei Stehno, CTO and co-founder of Blockstarter, the company developing a comprehensive platform that enables anyone to create and hold an ICO. There is some scarcity of such solutions on the market right now, so they hope their solution would be of use. Bitcoinist: Is Blockstarter some sort of an ICO lego? How did you come up with this idea? AS: I wouldn’t say it’s really a lego, but it’s an erector set all right. Our solution doesn’t require some in-depth knowledge of crypto technologies or smart contracts to issue a token or generate a contract. It’s not that difficult to use a regular computer interface, and lots of people do that without knowing the internal workings of a machine. It doesn’t require them to have a profound knowledge of software engineering, or any knowledge at all for that matter. Our concept mainly seeks to do the same for token sale campaigns. If you analyze the entire process sequentially, you can understand how to make everything way simpler. You just need to create a comprehensible and manageable interface for an average computer user who knows the ideology but is not that tech-savvy. The need for such an interface doesn’t pertain solely to ICO’s. That’s the common problem of the entire cryptocurrency industry. That is one of the reasons why it still can’t reach the general public. Bitcoinist: So you think such a solution will be demanded? AS: We think it’s more than a demand, it’s actually needed. Take a look at announcements of ICO’s these days. Literally, thousands of new campaigns kick off every week. And it’s a truly rare occasion when they don’t use an ERC20 token or some other Ethereum-based solutions. Bitcoinist: So, in fact, you’ll enable anyone to hold a token sale? Aren’t you afraid your solution will become a dreamboat for scammers of all sorts? AS: We can argue a lot as to whether one needs to raise money in order to raise more money over a token sale later. What goes without any doubt is that none of those ‘raisers’ have a readily scalable solution. We’ve got the solution, but we’re not ready to roll it out straight away. We’ll hold a few token sales on our engine to create a proof of concept. When it goes far and wide, the solution will be as flexible as possible. Of course, there’s always a risk of a scam. But, what is good, most projects try to heed the risks of dishonest ICO’s flooding the market. The recent paper by the SEC and the halt of Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges make it clear that just one major scam can disrupt the entire progress. Lots of really good projects will become impossible again, in that case, everyone knows that. Bitcoinist: What do you think about so-called boxed ICO solutions? AS: It just means that some agency completely covers literally all needs of a project, including development and marketing. Frankly, it’s a really weird idea, and it has something to do with your previous question. A good honest project wouldn’t want a boxed solution. To me, it’s fairly obvious that if someone hires a group of professionals to hold an ICO, they’re not really interested in actually delivering the product they had promised. They are interested in raising funds, and that’s it. This approach has no future. Bitcoinist: What’s a good project then? AS: It’s a group of devoted enthusiasts. Their primary goal is to deliver a product that can actually work and change the world for the better. They raise money to deliver it, and in best case scenario they will make money out of a working solution, not some unhealthy and artificially induced hype. A good project seeks to tackle a problem that lies on the surface, and everyone is aware of. What makes it good is that no-one before them could come up with a working solution. Of course, it’s not just about that. A circumspect economy is also a good project’s feature. A great blockchain project is, first of all, a great economic system. It has to work like clockwork. It has to be described in the clearest possible terms. Everyone should see where’s demand and where’s supply. Lots of projects we know of can’t stand up to this test, and it’s a shame. Lots of people want to invest, lots of people want to develop, but only a few want to understand. That’s why there’s such a great demand for expert opinions. That’s why the institution of advisers is blooming now. And that is why it’s so important to give transparent and comprehensible instruments to the community, so that good projects would do their job, and scammers would wither into oblivion. Bitcoinist: So, you claim that your project is a good one? AS: Who would think that they work on a bad project after all? It all comes to the motivation of the team. I like our motivation: we’re creating a solution that could help others. Motivation is an important thing when it comes to the matters of survival. It’s rational, after all: if you want just to raise money, it’s much easier to go and buy an island once your campaign is over. A working solution won’t buy you an island, it will buy you a future. And to me, it’s way better. Bitcoinist: Are you going to introduce some rules and frameworks? It all sounds great, but I can’t help thinking about some bad guys fooling everyone. AS: Of course, some rules are required. If you take a look at some notable ICO’s of the past, you’ll see that most of those companies were self-regulated. Say, if a project doesn’t say a word as to some financial guarantees regarding their product’s future development, a reasonable contributor would think twice before buying their tokens. Some projects pay salaries with their tokens. Waves, for example, couldn’t access their funds until they rolled out their testnet. So, it is a matter of trust after all. Nobody forced them to impose such restrictions on themselves, but they still did. And look at them now! The industry tends to rely on crowd wisdom as well. But it has certain challenges: Bitcointalk, for instance, is obsolete, it’s inconvenient and mobile-hostile. Reddit isn’t focused on the crypto community whatsoever. Ethereum should be more scalable and include some incentive for projects to be completely honest. Bitcoinist: So, are you still waiting for some technological advancements to occur in this area? AS: Of course, there are numerous issues that the general public doesn’t know or doesn’t want to know about. If a major project holds a token sale these days, the Ethereum network goes down. But we still believe that Ethereum is the best technology for scalable solutions there is. Their team is working hard on that: they’ve delivered a developer preview for Raiden Network, they’re working on sharding, they’re testing atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. So, frankly, I admire their devotion. Bitcoinist: What does the industry’s future look like for you? AS: The future is reserved for services that can effectively harness the power of smart contracts and create infrastructures that reinforce Ethereum capabilities and other platforms for token issuance. Some of them, like Waves or BitShares, are yet to be fully appreciated, so I think we’ll see more projects putting their options to a good use. It will provide for long-term growth of the entire cryptoeconomy, not just Ethereum. It will allow projects to focus on their product, not their crowdsale, and it’s actually one of the best things that could happen to them. Users, on the other hand, will enjoy an easier understanding of any project’s essence, and therefore they’ll be able to mitigate or completely avoid some of the most dreaded risks. People will start looking deeper into the problem. With the important opinions and information in place, it will be really great. The future is no bed of roses, of course, but I’m confident it’s mature, reasonable, and transparent.

bitcoinist	bobby-lee-defiant-against-china-expects-bitcoin-to-hit-100000-in-2018	Bobby Lee Defiant Against China, Expects Bitcoin to Hit $100,000 in 2018 - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-11T03:30	Bitcoin China chief executive Bobby Lee remains defiant in the face of the Chinese government, saying that Bitcoin will continue to thrive and go up in value. It’s always refreshing to come across a person who remains unbowed in the face of stiff opposition. One such person is Bobby Lee, the chief executive of Bitcoin China, the longest-running Bitcoin exchange in the world until it was shut down by the People’s Bank of China. Despite this, Bobby Lee remains defiant against the authorities in China by staying extremely optimistic on the future of Bitcoin. Not Backing Down On the same day that the People’s Daily, the media outlet for the Communist Party in China, said that cryptocurrency was a bubble, Bobby Lee was saying different to the Foreign Correspondents Club (FCC). Lee remained defiant against Chinese regulators concerning Bitcoin and vigorously defended the cryptocurrency by stating: Chinese are crazy about bitcoin because they love speculation, investment and making money. My advice to Hong Kong investors is to hold at least one percent of their assets in it, in the interests of diversifying their assets. Hong Kong is better than China, because you have no foreign exchange controls. Bullish on Bitcoin’s Future In spite of China’s actions against virtual currency, Lee remains extremely optimistic on the future of Bitcoin. He told the FCC that Bitcoin would reach a price of $100,000 in this year and would soar to $150,000 by 2021. As for why Bitcoin will continue to go up, Lee says: The reason that it will go up is the inherent failures and limitation of the world’s monetary authorities. There is only a fixed amount that will be issued, 21 million. Currently, there are 16.5 million outstanding, with one-two million being added each year. Such a fixed amount is unique, and different to currencies controlled by governments, which can issue more when they wish. Bitcoin is the first system of currency not regulated by governments or companies which can control how you spend it, even if it is, in theory, ‘your own money’. Even though Bitcoin China is out of the crypto exchange business, Lee says that the company has forged ahead into other areas, such as MOBI and B2B. He concluded his remarks to the FCC by reiterating his unbridled support for Bitcoin, despite what Chinese authorities are doing against crypto, by saying: Let me give you the four mistakes in investing in bitcoin – be indecisive and wait to invest, do not buy enough, sell after making a small gain, sell after a panic crash … It is a new asset class and is meant to equal gold. What do you think about Bobby Lee standing firmly behind Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Bitcoinist archives and Shutterstock.
bitcoinist	bonanza-bubble-insulate-bitcoin-price-volatility	Bonanza or Bubble? Insulate Yourself From Bitcoin Price Volatility - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-24T17:30	As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to languish far below its December high of around $20,000, speculation is rife as to whether this is the sound of the bubble bursting. The incredible recent volatility in BTC prices has in no way diminished the interest of investors, who are pondering what 2018 has in store for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. Can it repeat 2017’s astonishing return? Are recent price swings based on the cryptocurrency’s actual utility and value? Or are they, rather, the result of speculators jumping in and out for quick profits in an overheated market that, in fact, needs to cool off? Mike Novogratz, a billionaire former hedge-fund manager who left his position with Fortress Investment Group to start a $500m cryptocurrency investment fund, believes bitcoin is “the biggest bubble of our lifetimes”, as he recently told Bloomberg. “Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.” Now, if you are a savvy trader who thrives in an increasingly volatile market, then this is just the news you’ll want to hear. But what should you do if you are just starting out or don’t have the time or expertise to carefully follow and capitalize on every bitcoin price swing? A crowdfunded bitcoin mining project called Miner One could be the answer. By mining bitcoin with Miner One instead of simply buying it outright, you insulate yourself from these increasingly wild market fluctuations and enjoy much steadier returns. Nobody can say whether it will still be possible to achieve returns like last year’s by simply speculating in bitcoin. And will you be able to “time the market” as it fluctuates? Think about this: if you bought bitcoin at $20,000 just one month ago, as things stand today, you will have lost more than $10,000. On the other hand, whether a bitcoin is worth $10,000 or $20,000, if you have mined it, you are still making money – without all the stress of having to follow the ups and downs of the market 24/7. Check out the Miner One calculator, which shows you how much. And, unlike that miner in your basement or garage, Miner One is top-of-the-line hardware in a safe and secure facility set up and managed by industry experts with access to ultra-low-cost electricity. “We have access to the lowest industrial electricity rates in Europe: only 0.065 per kWh,” says Miner One CEO Pranas Slusnys, who has decades of experience in the data center industry. “If profitable crypto-mining is your goal, Miner One offers optimal conditions.” Join the cryptocurrency revolution. The Miner One ICO starts February 15. For more information, please visit minerone.io. What are your thoughts on the Miner One platform? Do you plan to participate in the ICO? Why or why not?

bitcoinist	bosch-group-investing-iota	The Bosch Group Is Investing in IOTA - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-21T07:30	IOTA is a cryptocurrency that focuses on providing secure payments and data transactions among machines, particularly, in the realm of the Internet of Things. In the past few weeks, IOTA’s value has skyrocketed by 400 percent. Now, IOTA’s prospects look even brighter, as Robert Bosch Venture Capital announced that it is investing in IOTA. Robert Bosch Ventura Capital to Industrialize IOTA Technology The Stuttgart-based Robert Bosch Venture Capital (RBVC), the corporate venture capital company of the Bosch Group, is joining forces with the IOTA Foundation, which is the central body of the altcoin. In this regard, RBVC announced that it had purchased a significant number of IOTA tokens. Dr. Ingo Ramesohl, Managing Director at RBVC, said : The investment in IOTA’s token, the first ever token investment of RBVC, will help us working closely with the IOTA Foundation to explore the industrialization of this exciting technology. IOTA teams and the Bosch Group have been in contact since 2015, working on several projects. David Sønstebø, co-founder of IOTA, said: The decision by RBVC to acquire a significant amount of IOTA tokens solidifies the idea of the Machine Economy and how significant leaders in this space share our vision. The RBVC investment follows the release of the Data Marketplace last November. The Data Marketplace allows users to store, sell, and access data streams securely. According to the IOTA Foundation, over 30 companies are participating in the Data Marketplace project, such as Accenture, Bosch, Fujitsu, and Microsoft. IOTA Introduces a Technology Paradigm Shift IOTA’s revolutionary technology’s primary focus is on enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IOTA promises unlimited scalability and feeless micro or even nano-transactions. In the IOTA ecosystem, there is no blockchain. Instead, there is the tangle, which is a directed acyclic graph for storing transactions. Because there are no blocks and no miners, validation of transactions occurs as follows : There are no miners. What this means is that each participant in the network that wants to make a transaction has to actively participate in the consensus of the network by approving two past transactions. This attestation on the validity of two past transactions ensures that the whole network achieves consensus on the current state of approved transactions, and it enables a variety of unique features that are only seen in IOTA. For further technical information, you may wish to read the IOTA whitepaper here. After just a few months, IOTA already boasts a market cap of over $14 billion USD. IOTA is introducing a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and as reflected by the markets, it is attracting investors and enthusiasts on the idea of the Machine Economy. The RBVC investment will undoubtedly help to boost the development of this revolutionary technology. What are your thoughts about having crypto transactions that are not validated by miners?

bitcoinist	btcpay-core-developer-better-bitpay	BTCPay: Meet the Core Developer Who's Building a Better 'BitPay'	2017-12-27T12:30	Bitcoinist spoke with Bitcoin Core developer Nicolas Dorier who explains why BTCPay is not only a cheaper alternative to BitPay but also provides merchants and users with more control over their funds. What is BTCPay? BTCPay Server is an open-source payment processor that conforms to the invoice API of Bitpay. This allows easy migration of your code base to your own self-hosted payment processor. According to BTCPay, the service would be a good choice for you if: You currently use Bitpay as a payment processor but worry about their commitment to Bitcoin in the future; You want to be in control of your own funds; Bitpay compliance team decided to reject your application; You want lower fees (we support Segwit ); You want to become a payment processor yourself and offer BTCPay-hosted solution to merchants; You want to support another currency than those offered by Bitpay. Bitcoin itself is decentralized, but payment processors are not […]. BTCPay is a way out. Bitcoinist: What is BTCPay? Is it open-source and how much does it cost? Nicolas Dorier (ND): BTCPay is multi-tenant open-source payment processor, backward compatible with Bitpay API. It means that it is a payment processor which can be used to provide payment processing to multiple merchants. The cost depends on what you choose to host it (can be hosted by any by linux or windows). A typical cloud hosting (AWS or Azure) should be around $20 USD of computing power per month and $40 USD of storage (mainly for the blockchain) per month. The $40 USD of storage will drop significantly to around $5 USD with Jonas Schnelli work on BIP159 (NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED). One install can support multiple merchants and multiple stores. I created a one-click install for Azure users. Bitcoinist: Why did you decide to work on this project? ND: During the B2X debacle, Bitpay decided to force its customers to follow B2X chain. I advised lots of people to use Bitpay (and Copay) in the past. And those merchants were definitively not happy with Bitpay making the decision on what their businesses will consider to be Bitcoin. Since then, we again saw Bitpay acting against the interest of its merchants by not migrating to segwit (externalizing this cost as “Network Fee” to their merchants) and temporarily raising the minimum invoice to $100 USD suddenly. Bitcoin itself is decentralized, but payment processors are not, and they use their comfortable position to abuse its customers. BTCPay is a way out. Bitcoinist: What are the biggest differences between BTCPay and BitPay? ND: BTCPay can be hosted by yourself. This means that you are in control of the full node. Nobody can force you about what version of Bitcoin to accept. The API of BTCPay is exactly the same as Bitpay (outside of the URL where to send the invoice requests). It makes migration from Bitpay easy. BTCPay can easily fork all open-source plugins developed by Bitpay or its community and adapt them with minimum change to work with BTCPay. This is what we did for Woocommerce plugin. Other plugins will be supported on demand. We will probably not support BCH (except if BCH community makes a clean, TESTED pull request). Litecoin will soon be supported. Changelly integration is on the roadmap. It will be possible to pay an invoice in several cryptocurrencies. Lightning Network is on the roadmap as well. BTCPay will use an “x/zpub” to generate invoice addresses. This can be retrieved from your own Electrum wallets, Trezor or Ledger easily. BTCPay never has access to the funds of your wallet and does not require it to be online, it can only generate addresses. Because BTCPay is open-source and self-hosted, there is no support for fiat conversion at the moment. However, there is a plan for support of a standard to allow any exchange to become fiat provider to a BTCPay merchant through the COX protocol. I saw lots of interest among some exchanges about this idea. Bitcoinist: Can anyone just use the code to process their own payments and avoid BitPay? ND: Yes, BTCPay is entirely open-source. Unless you need fiat conversion, you can bypass BitPay. (If you need fiat conversion, see above about the COX protocol in the roadmap.) Bitcoinist: Why should merchants choose BTCPay over legacy processors? ND: Because other open-source payment processors seriously suck and do not work. Some merchants migrating to BTCPay already tried the other alternatives thinking they were more mature…no. One may use another centralized payment processor, but will likely put their business at the mercy of arbitrary decisions once again. Bitcoinist: How tech-savvy do merchants have to be? Must they download the source code or is there an option to sign up for a hosted service? ND: If the merchant is tech savvy, he can host by himself. If he is a bit tech savvy but not too much, he can host by himself via the one-click deploy on Azure. If the merchant is not at all tech savvy, a third party would be able to host a BTCPay instance and make merchants pay for using the service monthly. (I might do that myself for free if nobody does.) One BTCPay instance can host multiple merchants with multiple stores, so the host is not necessarily the merchant himself. Bitcoinist: How much interest have you received from merchants so far? ND: Quite a lot of questions about this new service, and some who already jumped ship and use it in production like cryptoasylum.com (and soon coincards.ca). I developed Bitpay integrations for customers in the past; I am slowly migrating them (eating my own dog food.) My “thumb in the wind” estimation of the current volume is between 10 and 50 invoices per day; double next month. Lot’s on interest coming from Litecoin community, so I think new merchants will jump the ship soon. And even more once Lightning Network is supported. Bitcoinist: Would such a service mitigate fees, given the recent sharp rise in Bitcoin tx costs recently? ND: Yes it will. The service supports segwit, saving around 40% of fee per transaction. Second, Bitpay considers an invoice “invalid” after 1H if not confirmed. This means the buyer need to add large fees or the invoice will be canceled, which need even more transaction to refund the customer. BTCPay lets the merchant decide. The merchant will see the invoice as “paid” when receiving the unconfirmed transaction. The invoice will be “confirmed” after 1 or 6 confirmations (merchant setting). If the first confirmation takes too much time to come, the invoice will become “invalid” after whatever timeout the merchant wants to configure. Bitcoinist: Why did you decide to support Litecoin as well? ND: I work on Litecoin as merchants need an alternative before Lightning is ready. Litecoin has a competent development team and shorter confirmation time making it attractive for small payment on-chain. It also supports Segwit, meaning some interesting scenarios will be possible once I add Lightning Network support. Like cross atomic swap between merchants so they can accept Bitcoin payment, but receive Litecoin instead without passing by an exchange. I am not against supporting other altcoins (BCH included), given they are smart enough to look at how Litecoin support is implemented as an example and do the same for themselves. I will not work on it directly, but I would need to the guess the next altcoin after Litecoin to be supported by BTCPay, it might be Stratis: they have a team very familiar with NBitcoin and.NET Core development, this is likely a 2-3 days worth of work for them. I will also work on Changelly integration so that any currency supported by Changelly will be supported indirectly by BTCPay. Bitcoinist: What kind of benefits would Lightning Network integration bring to payment processing? ND: Lightning Network will provide instant transactions nearly for free. This unlocks interesting things like instant cross atomic swaps. So the merchant can instantly exchange his LTC against BTC upon receiving the invoice. In the case of integration to exchanges, it means that a merchant can propose BTC payment to his customer, and immediately sending part of his BTC on an exchange and place a market sell order. Most of the volatility risk disappear as the time between when the payment is received and the sell order is placed is near zero. The only volatility risk remaining is between the creation of the invoice and its payment. The 15 min in Bitpay will be configurable in BTCPay. All of that without any trusted third party holding his cryptocurrency. This is quite exciting. Bitcoinist: Thanks for your insight. Anything you would like to add? ND: Thanks to DG Lab and Metaco, which support my work on BTCPay. Thanks to my girlfriend for the awesome design. Thanks to the community and support everybody show. Thanks to Bitcoin for taking care of me.

bitcoinist	bu-critical-bug-millions-fork	BU Critical Bug 'Damage Would Have Been in the Millions' During Fork	2017-03-15T05:00	As attackers exploited a bug that crashed 50% of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes Tuesday, the industry reacted saying its developers had a lucky financial escape. BU ‘Vulnerability’ Bug The attack occurred around half an hour after Bitcoin Unlimited was uploaded to Github, with nodes completely shutting down to the point where over half the network was no longer operating. As BU’s main proponent Roger Ver tried to salvage the situation, users reacted harshly, Ver having only a week ago launched his own dedicated BU mining pool. “Normally, in Bitcoin Unlimited when we find a Core bug we just fix it and move on,” he tweeted quoting a blog post from developer Andrew Stone. "Normally, in Bitcoin Unlimited when we find a Core bug we just fix it and move on" https://t.co/cqQaIm5FZJ — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) March 14, 2017 Entrepreneur Andrew Milne meanwhile commented that had BU been its own altcoin, something mooted as a possibility in the event of a Bitcoin hard fork, the value of coins “would have dropped 50-70%.” IMO, the value of Bitcoin Unlimited coins ($BTU) would have dropped 50-70% yesterday, probably recovering half of that when patched — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) March 15, 2017 2 Critical Bugs Still At Large? One node operator described the bug as “plain incompetence” and questioned the possibility of further bugs occurring, something which rumors from Core developers later supported. “Based on what [Gregory Maxwell] said and what some people are whispering. 2 other critical bugs in BU yet to be fixed,” a Twitter response to Core developer Peter Todd’s reaction reads. Todd had taken to social media to remove himself from suspicion surrounding the attack, stating he “had nothing to do with” what happened. @petertoddbtc based on what gmaxwell said and what some people are whispering. 2 other critical bugs in BU yet to be fixed. Jeezus. — Avatar X (@AvatarX) March 15, 2017 Further reactions were predictable in light of the bitter debate between BU and Core supporters, which has now dragged on for almost two years. More rumors were accompanied by criticism of BU developers from prominent cryptocurrency figures, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee reproducing alleged evidence of Stone’s vulnerability overview not being mathematically sound. “We have… chosen to follow responsible disclosure procedures even though so far the negative effects of this attack have been minimal,” Stone also wrote in an initial statement about the problem. He requested the community to “limit the communication of this issue to miners, Bitcoin enterprises, and client developers until patches are available and upgrades complete.” Not The First Time, Not The Last? Containment measures, which involved a four-hour ban for any node sending suspicious behavior, appears meanwhile to be semi-successful, node numbers having risen from a low of 410 to 543. Bitcoin Core node numbers jumped considerably at the same time. The latest fiasco is in fact the second BU bug, Stone having previously told Bitcoinist in January how a previous setback “was caused by a miscounting of the bytes in the coinbase.” Ever level-headed, Andreas Antonopoulos surmised that “individual incompetence” was not to blame for BU’s misfortunes. “It’s about a process with diverse and laborious review, which catches bugs before production,” he said, while stressing that there was little economical impact this time before a potential hard fork. “During a fork, the damage would have been in the millions,” Antonopoulos noted. “QA [quality assurance] matters.” BU has shipped an exploitable bug on a code base that is 0.001 of the size of Core's. That's several orders of magnitude worse QA process — Andreas (@aantonop) March 15, 2017 What do you think about the Bitcoin Unlimited bugs? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	canada-no-tax-changes-bitcoin-govt-unveils-blockchain-id-scheme	Canada: 'No Tax Changes' For Bitcoin As Govt. Unveils Blockchain ID Scheme	2018-01-29T10:15	Canada has unveiled a government Blockchain identity prototype while declining to change Bitcoin tax rules at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2018. ‘We Don’t Plan Any Overhaul’ – Finance Minister As multiple sources report Monday, the country’s finance minister, Bill Morneau, said the government “has no plans” to change tack on how cryptocurrency is treated under Canadian tax law. “We don’t have any specific Bitcoin or cryptocurrency overhaul,” he told Bloomberg on the fringes of the event. The comments contrast with those of central bank chief Stephen S. Poloz, who, in a presentation in December, called Bitcoin one of the things that “keeps him awake at night” and cautioned on investment. Instead of cementing hard-and-fast tax regulation in line with countries such as South Korea this month, Morneau allied his view with those of UK prime minister Theresa May and US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, both of whom focused on illicit Bitcoin usage concerns at the WEF last week. Morneau committed to “making sure that we understand what’s going on underneath that market, to make sure that we aren’t introducing any risks into our economy, whether they be risks like money laundering or terrorist financing.” Canada Goes Blockchain For Air Travel At the same time, the government used the Davos event to formally announce its Blockchain-based traveller ID scheme in partnership with Accenture. Known as “Known Traveller Digital Identity,” the scheme “utilises biometrics, cryptography and distributed ledger technology to give travellers control over, and the ability to share their information with authorities in advance of travel for expedited clearance,” an official press release states. While still prior to mainstream implementation, a “proof of concept pilot” between two countries is the next step in its road to adoption, that phase being run in conjunction with the Netherlands. Canada’s minister of transport, Marc Garneau, commented: Innovation is key to enhancing global competitiveness, mobility and productivity. Leveraging new technological advancements can support risk-based approaches to public safety and security, making air travel more efficient while improving the travel experience.

bitcoinist	cappasity-says-parity-bug-hack	Ethereum Funds Frozen, Token Startup Cappasity Says Bug Was "Hack"	2017-11-11T17:30	In a new development suggesting Parity’ recent flaw that locked up over 900,000 ether was more nefarious than previously thought, affected token startup Cappasity thinks they have proof the “bug” was actually a hack. Cappasity Thinks Foul Play’s Been Discovered The Ethereum community was rocked on Tuesday, November 7, after GitHub user devops199 deleted the library responsible for supporting approximately $300 million dollars’ worth of ether in Ethereum wallet provider Parity’s multi-signature wallets. The space was flabbergasted by the curious nature of the incident, as devops199 immediately posted on the Parity GitHub after the library’s deletion to declare he’d mistakenly killed the library in question. In comments immediately after the lock-up, devops199 suggested he had little experience with Ethereum and that his deletion was the result of incompetence. But according to Cappasity – a token start-up that’s lost access to 3,264 ether in the ongoing Parity nightmare – devops199 is only feigning incompetence. The 3D Virtual Reality upstart firm points to recent investigative developments in the case that suggest devops199 was considerably more competent than he was letting on. For example, Cappasity notes devops199’s previously undisclosed attempts to commandeer ownership over the Polkadot and ARtokens (ART) smart contracts. 'By studying devops199's attempts to extract and change ownership of #ARToken ’s and @polkadotnetwork ’s smart contracts, it appears the user was maliciously poking around, eventually triggering the catastrophic bug in Parity's software' @cappasity https://t.co/0QAEAxygYh — Cappasity Inc. (@cappasity) November 11, 2017 These kinds of maneuverings belie an advanced, or at least novice, understanding of smart contracts. In a statement on Cappasity’s findings, company CEO Kosta Popov even went so far as to say that law enforcement officials may soon need to be involved: When you are tracking [devops199’s] transactions, you realize that they were deliberate […] Therefore, we tend to think that it was not an accident. We suppose that this was a deliberate hacking. We believe that if the situation is not successfully resolved in the nearest future, contacting law enforcement agencies may be the right next step. Fix and Timeline for the Parity Flaw Uncertain For now, the unusual nature of the ongoing Parity “bug” has everyone in the community wondering what’s next. It remains to be seen what fix can be implemented to return the affected users’ 900,000 ether. Some in the community have wondered if a hard fork of Ethereum will be necessary to make these users whole, but in an email exchange with the author of this article, Ethereum Foundation’s External Relations lead John Frazer made it clear the Foundation hasn’t “taken this position in any form.” Indeed, echoing this sentiment, Ethereum Foundation Security lead Martin Swende expressed during recent comments to the press that the fix should be “spearheaded by the affected parties.” This means its Parity’s time to shine – the way they handle this crisis in the coming days and weeks will likely determine if the users stick with the wallet service or potentially abandon it in droves. https://t.co/ZFWoet0I6D We are running the crowdsale in regular mode. The incident in no way affects our commitment to release ARtokens. — Cappasity Inc. (@cappasity) November 9, 2017 What’s clear is that this black swan event means the Parity team surely has a long, difficult road ahead of them. Where do you stand? Do you think Parity’s going to be able to return these 900,000 ether to their rightful owners? Let us know what you think in the comments below! Image courtesy of Quartz
bitcoinist	casinos-first-killer-blockchain-app	Casinos: The First Killer Blockchain App? - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-26T15:00	If you’re wondering what the first killer blockchain-based app is going to be, look no further than casinos. CyptoKitties gained flash-in-the-pan media attention a month ago – and though eventually there is likely to be a thriving market for crypto-collectibles – the application that is more likely to have a bigger impact this year is the casino. Blockchain-based gambling has in fact been quietly building steam since the early days of crypto. Proof of concept came when the ability to generate provably fair random events on the Bitcoin protocol spawned Satoshi Dice way back in April 2012. The site was an almost instant success, earning the equivalent of $50,000/month in transaction fees before being sold in 2013 for 126,315 BTC. The blockchain can deliver the entire experience – KYC, billing, bet accepting & processing together with the generation of the betting event – the random number. This trusted automated process is delivering what the customer wants. A streamlined process that cannot be cheated by the house or the player. The player can bet knowing that the house has the funds in place to pay out big jackpots. Open ledgers can reduce the need for customer service. Provably fair random events are a big deal because now – for the first time ever in casino gambling – we can know beyond the shadow of a doubt that we are not getting cheated by the house. Blockchain has made online casinos indisputably transparent once and for all. But, as we have seen with the excruciatingly slow adoption of for example electric vehicles, for a newcomer to meaningfully displace the incumbent, it must be better than the incumbent in every way. Satoshi Dice was revolutionary as a proof of concept but its painfully simple interface and the lag-time caused by Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time meant that it was only ever adopted among crypto evangelists and gambling purists. Nowadays, due to the high transactions fees, gambling directly on the Bitcoin network only makes sense for huge bets. For blockchain based casino gambling to truly replace the incumbents, drastic improvements were needed. As we all know, 2017 saw an explosion of projects raising huge amounts of money to develop new platforms. In the blockchain casino sector, FunFair – the biggest player by market cap in the sector – raised the equivalent of $26 million in its ICO. Other projects in the space include MBit, Dao Casino, and Edgeless. All of these projects improve upon Satoshi Dice in a few ways. First of all, transaction times are lowered from minutes to seconds. Next, transaction fees are reduced to the equivalent of pennies. Finally, and perhaps most important of all, odds for players are dramatically improved. By decentralizing operators (the house), risks taken by accepting large bets can be distributed across a pool of operators, removing the need for a huge initial investment to be made by a single entity and all of the costs associated with securing that investment. This, in addition to the fact that no central office or costly centralized servers are needed, allows the “house” to operate at a much-reduced margin. All of this means that blockchain-based casinos are now cheaper, faster, more secure, and fairer than legacy online casinos. The final piece of the puzzle is user experience. For mainstream casino gamblers to really make the transition to a blockchain-based casino, the experience better be entertaining as well. We must remember that gambling, for most people, is just for fun. The user experience that players have come to expect was never going to be built by the creators of Satoshi Dice. Those developers paved the way by building the foundations that make blockchain-based casinos superior to legacy casinos in almost every way, but to finish the puzzle, seasoned casino professionals were needed. In 2018 those professionals are bringing the skills they have developed over decades of providing an entertaining casino gambling experience and deploying that experience on top of the blockchain architecture developed over the last several years. 2018, therefore, will see real adoption of blockchain-based casinos and while several projects are likely to onboard large numbers of users, RealCasino.io is one project that is very well positioned. With over a decade experience bringing the live online casino experience with entertaining storylines and professional sets, RealCasino is already a master at providing the entertainment casino gamblers seek and expect. RealCasino already has a Live MVP you can demo right now. And they just added a Live Keno demo, in addition to their suite of high production, story-rich roulette and spin-to-win games running entirely on the blockchain. RealCasino is holding a token generation event to kick-start its network. The pre-sale, which offers a 30% bonus, begins on February 10th.

bitcoinist	cedex-first-certified-blockchain-based-diamond-exchange	CEDEX: The First Certified Blockchain-based Diamond Exchange - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-20T15:00	They may be a girl’s best friend, but diamond dealers and investors are going to love CEDEX, the first certified diamond exchange to be built using blockchain technology. The diamond market has an estimated turnover of $80 billion per year, yet investor demand accounts for only 5% of that – the rest is consumer demand from the jewelry industry. Historically, diamonds have been a consistent store of value, just like gold and other precious metals, so why aren’t more investors looking at diamonds as an investment vehicle? Despite their total market value, diamonds are not considered a financial asset class and, as such, there is no established market for their trade, unlike traditional commodities. CEDEX aims to change all of that with the launch of the first certified blockchain-based exchange that will tokenize and transform diamonds into a tradeable asset. Removing the Barriers to Entry for Diamond Investing The CEDEX platform removes the three major issues facing the diamond market that have kept it from being a viable alternative investment class – lack of transparency, lack of liquidity, and lack of standardization. Lack of Transparency The diamond industry is plagued by obfuscation, both deliberate and unintentional. A lack of clear and transparent pricing, coupled with markups, list prices, and a “closed shop” mentality makes it very difficult for the average investor to understand how a diamond is valued and how to gauge its worth. CEDEX uses a proprietary machine learning algorithm called DEX that rates a diamond’s asking price by taking into account the stone’s gem composite (GIA), parallel trades, and market trends. The result is an objective market value, that doesn’t require investors to be diamond experts to understand. Lack of Liquidity The basis of any commodities market is an asset’s liquidity – that is, the ability to buy an asset and then sell it at some point in the future at a gain. The diamond market is decidedly illiquid. Most diamonds are sold to consumers in one-sided transactions and places anyone wishing to resell their stones at a severe disadvantage. The way the market is currently structured, consumers wishing to resell their diamonds never realize a gain on their initial purchase. They are forced to sell at a loss, often as much as 50%. CEDEX addresses the liquidity issue through the tokenization of the diamonds on its platform. Diamond dealers and private sellers have more options with regards to selling their stones the barrier to entry for investing is much lower so more people will be able to invest in diamonds than ever before. Lack of Standardization When someone invests in gold, they are investing in a standardized, fungible asset. An ounce of gold is an ounce of gold – there is no deviation in composition or value between ounces. Diamonds are a different story – no two stones are alike, making it difficult to establish a standardized valuation. The CEDEX platform creates a single benchmark for each diamond category so that buyers and sellers can easily see how one diamond rates against other stones in the same category. CEDEX Token Offering The CEDEX token offering will take place in two stages – the pre-sale and the main sale. There is a total token supply of 100 million CEDEX Coins, of which 50 million is being offered to the public – up to 10 million tokens during the pre-sale and the remainder during the main sale. The pre-sale will take place on January 12, 2018, at 19:00 GMT and last for ten days or until all 10 million tokens have been sold, whichever comes first. Any tokens not sold during the pre-sale will be added to the main sale’s token supply. The start date of the main sale will be determined by the pre-sale’s performance. If the pre-sale is completed within the first 24 hours, that is, if all 10 million tokens are sold during that period, then the main sale will begin on January 13, 2018, at 19:00 GMT. Otherwise, the main sale will begin at 19:00 GMT on February 9, 2018. In either case, the main sale will last for 28 days or until the maximum cap is reached. Investors will be able to purchase CEDEX Coins using Ether, Bitcoin, or fiat currencies. During the token sale, CEDEX Coins will be sold at a rate of 1 ETH = 500 CEDEX Coins. The token supply will be created during the token sale and distributed upon its completion. Any tokens offered for sale to the public that are not sold will be burned (destroyed). Participants in the token sale will receive the following special bonuses: Pre-sale: Buyers of the first 10% of available tokens will receive 0.3 CEDEX Coins for every CEDEX Coin purchased; First day of main sale: Buyers of the first 40% of available tokens will receive 0.15 CEDEX Coins for every CEDEX Coin purchased. For more information please visit the CEDEX website. There you can download the project white paper, register for the pre-sale, and learn about the CEDEX platform.

bitcoinist	centralized-nick-szabo-bitcoin-cash	'Bitcoin Cash is Centralized Sock Puppetry' - Bitcoin Pioneer Nick Szabo	2017-12-22T07:30	Pioneering Bitcoin developer Nick Szabo has described Bitcoin Cash (BCash) as “centralized sock puppetry” as analysts voice concern over its network. Alibaba Hosts 54% Of BCash Nodes Retweeting findings by software architect Sondre Bjellås, Szabo, who is considered one of the most likely candidates to have created Bitcoin, was candid in his opinion of the controversial Bitcoin hard fork. "Bitcoin Cash" is centralized sock puppetry. https://t.co/OJJo5vwEfn — Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) December 21, 2017 BCash has embarked on a marketing effort to attract investment on a huge scale this month, with promotional activities by Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver in particular gaining notoriety as he entered the mainstream press. Bizarre social media activity from CNBC, the network Ver had spoken to twice about BCash, cemented suspicions of foul play and even collusion between staff, BCash representatives and Ver himself. Despite Ver’s adamant reiteration that BCash “is Bitcoin,” technical analysis continues to cast doubt on the fork’s true value. One area of concern is the nodes which form the BCash network. Bjellås’ work came in response to BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp noticing that over half of its nodes were Alibaba servers in China. “Compare that to 2% of reachable Bitcoin nodes running on Hangzhou Alibaba servers,” he wrote. Bjellås then produced a visual representation of the situation, which he manually computed. The #BitcoinABC (only includes "ABC" agents) distribution of public software nodes visualized in a graph. #Bitcoin #BTC #BCH #BitcoinCash pic.twitter.com/Du1vmd501g — Sondre Bjellås (@SondreB) December 21, 2017 Decentralization Wins Consensus On Reddit, Szabo’s comments gained considerable attention and support as proponents of Bitcoin lined up to agree on the essential characteristic of decentralization being required for long-term success. “I know decentralization is not as sexy a selling point as instant and cheap payments but just remember the following,” the top response reads. [T]here were many precursors to bitcoin which worked similarly – insofar that they used the internet and cryptography to function – but they were all doomed to fail for one reason: they were centralized[.] BCash suffered considerable price losses Friday, shedding up to 35% of its value in 24 hours while Bitcoin sustained lighter losses over the same period.

bitcoinist	chainwashing-r3-swanson-blockchain-hype	97% of Blockchain Startups are 'Chainwashing' - R3's Tim Swanson	2017-02-15T24:00	Chainwashing is the perfect term, coined by R3’s Tim Swanson to describe the current “Blockchain, not Bitcoin” hype that is hopefully nearing its peak. Peak Blockchain Hype? There is a lot of hype around Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) today. According to a new survey by Synechron among 200 financial services business and IT decision-makers across the US, UK and Europe, over two-thirds (67%) of companies in the industry are actively pursuing blockchain initiatives. Moreover, 94%, believe that key leaders (board members) have bought into developing blockchain projects. Today, the blockchain space resembles the hype of cloud computing a few years ago, where companies can simply throw the “Blockchain” buzzword around simply to get investor attention. What was once known as “ cloudwashing,” i.e. rebranding an old product or service by associating the buzzword “cloud,” has now become “Chainwashing,” according to Tim Swanson, Director of Market Research at R3CEV. Swanson noted in a blog post : We think the number of companies with legs will continue to increase over time but chainwashing will continue to be a noise pollution problem for the next few years in the enterprise world even after production systems have been integrated into institutions. Swanson spends much of his time filtering startups that his team at R3 speaks with every month. Pretty much every pitch nowadays leverages buzzwords like “blockchain” and “distributed ledger.” Although his team has listened to roughly 400 pitches in the past year, there are only about a dozen “companies with legs.” Reinventing The Wheel Swanson vets startups’ motives by asking how they define “blockchain,” what problems it can fix, and if these can be fixed using existing and proven technology. “By asking these types of questions our team has helped filter the 400 or so companies/projects into a much more manageable dozen,” he notes. Many of these companies try to reinvent the wheel as a square and call it wheel 2.0, only to remain relevant in the tech world, where the trend towards decentralization is gaining steam. There is, however, a reason why the majority of services are centralized: because it works. Centralized systems are usually more reliable, efficient and scalable, particularly for enterprises. Editable blockchains are a prime example. They are, for all intents and purposes, distributed databases, something that is not new at all. Blockchain technology, on the other hand, can bring immutability and transparency using consensus mechanisms such as Bitcoin’s proof-of-work. Do you want to set your records in stone? Make them semi-transparent? If not, then maybe a plain old database just might solve your problems. Otherwise, there’s a good chance many of these so-called ‘blockchain startups’ are simply chainwashing in an attempt to fool investors. “As a consequence, it is probably safe to assume vendors are trying to pull a fast one on you, especially if it involves needing your company to acquire a cryptocurrency or ‘permissioning off’ an existing cryptocurrency,” explains Swanson. According to legend, if you say Blockchain three times fast, your databases will magically become immutable & your company a fintech leader. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) August 28, 2016 Chainwashing Everything Even Central Banks are engaging in chainwashing, in fact. One example is the idea of blockchain-based virtual (fiat) currency planned by the People’s Bank of China. While the system will be built using blockchain technology, it will behave just like a centralized database with identification-linked accounts. Using blockchain technology for this purpose will not make fiat currency better, at least for the citizens. The fiat monetary system will remain centralized, debt-based, and inflationary. It will, however, remove the control and privacy that was once granted to users of physical cash. Indeed, chainwashing is increasingly becoming a common practice used to attract funding and media attention. Startups such as Arcade City, an Ethereum-based ride-sharing application, or Matchpool’s ‘blockchain-based Tinder’ come to mind. “What is it about a blockchain that solves a problem that couldn’t be solved with existing technology?” asks Swanson. Do you think the era of the blockchain will fade into irrelevance like so many others? Or the hype real and here to stay? Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Twitter

bitcoinist	charlie-shrem-technology-power	Charlie Shrem: 'It’s Not About The Technology Anymore, It's About Power' - Bitcoinist.com	2017-04-25T09:00	Bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem shared his views on the scaling debate, stating that “it’s not about technology anymore, it’s about power.” Shrem: ‘It’s About Power’ Charlie Shrem, Bitcoin entrepreneur and co-founder of Intellysis, was present in today’s episode of the Double Down show, dubbed “ Does Block Size Matter? ” with the usual hosts Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. During the show, Shrem expressed his thoughts regarding the current state of the scaling debate or as Herbert called it, “the Great Blocksize War of 2017.” Shrem stated: In reality, it’s not a technical argument anymore. Everyone on both sides of the table say that SegWit is the best technology that we have. According to Shrem, the scaling debate is no longer about the most viable technology or solution that can be used to scale Bitcoin. Instead, the scaling debate has become a power struggle between two development teams, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Core. “The other side of the debate, which is Bitcoin Unlimited, they agree that SegWit is a great technology,” he continued. “But to them it’s not about technology anymore, it’s about power.” Shrem went on to say: They want to remove [Bitcoin Core’s] ability to work on Bitcoin and instead have a closed-membership small group of four to five developers, who they think are the best for the job, run Bitcoin going forward. A Test for Bitcoin However, there is a silver lining in this development, which Shrem considers it as an “extremely bullish situation for Bitcoin.” The current block size “drama” is showcasing Bitcoin’s ability to resist a malicious attack on the network. He noted: Here you have a group of bad actors who are trying to overtake the Bitcoin network and essentially fork all of bitcoin and force all Bitcoin users to be able to use their developers and their codebase and their everything and it’s not a group of miners that’s preventing this. Shrem sees the current h ash power signaling as a “glorified poll” when it comes to hard fork given that nodes are the ones that validate blocks and they can discard the ones from the hard-forked chain at will, meaning that miners don’t have nearly as much power as they think they do. This can be observed the UASF proposal, which would bypass the miners completely and leave it up to the nodes to force SegWit into activation. However, it may not come down to a UASF, as mining pools like F2Pool are beginning to move to SegWit driven by demand from individual users that contribute hashrate to the pool. Champagne Problem Not all is gloomy for Bitcoin, however. Amidst all the tension and drama, one must also look at the bright side, which is the reason we’re having this heated debate at all: Bitcoin is growing at an exponential rate. This is, as Shrem puts it, a “champagne problem,” one that gives us as much to celebrate as it gives us to fight about. “It’s a good problem to have. Bitcoin has grown really quickly. We never expected this to happen so quickly, to be honest. We’re getting towards what they call a ‘champagne problem,’ how do you scale?” he said. This means that not only is Bitcoin working as intended, but there is also an urgent need for such a currency in the world. Now, it’s only a matter of making sure that Bitcoin can become that currency and still maintain its decentralized and immutable characteristics. Shrem concluded: There has always been research and conversations on scaling over the past three years but, to be honest, we didn’t think we’d see this exponential growth in Bitcoin and now it’s time to have that conversation. Do you agree? Is the scaling debate actually about power and control? Share below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, alchetron.com, coin.dance
bitcoinist	china-learn-love-crypto	Could China Learn to Love Crypto Again? - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-04T19:30	Even though China is one of the countries spearheading the fight against decentralized cryptocurrencies, previous BTCC CEO, Bobby Lee, is hopeful that the country will eventually become more accepting of the industry. Think ‘Bitcoin banning’, and your mind probably goes directly to China. The country has been vocal in its disdain for the cryptocurrency industry. In proving that its bite is indeed worse than its bark, it banned ICOs and closed down Bitcoin exchanges. High Hopes of China Changing Its Stance One such platform, BTCC, was the country’s longest-running Bitcoin exchange, and one of the first to find itself in the firing line. However, according to CNBC, the CEO and co-founder of the platform, Bobby Lee, believes that China will change its mind and veto its previous crypto bans. He had this to say: In this world, nothing is ever permanent. One day I think it’s possible they’ll lift the ban, so called, and they might reinstitute it and license it. Even though Lee remains positive in his outlook, he doesn’t have a date as to when this might happen: Frankly speaking, I don’t know what kind of time frame that is, whether it’s a few months, a few years or even a few decades, so it’s hard to tell. Lee also made reference to the fact that Bitcoin was not only seemingly unfazed by China’s bans, it actually made the currency perform even better: The more the governments and the regulators tried to put a squeeze on Bitcoin, the more we see that Bitcoin is actually resilient. Increase in Regulations Some countries, while not banning cryptocurrencies outright, are instead setting up regulatory frameworks. South Korea is reportedly set to prohibit anonymous user accounts used in crypto trading. Even though Lee might be hoping for a Chinese change-around, the country itself shows no evidence of this. In fact, the South China Morning Post reported that the People’s Daily, which is known as being the puppet publication of the Communist Party, had this to say: Irrespective of whether it is assessed on price or value, Bitcoin is flooded with froth. Supply and Demand to Influence Future Bitcoin Price In addition to discussing his hope that China will change its mind, Lee also touched on Bitcoin’s possible price journey for this year: Today we’re at only 1,800 of newly mined Bitcoin of every day. That used to be 7,200 as recently as five years ago. So, in just a few short, maybe two-and-a-half more years, we’ll see the supply go down again to only 900 bitcoins a day. He went on to explain: So, if you talk about multi-million dollars of inflow with only new supply of 900 bitcoins a day, you can imagine where prices could be at in three, five, or 10 years. Lee is currently not in the exchange business, focusing rather on other ventures including working on Mobi, which is a global multicurrency crypto wallet “so we have a global play for wallets and we’re no longer focused on just being an exchange business,” Lee explained. Do you think China will lift its crypto ban in the future? Let us know in the comments below! Images and media courtesy of Shutterstock, CNBC
bitcoinist	china-new-onecoin-80x-growth	Forget The Name? China's New OneCoin Posts 80x Growth	2017-12-11T06:30	While China’s Localbitcoins market sets new records, investors appear to be piling in to a brand new Ethereum-based asset – OneCoin. CEO: We Didn’t Want The Speculation As Quartz reports Monday, the unfortunately named OneCoin, which domestic tech company Xunlei released in October, since achieved an all-time high of 80 times its original price. China has sought to ban crypto-to-fiat trading this year by closing down exchanges, and has also prevented any ICOs from raising funds with Chinese investors. Consumers continue to take advantage of Bitcoin’s price bull run on ‘unofficial’ means such as Localbitcoins, yet it is OneCoin which increasingly looks to be the new ‘fad’ for shorters. The coin was originally only intended to be a form of in-house currency for Xunlei’s various services, the company having gone Blockchain in August. As one analyst notes to Quartz, however, the token has since become an undesired speculatory asset, which Xunlei itself finds worrying. “When it first came out, a coin was available for only 1 cent, but the over-the-counter price was now around $8 a piece,” its CEO told local publication Beijing News about OneCoin’s recent explosion. Not A Hint Of Ponzi A major bone of contention for Xunlei is the altcoin’s legal status should it become too widespread, given China’s current regulatory stranglehold on free trading of cryptoassets. A dispute with a partner did not help the situation, which resulted in allegations Xunlei was conducting a banned ICO in China. In response to regulatory fears, meanwhile, the company announced that every trader using its wallet must supply their real name and become verified by December 14, something which then sent prices back down again. While seemingly unimportant to Chinese traders, OneCoin also shares itself with a notorious international alleged ponzi scheme which multiple international governments have warned citizens not to invest in. That OneCoin has already seen its fair share of arrests, with Indian lawmakers notably freezing funds associated with the scheme. What do you think about China’s OneCoin?

bitcoinist	chinese-official-new-regulations-2018-may-end-ico-ban	Chinese Official: New Regulations for 2018 May End ICO Ban	2018-01-25T24:00	China’s People’s University Law School vice-president Yang Dong has let slip the country is preparing new regulation on cryptocurrency and ICOs for 2018. Sorting ‘Good’ From ‘Bad’ ICOs Speaking at the Southeast Asia Blockchain Summit, Yang, who is also director of the Center for Financial Technology, further “denied” a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading and ICOs would continue indefinitely. China has enacted a major clampdown on how citizens can legally access and trade cryptocurrency in the past six months. September saw the second exchange shutdown of 2017 become a permanent moratorium on crypto-to-fiat platforms, with lawmakers signaling earlier this month they would seek to end “centralized” exchange activities altogether. September also saw a sudden halt on ICOs, with projects which had already accrued funds but not launched tokens being obliged to return investments. Against the current backdrop of additional clampdowns on mining activity in China, Yang’s words thus appear surprising. While confirming over-the-counter and overseas exchanges “would be strictly regulated,” local news outlet 8btc reports that Yang added that the remedial regulatory climate in China was ostensibly meant to weed out “bad” ICO projects to allow bonafide offerings to flourish. Opportunities To ‘Get Compliant’ During the interview with 8btc, Yang states: Good ICO projects are allowed to develop in a legal and risk-controlled environment rather than simply adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. He goes on to add: [The China Securities Regulatory Commission] may launch equity crowdfunding pilot program in the near future, which will be an opportunity for ICO to get in compliance. While Chinese investors have made headlines in their attempts to circumvent restrictions, nearby major market South Korea is also softening its previous statements on cryptocurrency-related bans. Strict regulation of exchanges now appears to be the order of the day, while ICOs remain similarly outlawed under Seoul’s jurisdiction. New guidelines outlawing anonymous trading are due to come into force January 30, which will also see foreign citizens barred from using Korean exchanges.

bitcoinist	civil-fighting-fake-news-innovating-journalism-ethereum	Civil: Fighting Fake News and Innovating Journalism with Ethereum - Bitcoinist.com	2017-06-24T09:00	Not to be confused with Civic, fledgeling startup Civil aims to curb fake news and innovate the journalistic process with the creation of an Ethereum based decentralised platform for citizens and journalists. The Modern Problem Nowadays, many news organisations are struggling to find a sustainable or profitable business model for their operations. Technologies like AdBlock and other similar ad-blockers have forced many news organisations to block content for ad-blocker users, effectively reducing traffic and potential revenue. Civil, is trying to solve this major problem by utilising E thereum blockchain technology in order to create a sustainable business model for news organisations and journalists. In an official post, Civil explained how they are trying to accomplish that goal: We propose a solution called Civil, an Ethereum-based decentralized platform that can be used to create “newsrooms” and “stations” — blockchain-based marketplaces where citizens and journalists form communities around a shared purpose and set of standards, financially support factual reporting and investigative work, and substantially limit misinformation through effective collaborative-editing methods. The net result is a self-sustaining global marketplace for journalism that is free from ads, fake news, and outside influence. The Civil Platform The Civil platform will use a marketplace model where journalists and users can effectively share the same content and interests. Newsrooms and Stations will allow users and journalists to collaborate in communities where the same interests are shared. These communities will also allow users to financially support their favourite journalists and news organisations. Economy of the Platform The economy of the platform will be based on a token called CVL. In order for users to enjoy quality journalism, the users will have to spend CVL tokens in order to gain access to newsrooms’ and stations’ content. The token will also allow users to participate, vote and contribute to news content. Distribution of the CVL Tokens The Civil team is aiming to reach certain points before they launch the official CVL token distribution. Some of these points are: 10,000 community members across email and Slack, 100 First Fleet journalists committed to 12–24 inaugural newsrooms, Completed prototype that everyone can use. In the meantime, Civil is actively hiring new E thereum developers and product designers to help build the Civil platform. Will the Civil project reduce fake news? How will this collaborative platform affect news journalism? Let us know what you think in the comments below. Images courtesy of Civil, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	coinbase-exchanges-wont-run-lightning-antonopoulos	Coinbase, Exchanges 'Won't Run' Lightning Network - Andreas Antonopoulos	2018-01-26T04:30	Andreas Antonopoulos has said he doesn’t expect regulated exchanges such as Coinbase to run the Lightning Network as it gains mainstream acceptance. ‘Their KYC Fell Apart’ In comments on the first episode of Let’s Talk Bitcoin! in 2018, the educator said AML/KYC obligations exchanges face are incompatible with the nature of Lightning, which recently launched a limited yet rapidly-growing mainnet implementation. The upgrade to the Bitcoin network promises vastly reduced transaction times and fees, yet its tentative 230-node launch is still experimental, with various parties warning users not to use it until suitable advances have been made or face losing money. “I don’t think Coinbase will run Lightning, and I think there are many reasons why we’re not going to see regulated exchanges run Lightning Hubs,” Antonopoulos told host Adam B. Levine earlier this week. Lightning network has quickly grown to 235 nodes Chief motivator for his perspective is LN’s security setup: a transaction can make as many as 20 ‘hops’ between nodes to reach its target, yet no node in the chain even knows which position it is fulfilling. “Imagine this from Coinbase’s perspective,” Antonopoulos continued. They have a fully KYC/AML-ed customer on one end of their connection, but if they receive a payment that’s going to that customer over the Lightning Network, they have no idea whether that customer’s the final destination… If they receive one coming in from that customer, they have no idea if that customer’s the origin… Which means their KYC just fell apart – completely fell apart. Lightning ‘Enthusiasm’ Goes Into Overdrive The prospect of exchanges avoiding Lightning to stay on the right side of the law will likely deflate the hopes many existing Bitcoin users have that the technology will be Bitcoin’s ‘killer app.’ Nonetheless, both enthusiasm and appetite for its development continue to grow unabated, with a survey suggesting developers plan to dedicate “about 1321 hours per week” to its advancement. “Developer enthusiasm is real,” Tuur Demeester tweeted in comments on the findings. Developer enthusiasm for #LightningNetwork + Bitcoin is real. "Surveyed developers plan to give about 1,321 hours per week to bitcoin/lightning development." Thread: https://t.co/peVOpk4Gig — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) January 25, 2018 Running in tandem is the narrative that LN mainnet is still too dangerous for practical use, an opinion held by well-known Bitcoin community figures such as Bitcoin.org creator Cobra. Similar to development of core structures, the status quo is not stopping third parties coming out with brave yet perhaps premature offerings such as Strike, billed as the LN version of Stripe. Antonopoulos meanwhile further noted that Blockstream’s ostensibly user-focused LN implementation this month in the form of its webstore is in fact unable to be used for purchases with Lightning payments. The store is more for developers than users, he explained. What do you think about Andreas Antonopoulos’ perspective on the Lightning Network? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	coinbase-insider-trading-bcash-launch	Coinbase Accused of Insider Trading After Botched BCash Launch	2017-12-20T07:30	Traders are accusing Coinbase and its GDAX trading platform of “insider trading” after Bitcoin Cash (BCH) appeared to reach $9000 in a failed launch. Industry Cries Foul Over Coinbase/ GDAX BCash ‘Trading’ Significant price volatility in BCH, also known as BCash, accompanied a botched release on GDAX, which then saw activity tantamount to market manipulation, critics are saying. Trading of the altcoin stopped completely in the hours after launch, due to recommence December 20 at 09:00 pacific time. BCash is currently mired in an increasingly wide scandal involving unlikely alleged “colluders” including news network CNBC. The altcoin’s huge price uptick across major exchanges to in excess of $3400 came as a CNBC Twitter account suddenly began posting BCash advertising, publicly calling out any responses critical of its tone. Coinbase, which is part of the product index for CME Group after it launched Bitcoin futures trading Sunday, is facing pressure. “…By being part of a product index for (CMEGroup) you agreed to certain rules,” one popular commentary on the situation reads. “Since bch news was clearly leaked around 2:30pm CST to certain parties. this qualifies as insider trading. Hope you enjoy the incoming complaints.” hey @coinbase, @GDAX and @brian_armstrong by being part of a product index for @CMEGroup you agreed to certain rules. Since bch news was clearly leaked around 2:30pm CST to certain parties. this qualifies as insider trading. Hope you enjoy the incoming complaints. — I am Nomad (@IamNomad) December 20, 2017 Armstrong: We’ll Conduct ‘Investigation’ The exchange is allegedly “investigating” the insider trading claims, Quartz reports, while posting official announcements defending its practices. “Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter,” CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a dedicated blog post. If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies — directly or indirectly — I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action. Other sources have been more vocal in their suspicion, meanwhile. Coinbase’s recent roadmap has become a further focus, its “projected” plans to implement partial BCash support contrasting strongly with this week’s reality. This was #Coinbase Roadmap published 4 days ago. this was totally a misleading practice. No announcement, fake roadmap. You just lost a shit ton of trust. Time to change exchanger. pic.twitter.com/6GapqvYJr1 — Andrea Disperati (@Andrea_Dispe) December 20, 2017 BitFury CEO George Kikvadze accused organizers of a “pump and dump” scheme. “The only thing the Pumpers forgot all of this is happening on… US (soil) on a USA Exchange with Billions of People’s Assets,” he added.

bitcoinist	coincheck-reimburse-425-million-users-affected-hack	Coincheck to Reimburse $425 Million to Users After Hack - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-28T05:15	Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck announced that it would reimburse roughly $425 million to its users affected by the recent hack. Usually when a cryptocurrency exchange is hacked, its users are out of luck. Valuable coins that have been stolen are never seen again, leaving users with empty wallets, shattered hopes, and lots of anger. However, the recent major hack of Coincheck is playing out differently as the Japanese exchange announces it will pay back $425 million to those affected by the virtual robbery. Staggering Losses The recent hack on Coincheck was huge. Overall, 58 billion yen worth (just over $533 million USD) of NEM coins were stolen, which forced the crypto exchange to shut down all withdrawals except for bitcoins. However, there is light at the end of the dark, dark tunnel. The exchange now says that it will pay back 46.3 billion yen ($425 million) to the 260,000 users who were impacted by the hack. Some may say that the repayment is only about 90% of the actual funds stolen, but I would argue that getting 90% of your stolen money back is a damn good thing. Reparations policy towards users affected by the illicit transfer of the cryptocurrency NEM from Coincheck https://t.co/uaYAwj4QcM — Coincheck (@coincheck_en) January 28, 2018 Not Being Hung Out to Dry On the official Coincheck blog, the exchange notes: We realize that this illicit transfer of funds from our platform and the resulting suspension in services has caused immense distress to our customers, other exchanges, and people throughout the cryptocurrency industry, and we would like to offer our deepest and humblest apologies to all of those involved. In moving towards reopening our services, we are putting all of our efforts towards discovering the cause of the illicit transfer and overhauling and strengthening our security measures while simultaneously continuing in our efforts to register with the Financial Services Agency as a Virtual Currency Exchange Service Provider. Reparations will be made in JPY coins that will be paid into a Coincheck wallet. The actual method for applying the reimbursement, as well as the time it will take place, has not yet been determined. The calculation method for the coin amount is based upon the weighted average price of NEM, which constitutes the prices from the suspension of new purchases to the time of the reparation announcement. Another sting is likely waiting for the crypto exchange. The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) is also considering some sort of administrative punishment, such as a fine, for the hack. Exchanges operating in Japan are supposed to have adequate security to prevent such attacks. What do you think about Coincheck reimbursing its users? Were you one of the 260,000 affected by the hack?

bitcoinist	coincheck-rumors-600m-hack	Major Japanese Exchange Freezes Withdrawals After $600M 'Hack'	2018-01-26T09:30	Major Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has just confirmed that more than $600 million worth of XEM were stolen in a hack earlier today. Coincheck Confirms Hack After social media announcements alerted users to a shutdown which first affected NEM’s XEM token and then all currencies, rumors soon followed that Coincheck had lost control of funds. Bitcoin prices began trending downwards Friday. A short while ago, those rumors were confirmed as the exchange announced that it had, indeed, been hacked. While the exchange has yet to release an official statement on either its website or via social media, Twitter user @iamjosephyoung tweeted several confirmed updates: Official: 58 billion Japanese yen or $530 million worth of NEM was stolen from CoinCheck. Credit to @ETHxCC for reporting first. According to MineCC, CoinCheck used hot wallets not cold wallets, which are not secure. Press conference by CoinCheck. https://t.co/h3IdFJ6ZcD — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) January 26, 2018 NEM.io Foundation President Lon Wong also confirmed the hack, saying that 526 million XEM worth approximately $420 million as of this writing, had been stolen. In addition to the XEM theft, a second unauthorized transaction of more than 101.2 million XRP ($123.5 million) also reportedly took place, although it has not yet been confirmed whether that transaction was related to the XEM hack. A massive XRP moved from Coincheck to somewhere!!! Does this relate their today's NEM trade freeze? #coincheck $xrp $nem https://t.co/9xxiIzfeSz — ⚡11outrage⚡ (@11outrage) January 26, 2018 Coincheck’s own warnings its books were on partial lockdown surfaced earlier Friday. XEM deposits were frozen, followed by XEM withdrawals and trading. A blanket withdrawal ban then came into force, the exchange updating an “urgent” blog post with sporadic information. “All withdrawals from the platform are currently restricted, including JPY. Thank you for your understanding. We are doing our utmost to resume normal operations as soon as possible,” one of two most recent updates reads. As of press time, the blog post includes advice that “Purchases and sales of cryptocurrencies other than BTC (altcoins) are currently restricted.” Exchange Security Crackdown If the amounts being floated around are accurate, the Coincheck hack could well end up being the second largest theft of cryptocurrencies to date, dwarfing the amount claimed by attackers in any of 2017’s wallet compromises, including Parity’s much-publicized losses. Record-breaking or not, it certainly marks a major blow to Japan’s fledgling regulated exchange sector. The news comes at a time when security robustness of Asian exchanges remains under the spotlight. In South Korea, regulators moved to fine exchanges for lax safety measures after an investigation revealed six out of ten major platforms were flouting laws. At around $25,000 per offending exchange, criticism of laws continues to revolve around the fact that such violations deserve higher penalties due to the amounts of money at stake. UPDATE: Shortly after the original article went to press, new information began emerging. The article has been updated to reflect currently available information.

bitcoinist	coincheck-shows-relief-regulator-orders-improvements-hack	Coincheck Shows Relief As Regulator Orders 'Improvements' After Hack	2018-01-29T07:00	Japan’s financial regulator has ordered hacked exchange Coincheck to “improve” but appears uninterested in restricting cryptocurrency activities. FSA: ‘Don’t Do It Again!’ In an order to Coincheck, which lost $530 million to hackers last week, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan has demanded a full explanation of what went wrong, along with a raft of upgrades for “prevention of similar events in the future.” Following news that malicious parties had compromised the exchange’s hot wallet, its questionable security practices soon came into the spotlight, with commentators suggesting its setup was insufficient to guard against online threats. The hack is one of the largest in history, falling nonetheless around $320 million behind the infamous Mt. Gox exchange heist in 2013. In a new blog post Monday, Coincheck sounded palpably relieved: We earnestly accept the terms of the order and vow to re-examine our business practices while simultaneously striving to make all facts involved in this case clear, discover the root cause of the breach, safeguard our customers, and develop stronger and more effective measures for system risk management and prevention of similar events in the future. Users Await 90% Token Refund The FSA’s move comes a week after South Korean authorities opted to fine six major cryptocurrency exchanges over poor security after an investigation and white hat hack demonstrated similar lapses. Coincheck must submit a report about the incident by February 13th, but no deadline has yet appeared for it to make good on its promise to reimburse 90% of customer funds. NEM’s XEM token, the main victim of the hack, has since broadly recovered as markets begin moving on from the shock. For Japan’s consumers, however, the impact of the hack could linger. Genki Oda, president of fellow exchange BitPoint Japan, told Reuters: I have to admit that all cryptocurrencies will now be tainted in their minds, so there may be a mid-term negative impact.

bitcoinist	core-dev-greg-maxwell-exits-blockstream	Greg Maxwell Exits Blockstream As Lightning Network Sparks Warnings	2018-01-19T22:30	Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Greg Maxwell announced he has left the company as criticism mounts over its Lightning Network advocacy. Maxwell: Blockstream Has Been ‘Big Success’ In a circular to the core mailing list Friday, Maxwell said he had opted to “spend more time working independently” on Bitcoin technical advances. “We hoped that Blockstream could help act as an anchor of support for technology development, and in doing so help grow the community. I think that has been a big success,” he wrote. From what I’ve been told Blockstream plans to continue to contribute to awesome technology in Bitcoin – as demonstrated by their Lightning [Network] webstore this week – but if they didn’t, that wouldn’t be a problem for Bitcoin. Maxwell added that he had in fact left Blockstream at the end of November, but had continued finishing his involvement until the new year. Blockstream Criticized Over Mainnet Lightning Network Debut As Maxwell unveiled proof-of-concept work for Bitcoin scaling upgrade Schnorr multisignatures this week together with other Core developers, Blockstream’s latest technical release has received mixed reactions. After it launched the pioneering store Maxwell mentions, which is one of the first outlets to accept Lightning payments, Bitcoin community figures criticized the move as premature given the technology’s experimental status. “The way (Blockstream) is promoting LN use on mainnet is very irresponsible. People will lose money and LN reputation will be damaged,” Bitcoin.org creator Cobra wrote on Twitter, sparking a debate involving Civic CEO Vinny Lingham and commentator Vortex. A growing number of people care or are at least curious pic.twitter.com/BMAeQBDwGJ — Lee (@leehughes21) January 19, 2018 Blockstream had in fact noted in a post about the release that Lightning was in a “testing stage,” inviting early users to report any inconsistencies. As Bitcoinist reported Thursday, the network currently boasts a modest but quickly growing presence on the Bitcoin mainnet, at press time comprising approximately 50 nodes and 80 channels with a total capacity of just under $12,000. The statistics resource tracking the data also carries a more cryptic haiku-style warning not to place too much trust in the nascent network.

bitcoinist	cpchain-bringing-blockchain-to-the-internet-of-things	CPChain Bringing Blockchain to the Internet of Things - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T17:30	The Internet of Things is an exciting and quickly growing field of technology, and blockchain technology could make the platform quicker and more inexpensive. Cyber-Physical chain is looking to change the way IoT works. Streamlining the Future The Cyber Physical Chain (CPChain) will enable the ever-expanding Internet of Things (IoT) industry to grow into a more universal network for devices all around the world. The primary goal of the project is to reduce the costs of system connectivity, ensure user privacy, and provide a stable, secure system for the IoT. Blockchain technology can offer a lot to a project looking to disrupt major industries due to its decentralized and verifiable nature. Things like scalability, security, and real-time problem monitoring can be solved by implementing a blockchain in the right way. CPChain has recognized this potential market for a blockchain based IoT, and by combining distributed ledger technology along with encrypted storage and computing, a next generational IoT architecture can be built offering a complete platform for data acquisition, storage, and application of IoT industry to the public. A Quickly Growing Industry The IoT is still in its infancy and building an application such as this could send ripples through the technology community. It is estimated that around 3 billion devices will connect to the IoT in the next three years, and that number is set to grow exponentially. While very exciting, the concept is not without its problems. The biggest issue is the cost. The fact that the system is centralized by a few parties can drive up costs. Interoperability (the ability for software to communicate with each other) between different clients or architecture raises its own set of problems, most notably isolability. This would result in “data islands,” with a few devices only connected with each other without connecting to the network at large. Privacy and security are two huge aspects that need to be a primary concern as well. And due to the anonymous and unidentifiable characteristics of a distributed ledger, these concerns can be easily addressed. The Faces Behind the Idea The team behind the project has a long history in finance and technology. The co-founder and principal scientist, Dr. Long Chengnian, boasts a doctorate in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong, one of the most prestigious universities in China. Dr. Chengnian was recently interviewed about the project, having this to say about the goals of the platform: The goal of this chain of information is to create a common IoT data openness and sharing platform that enables real-time data movement and is therefore used for many types of scenarios such as data storage, sharing and big data applications. Investors are Flocking to CPChain We’ve already seen a few big projects throw their weight behind the team. Big name projects such as QTUM and VeChain are supporting the project, and integration with other blockchain based projects could bring all of them to a new level. VeChain, specifically, is looking to bring the transparency of blockchain technology to the fast-paced world of business commerce. Their goal is to facilitate verifiable information flow, efficient collaboration between businesses, and extremely fast value transfer. QTUM looks to make distributed ledger technology easy and quick to deploy for business entities. The platform will enable smart contract execution and allow developers to build decentralized applications on top of the main chain. There are also large backers in traditional funding and investment firms. Torque.VC, Chainfunder, and High Performance Blockchain have all thrown their hats into the ring as well. This is following the trend of “old money” looking to get on the crypto-train, as exciting projects such as CPChain warrant proper funding to fully bring their ideas to market. Powering CPChain with the CPC Token The system runs its own native token called CPC, which on its most basic level is meant to measure the level of economic activity of the platform. The token will be used as a sort of “gas” for transactions, which will fuel all transactions on the network whether it be data or an economic unit. The token max limit has been set at one billion, the majority of which were sold privately to institutional investors. The team has kept a percentage of the total tokens for themselves but have locked them in a cryptographically secured crypto-vault for three years. This is meant to demonstrate a commitment to the project and incentivize the developers to produce a well working platform and valuable platform. For more information about CPChain, please visit cpchain.io and download the project’s lightpaper and whitepaper. Is CPChain the future of blockchain on the Internet of Things? How will it help facilitate mainstream blockchain adoption? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of CPChain, VeChain, QTUM, Torque VC, Chainfunder, HPB, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	craigslist-cryptocurrency-ok-button	Craigslist Goes Crypto With 'Cryptocurrency OK' Button	2017-12-08T07:00	Private advertisement listings site Craigslist now allows users to specify they are “OK” with cryptocurrency payments. A ‘Huge’ Step For Exposure Screenshots appearing on social media Thursday confirmed the move, which marks the first formal interaction between the resource and the technology. Craigslist, which ranks top in the world for classified ads according to SimilarWeb and has an Alexa rating of 106, is a “huge” step in support for crypto, community members said in response to the move. “The number of people who use Craigslist is huge, and I’m guessing there is no particular correlation between using Craigslist and already being involved with Bitcoin,” a top Reddit response reads. That means another bunch of people unfamiliar with it are going to be seeing it presented to them as an option. Bitcoin’s mainstream ‘push’ has accelerated in recent months, seeing Wall Street involvement combine with increased public awareness. This is slated in turn to produce more consumer options for its use, Craigslist nonetheless being the first major trendsetter in the classified space. One Checkbox Takes Craigslist Into Crypto The cryptocurrency ‘support’ is in fact somewhat spartan. When posting an ad, users now have the option of ticking a checkbox labeled “cryptocurrency OK” to show buyers they may pay, assumedly in any cryptocurrency, for the product or service on offer. Countering concerns about safety, another Reddit response explained how payment could occur in practice. “From the seller’s perspective, they can have a watch-only wallet & see the TX confirm. From the buyer’s perspective, if they’re paying with a private key-holding mobile wallet, they have to worry about the stranger seller robbing them of their mobile while it’s unlocked,” they explained. If the seller agrees to lock the BTC price, the buyer can just come with a signed TX from their non-mobile wallet & use a pushtx service in front of the seller, no mobile wallet required. A seller with good reputation/ratings they can link to their phone (number) can also request that the payment be made in advance of the buyer’s arrival, so that it has time to confirm.

The result is Dai, the first fully-decentralized stablecoin on Ethereum. MakerDAO was formed three years ago with a big vision of creating a stable, decentralized digital global economy. It has worked its way out of the grassroots to finally launch Dai, a promising cryptocurrency that promises stability in currency valuation. Understanding Dai’s Valuation Dai is currently worth 1 USD. It is designed to have low volatility against the world’s leading national currencies, such as the Euro and USD. MakerDAO has two mechanisms to ensure that this happens. For starters, Dai has an autonomous system of smart contracts that monitors the market’s dynamics and responds accordingly. This system is designed to be independent so that no one can alter its mechanism. As such, even MakerDAO cannot alter the system, hence ensuring that no one can manipulate Dai’s value for self-gain while inconveniencing other Dai users. Secondly, Dai is backed a secured asset that is held in the Maker smart contract. Initially, this collateral will be pooled Ether that users will hand over to generate Dai. Users can retrieve their collateral by paying off the debt of the Dai that they initially received as well as a minor stability fee. Getting Dai Unlike Bitcoin, which you have to mine or purchase, you can get Dai coins by either making them or buying them. To create Dai, you have to log onto the MakerDAO platform and send Ether to the Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). Making Dai is quite easy, and you can learn more about it here. You can also always buy Dai coins if you are not in a position to create one. You can always find Dai sellers here. Take Advantage of Dai Dai promises to be a stable currency for all uses, especially now that global currencies can be so volatile. It is ideal for people seeking to secure their finances as well as those seeking to take advantage of the booming popularity of digital currencies. Many people are excited of the potential of Dai. Joey Krug, the co-founder of Augur, said: When people ask me what the biggest remaining challenges in the space are I tell them scalability and stablecoins. I’m really excited about Maker and Dai as I think stablecoins are key to any sort of financial contracts on Ethereum. Even if you’re right, but still have the volatility of Ether, you can’t speculate on many long term speculative events. I’m excited to be able to use Dai within Augur’s markets! Dai is still in its early stages, and its stability is expected to attract many users in the near future. The MakerDAO team is still working to improve the currency, and you can keep track of the development here. You can also get in touch with the brains behind Dai here. Do you think that Dai will live up to its expectations? Would you invest in Dai? Share your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of Dai Foundation and Pixabay.
bitcoinist	cryptcoin-anonymity-and-its-latest-surge	CryptCoin: Anonymity and it's latest surge - Bitcoinist.com	2014-06-18T07:19	Firstly, CryptCoin is a hybrid proof of work and proof of security coin based on the X11 algorithm which uses different hash functions for mining. We all know hype is crucial in the success of a coin, but what is the result of hype and innovation? The current answer is simple, CryptCoin. Many can say that CryptCoin’s latest success is due to its Mintpal addition which could be the case, but the fact of the matter is that there is a hard working developer team behind the coin, and they have shown the ability to reach heights not achieved by other coins. The reason why CryptCoin has seen this rise is the combination of multiple things, and one of the most important is the P2P Anonymity instated by CryptCoin which is currently labeled as CryptCast. It is supposed to bring anonymous transactions through public and private key broadcasting. More information regarding CryptCast can be found in their whitepaper. Another feature in the CryptCoin wallet that I like is CryptCoin Commander which is a webGUI addition to the cryptcoind wallet that exists to enhance usability of the traditional QT, combing CryptCoin network stats and wallet functionality into one package. Some of the features included will be: Recent transactions list Ability to send CryptCoin New address generation Address management (renaming labels, archiving address) -Marketcap, Price, and Volume stats -Cryptcoin Ticker data from all listed exchanges. – Future update to include API trade functionality. – Advanced Pool Monitoring *Those in bold are ones that will be released later on Personally, I like what CryptCoin is trying to achieve. Many coins are pushing forward to try and release anonymous features for their coins, but many of them are not truly anonymous. Most notably, and one I don’t personally like that much is coin mixers as they are not truly anonymous. CryptCast seems to be a very effective way to send anonymous transactions, and more so when taking in a count the fact that it is a P2P anonymity feature. The latest addition to Mintpal bodes well for CryptCoin as it was the step needed in order to grow the coin into a larger community of users and investors. The future is bright for CryptCoin, but whether its value justifies the current state of the coin is for everyone else to decide. As always, I recommend you do your own research to make crucial decisions on investments. CryptCoin has already risen a lot compared to a couple days ago so a correction might be in order, but this was said yesterday as well. Afterwards, it doubled in price in a day’s time. CryptCoin is a promising project and everyone should definitely keep an eye on it going forward.
bitcoinist	crypterium-tops-ico-hit-parade-fourth-quarter	Crypterium Tops the ICO Hit Parade in Fourth Quarter - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-30T20:00	It looks like Crypterium will be the most popular ICO to have started in the last quarter of 2017. The tokens of the nascent cryptobank, which went on sale on October 31, were an immediate smash hit with buyers, hitting the company’s soft cap in a mere five hours. Even more interesting was the widespread distribution of the sales – buyers flocked in from 143 countries all over the world. The largest purchases came from the United States and Russia, but countries such as the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Turkey, Japan and the UK were also notably represented. In contrast to some other offerings, where a few major institutional investors buy up the bulk of tokens, by November 19 there were more than 17,000 registered token holders. Even after the substantial initial boom, buyers continued to show interest in the company’s project. A bit more than a month after the first results were announced, records showed that by December 24 the number of token holders had swollen to more than 50,000. Obviously, these cannot all be major institutional backers – the average purchase of tokens has been just north of $500. Crypterium co-founder and CEO Vladimir Gorbunov is understandably delighted by the results: I believe that of all the ICOs in the past few months, we are number one in terms of the number of token holders. We seem to appeal not just to people looking to acquire major holdings, but also to people just looking to actually use our currency. This broad-based support shows there is after all a mass market of people who are ready to use cryptocurrency and blockchain in their everyday life. Part of Crypterium’s appeal may lie in the potential breadth of application of its cryptocurrency. As a future cryptobank, it is seeking to make its decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem a part of daily life. To do so, it is creating a way to allow cryptocurrencies to be used to make instant payments for everyday purchases – paying bills, purchasing transit tickets, eating out – in short, every way one might use cash or a credit card. The project, which is based on an open-source platform, will also feature an innovative system to allow businesses to acquire cryptocurrencies (including an option for sellers to receive fiat currencies when purchases are made in cryptocurrency). The project’s third area of focus is to turn crypto loans into a more accessible product. The fact that the cryptobank platform is open to outside developers is a major advantage. Crypterium’s ICO continues through mid-January, so the final tally for the ICO is not yet known. For now, though, they must bask in the acquisition of a new following and the acclaim that comes with being the newest and brightest star in the cryptocurrency firmament. For more information about Crypterium please visit crypterium.io and download the project whitepaper. What are your thoughts on Crypterium? How will cryptobanks help boost the adoption of cryptocurrencies by consumers? By businesses? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Crypterium
bitcoinist	crypto-caper-austrian-man-117k-bitcoin-stolen-public-wifi-network	Crypto Caper! Austrian Man has $117K in Bitcoin Stolen Over Public WIFI Network - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-25T13:45	$117,000 worth of Bitcoin was reportedly stolen from an Austrian man’s laptop in Vienna after he logged onto a public WIFI network at the restaurant he was eating in. The as yet unnamed victim, as r eported by CBS News, told authorities that his Bitcoin was transferred from his wallet after he logged onto a public WIFI network at a restaurant in Innsbruck, Austria. Police have so far been unable to confirm whether the victim’s computer had been hacked when he logged into the public network or if he had possibly been hacked prior to his claim. The coins themselves, worth over $117,000 at Bitcoin’s current price, were moved to an “unknown, untraceable account”. Responsible Ownership News of the theft highlights the responsibilities that those who invest in cryptocurrencies face in order to retain full control of their coins. Managing your own internet security comes hand in hand with owning Bitcoin. Using a strong password and encrypting your wallet can go a long way toward protecting your coins from malicious attacks. Furthermore, when using public wifi, you really should only be connecting if you run a VPN style service. Not running a VPN can expose your computer to the entire network it is on, giving attackers the potential to be able to see your activity and access your files. If you keep your coins at exchanges or online wallets, something not generally recommended, make sure the site has – and that you enable – two-factor authentication for your account. Hardware wallets are another option which many seem to choose. Looking Forward As Bitcoin matures, it is believed that there will be an increasing number of companies whose primary purpose is looking after other peoples Bitcoins. This level of trust has yet to be earned in the crypto world, however, especially in light of so many thefts and exchange hacks, such as Mt. Gox and the spate of incidents reported in South Korea. Exchanges have also existed in regulatory grey areas, with many well known and busy sites such as the Cryptsy exchange and BTC-e just disappearing overnight. Perhaps one day we will see insurance options for those holding Bitcoin? Are you happy with your level of security for your bitcoins? Do you have any tips? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	crypto-charity-event-covenant-house-toronto-raises-70000	Crypto Charity Event for Covenant House Toronto Raises $70,000 - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-27T16:30	A cryptocurrency charity event organized for Covenant House Toronto raised three times their goal, netting $70,000 in Ethereum. It’s always amazing what can happen when people have control over their economic decisions. No red tape, no dealing with bank regulations, or dealing with bureaucratic nonsense. People tend to be able to accomplish far more on their own when left unfettered, and this is definitely seen when it comes to charity. Case in point is the recent crypto charity event for Covenant House Toronto that far exceeded expectations. Over $61,000 raised at #merrymerkle so far! Thanks to Robbie & Andreas for making tonight possible pic.twitter.com/NDdan6HkIX — Covenant House TO (@CovenantHouseTO) December 22, 2017 Gather Around the Merkle Tree The event in question is the Merry Merkle Tree event that was held on December 21st. More than 200 people attended the event, which was organized by Robbie Bent, the CEO of Truebit. Instead of a traditional Christmas tree, the event featured a Merkle tree that was connected to the blockchain. The goal was to raise $25,000 for Covenant House Toronto, a charity that feeds and shelters homeless youth. Of the idea for the tree and event, Bent says : We thought it was a funny pun. What if we had a Christmas Tree that lit up based on events happening on the ethereum blockchain? It’s the first hardware Christmas tree that was connected to the blockchain. Word quickly spread beyond those at the event itself, and donations came pouring in, mostly in Ether. Overall, $3,000 was raised in cash, with the remainder of the initial $70,000 in Ethereum. Donations came from companies and individuals from all across the world. Tis the Season for Giving For the event itself, a total of 86 Ether was raised. The charity hopes to raise an eventual total of $200,000, which would be enough to feed everyone at their shelter for an entire year. To date, the charity drive has raised 100.5 Ether. The charity drive is ongoing, and you can donate here. The cryptocurrency will be converted into fiat in early January. Needless to say, Bent is very happy with the amount of money raised and the response by the crypto community. He says: There’s a real community here. You have 3,000 people who are super obsessed with this new technology and the way it’s going to change the world, and I think those are the type of people who are really willing to give back. The surge in cryptocurrency prices is allowing a number of people to give heavily to charity. A couple who bought bitcoins back in 2013 are now donating all of their profits to the MUSC Hollings Cancer Center in South Carolina. The big daddy of crypto charity this year is Pine, the man behind the Pineapple Fund. He mined bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was still new, and the results have paid off. He realized that he had more money than he would ever need, so he created the fund to give away a whopping $86 million in Bitcoin to worthy charities. In the end, good things happen when people are unencumbered by regulations from governments and financial institutions. The Merry Merkle Tree event is just the latest example of people using cryptocurrency for something incredibly worthwhile. A lot of youths are going to have a safe place to sleep and something to eat due to the generosity of crypto enthusiasts. How much do you think the Merry Merkle Tree event will eventually raise? Have you ever used cryptocurrency for charitable reasons? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Twitter/@CovenantHouseTO, YouTube/Truebit, and Pixabay.
bitcoinist	crypto-movers-shakers-2017	Crypto Movers and Shakers of 2017 - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-30T05:00	This year has been nothing but monumental for cryptocurrencies and the blockchain industry. Maybe we will look back on it in years to come and see 2017 as the genesis of a new way of blending business and technology. 2017 could be seen for crypto as 1995 was for the internet, when things really started to take off. Bitcoin has been around since 2009, although, for many years, it has been seen as largely a geeky thing to mine and invest in. The king of crypto has only hit the mainstream in the last few months, but it has cemented its place there. Bitcoin and its various forks aside, this piece will focus on the altcoins which most of us hadn’t even heard of at the beginning of the year. There has been a digital explosion in ICOs in the past six months, with blockchain companies mushrooming out of nowhere and conjuring up solutions to real world issues. Some coins are just that, virtual currencies, but some try to break the Bitcoin mold of digital money and offer innovative new technology for data management and distributed ledger applications. Ether Rising Ethereum has to be right up there with game-changing cryptos for the past year. The decentralized application platform has jumped from relative obscurity in January, trading at $10, to a whopping $700 today. The 7000% increase in Ether this year has secured it the second highest crypto currency by market capitalization with $70 billion for most of the year. Big things could be in store for ETH in 2018 when the platform is upgraded, scaling issues are solved, and more applications start using it. Another coin that has made big moves in 2017 is Ripple. Many traders are skeptical about this one due to its close ties with traditional financial institutions and banks. However, these connections have just propelled the altcoin to second spot in the market capitalization charts. XRP was pretty much unknown at the beginning of the year, trading at $0.006, but it has since skyrocketed to over $2.50, where it currently trades due to a number of deals with major banks and credit card companies. The XRP blockchain will be used as a faster, more secure, and efficient way of inter-bank transfers. If it becomes the standard for such transfers, that price is sure to continue upwards. Litecoin Lifted Another one of 2017’s champions is Litecoin, which is often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold. LTC has made epic moves on the tail of its big brother, trading around $4 in January to over $240 today. Compare this 6000% rise to Bitcoin’s 1500% and it is clear that the altcoins have made bigger moves. With an improved blockchain affording faster and cheaper transactions, Litecoin is destined for greater acceptance in 2018, which will no doubt send that price higher than the record $375 it reached earlier this month. Dash has also had a very good year, starting out at around ten bucks in January, and motoring to dizzying heights of $1,500 in mid-December before pulling back to around a thousand. The popularity of Dash arises from its security and privacy, and anonymous coins will be in increasing demand throughout 2018. Dash could go higher in the new year, as could similar cryptos, such as Monero, Zcash, Zcoin, and Verge, who are all heavily weighted towards privacy. There are too many altcoins to list in total, and nearly all of them have increased in value exponentially since the beginning of 2017. Some are destined for greater things in the coming year. Keep an eye on Iota, Cardano, Neo, Nem, Stella, Qtum, Lisk, and OmiseGO. Invest wisely and always do your own research. [Full disclosure: The author of this article is a holder of multiple altcoins.] Will you be increasing your altcoin portfolio in 2018? Let us know your favorites in the comments below.

bitcoinist	crypto-regulation-not-mean-prohibition	Why Crypto Regulation Should Not Mean Prohibition - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-15T04:30	Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and banks and governments are concerned. With the momentum that the budding markets have built in recent months, digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple have become household names. However, crypto regulation does not necessarily have to mean prevention if it can be approached in the right way. In recent weeks, news has emerged of steps concerning crypto regulation taking place across the world, most significantly in Asia where the lion’s share of crypto trading occurs. Fake news and fearmongering of a complete crackdown in South Korea washed across the internet last week, causing a mass selloff and slumping markets. Exchange Regulation This should be the first step towards legitimizing the entire industry since most of us need to use them to buy and sell crypto. A report by Wired magazine suggests that UK-based crypto exchanges are being turned away by British banks who want to prevent people wiring money to them. To use Coinbase in that particular country, you would need to do so via their bank in Estonia. Banks and governments fear money laundering and tax evasion, so the only way to prevent this would be to regulate and encourage crypto exchanges, not push them away. Taxation is another key issue since crypto tokens need to be traded in and out of fiat. When there is the chance for a profit, governments are going to want their slice of the action. In the US, crypto-to-crypto trades are now taxable, according to a new law to be passed this year. The land of the free is the first to hound its citizens over taxes, whether they are operating within the country or not. A little tax collected could be a way to prevent all-out prohibition of crypto trading, which would be the greater of the two evils. ICO Framework Currently, ICOs are the Wild West, totally unregulated and open to abuse, scams, fraud, and outright theft. Most are genuine efforts to innovate by using the blockchain or making an improvement upon it. However, it is a challenge for the investor to sort the digital wheat from the chaff. A clear set of rules, regulations, and more transparency from ICOs would help to legitimize this part of the industry and bring some clarity to a clouded and crowded environment. Exchange-managed ICOs could be one step forward since, in their efforts to reduce illegitimate and illegal activities, they would only be listing the officially recognized players in the world of ICOs. Open consultation on ICOs and cryptocurrencies should also be encouraged, using a working group of blockchain experts and economists. These are just some of the things that governments and banks should be looking towards implementing instead of using the iron fist to stifle innovation and control the technology and their citizens. Is more crypto regulation required or should crypto space remain the Wild West? Add your comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	crypto-shekel-may-be-in-the-cards-for-israeli-lawmakers	'Crypto-Shekel' May Be in the Cards for Israeli Lawmakers - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-24T21:45	Three government officials in Israel’s Ministry of Finance have confirmed they are considering issuing a state-sponsored cryptocurrency, the Shekel, to reduce the number of cash transactions within the middle eastern country. The Push for a Regulated Digital Currency The Bank of Israel is looking into the possibility of a state-sponsored digital currency, according to a few government officials that agreed to comment with the requirement of anonymity. The aim with this initiative is to reduce the country’s cash transactions, which are often viewed as being used for increased tax evasion and money laundering. The Ministry of Finance is looking to include a clause in a piece of legislation due for approval in January that would help create the legal framework for a Israeli cryptocurrency. The clause will detail the proposal and give the Ministry the ability to start testing how this new currency would work and be distributed. State-Sponsored Crypto Is All the Rage Israel joins the growing list of countries that are adopting crypto and other blockchain technologies. Earlier this year, Bitcoin was declared legal tender in Japan, allowing businesses to accept the controversial currency just as it would accept fiat currencies. Japanese and South Korean banks are also testing how cryptocurrencies can be implemented to streamline cross-border payments between the two countries. Japan is also set to launch their own currency in the coming year. With the support of many financial and regulatory bodies, they plan to launch their currency with the proposed name “J-coin” before the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo. Sweden is also following the crypto-path, looking to launch an e-kronor in the future. They cite the fact that there is decreased cash usage in the Norwegian nation and that the country’s banks and businesses prefer non-cash payments. In fact, 900 of Sweden’s 1,600 banks no longer hold cash reserves or accept cash deposits. Blockchain technology, which is essentially a public account that anyone can access to verify transactions, has huge implications for anyone trying stop financial fraud. It makes sense for governments to embrace the new technology, but we’ll have to wait and see how it will work at that level. What do you think about state-sponsored cryptocurrencies? Do you think they’ll have a place in the market? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay.
bitcoinist	crypto-solutions-tackle-web-censorship-concerns	Crypto Solutions Tackle Web Censorship Concerns - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-15T01:30	As governments across the world continue to make moves to censor and control the flow of digital data across the internet, there a rising tide of concern over net neutrality. Blockchain solutions could be the answer for those seeking more freedom on the internet. A report in Thursday’s New York Times stated that the Federal Communications Commission has voted to dismantle rules regulating the companies that connect users to the internet. This would effectively yield US broadband businesses more power to control online access and information. Net Neutralized The agency has scrapped the net neutrality regulations that previously prevented internet service providers blocking content or charging their customers for premium access and services. Previously setup by the Obama administration to ensure fair and equal access to web content, the FCC voted in net neutrality by classifying internet providers as Title II common carriers. The Trump administration has now removed this classification, unraveling the regulations that gave net neutrality legitimacy. It is a step backwards for internet freedom in the US, says Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat member of the FCC. She said that the vote puts the commission: … on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of the American public. She added that the revoke gives service providers: … a green light to discriminate and manipulate your internet traffic. According to the NYT, a number of Democrats on Capitol Hill called for a bill that would reestablish the regulations, and several Democratic state attorneys general said they would file suits to stop the change. However, proponents of the change state that consumer protection will be enhanced as the Federal Trade Commission will now regain their jurisdiction over broadband providers, an authority that was stripped away due to the Obama-era legislation. Even the first FTC chairman under Obama said that restoring authority to the FTC is a good thing and that the internet will continue to thrive. It is also argued that Silicon Valley already engages in online censorship of opinions they don’t agree with, and the repeal of the previous legislation will help ensure healthy competition. In a speech, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai notes : Returning to the legal framework that governed the Internet from President Clinton’s pronouncement in 1996 until 2015 is not going to destroy the Internet. It is not going to end the Internet as we know it. It is not going to kill democracy. It is not going to stifle free expression online. If stating these propositions alone doesn’t demonstrate their absurdity, our Internet experience before 2015, and our experience tomorrow, once this order passes, will prove them so. Blockchain Solutions With the overwhelming number of new ICOs emerging, there must be one that can tackle issues such as internet censorship and ISP control. Enter Substratum, a decentralized blockchain with, according to their website: … an open-source network that allows anyone to allocate spare computing resources to make the internet a free and fair place for the entire world. Participants running a Substratum node will get paid in cryptocurrency for serving content which helps to build a better and more open internet. Savvy crypto traders saw the opportunity, and the price of SUB shot up as the FCC news filtered out into the media. SUB tokens have been a flat line around $0.10 up until the end of November, at which point they started to climb. They spiked to an all-time high of $0.50 a few hours ago but have corrected to $0.40 at the time of writing. It is likely Substratum will see steady gains over the next day or so. What are your opinions on the repeal of the net neutrality rules passed during the Obama administration? Will Substratum help circumvent internet censorship? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	cryptocurrencies-death-regulation-strangulation	Cryptocurrencies: Death by Regulation Strangulation - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-09T04:30	A few Harvard professors feel that Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, will soon be a thing of the past as regulation efforts increase. With Bitcoin reaching $20k on some exchanges in December 2017, it’s hard to believe that it ever traded at laughable amounts like $5 in the years following its creation. Now there may not be a time machine on hand to take us back to purchase bitcoins at a cheaper price, but according to a few like-minded Harvard professors, we won’t need one! The Harvard Crimson reported that these experts believe that due to its unsustainability and the increase in regulation efforts, Bitcoin’s price will eventually drop to new lows before disappearing. Economics professor Kenneth S. Rogoff, who is also a cryptocurrency expert, believes that Bitcoin has its “near-anonymity” feature to thank for its high value. Because of this, the currency has been, and is seen as, the ideal medium of exchange to bankroll illicit undertakings such as drug dealing and unlicensed gun sales and purchases. No Invisibility Cloak for Bitcoin However, as government institutions pursue more aggressive regulation efforts, this high level of anonymity is under serious threat. Rogoff believes that anonymous Bitcoin users may soon be a thing of the past. He explained: Small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies would be desirable, [but] large-scale anonymous payments would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity. Touching on Japan’s legalization of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, Rogoff cautioned the risks of this adoption, which he says could result in the country “becoming a Switzerland-like tax haven, with bank-secrecy laws baked into the technology.” Government Needs to Relax Not all of Rogoff’s colleagues are of the same opinion, however. Jeffrey A. Miron, a libertarian economist who is also a professor at the university, had this to say about the assumption that Bitcoin is riskier than traditional fiat currency due to its lack of a paper trail: We’ve seen the transformation of all sorts of industries from being on paper or in some physical unit to being all electronic, and nothing bad has happened. Indeed, a lot of good stuff has happened. Miron went on to add: There’s no reason the government should be concerned about means of payment that are not regulated by the government. He also rubbished claims that Bitcoin is the go-to currency for drug dealers, saying that government-issued currencies were used “for centuries” before Bitcoin was even created. Aggressive Regulation However, Miron does believe that excessive regulation could spell the end of cryptocurrencies: It [government] could let cryptocurrencies peacefully exist, and not accept them as a means of payment, and that’s what I think it should do. But my guess is that sooner or later, governments are going to regulate cryptocurrencies out of existence. Rogoff also added his thoughts on the matter: What the private sector innovates, the state eventually regulates and appropriates. A New Era of State-Run Cryptos In addition, Rogoff believes that central banks will create state-controlled virtual currencies and will “use regulation to tilt the playing field until they win.” Based on the continued interest in these state-operated digital currencies, this year could see a dramatic increase in these developments. Venezuela will soon be issuing its Petro, Russia has plans for a CryptoRuble and Israel is also hoping to create a digital shekel. It seems as if instead of embracing decentralized, albeit disruptive, currencies, governments will try to centralize the industry by issuing strong regulations, while simultaneously taking advantage of the benefits of blockchain by developing their own cryptos. Do you think excessive regulations will end cryptocurrencies? Or will they continue to increase in value despite this? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of AdobeStock
bitcoinist	cryptocurrency-clampdown-approved-by-eu-to-fight-terrorism	Cryptocurrency Clampdown Approved by EU to Fight Terrorism - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-16T08:00	The European Union has agreed to a cryptocurrency clampdown to combat money laundering, tax evasion, and financing of terrorism. For a number of years, countries have grappled with ways to regulate cryptocurrency. The meteoric rise of Bitcoin over the course of 2017 has pushed such regulatory concerns to the forefront. Now the European Union (EU) has agreed to a cryptocurrency clampdown that will impact exchanges and wallets in order to combat terrorism, tax evasion, and money laundering. Reasons for the Clampdown The European Council and European Parliament agreed on a number of measures for their cryptocurrency clampdown. Apparently, the negotiations for these new regulations have been underway for a year and were brought about due to the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels in 2016. The opinion is that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were being used to finance terrorism, and the fact that virtual currencies offer a great deal of anonymity help such illicit funding. Vera Jourova, Europe’s Justice Commissioner, celebrated the new regulations, saying: Today’s agreement will bring more transparency to improve the prevention of money laundering and to cut off terrorist financing. Transparency International, a group dedicated to fighting corruption, also hailed the new regulations. They called the new rules a “breakthrough” and added: However, several loopholes remain, such as the lack of public access to information on the beneficiaries of trusts and similar arrangements. These loopholes should be addressed as EU Member States start to implement these revisions. Another reason for the new clampdown rules is to combat tax evasion. The publication of the Panama and Paradise Papers have shown that many celebrities, politicians, and businessmen have secretly funneled money to tax havens. Devil is in the Details So what are the details of this cryptocurrency clampdown ? First, cryptocurrency exchanges will have to identify their users, and the same goes for any wallet providers as well. Limits will be placed upon the use of pre-paid payment cards, which is due to the fact that authorities believe that they could have been used to fund militant attacks. Transparency requirements for trust owners and companies will be raised. National investigators will be allowed more access to information, and this access includes national bank account registers. The final bit of the new regulations is that access is granted to data on the beneficiaries of trusts to “persons who can demonstrate a legitimate interest.” Overall, these new cryptocurrency regulations are a massive blow to individual freedom, granting authorities increased access to private data. It seems that being anonymous will no longer be tolerated. The new cryptocurrency rules will need to be adopted by the various EU members within 18 months and enshrined into law. However, some countries are against the new regulations, including Malta, Luxembourg, Ireland, Cyprus, and Britain. Personally, I think that there’s a lot that the EU can do to combat terrorism and tax evasion without having to rip away some of the privacy features of cryptocurrency. But it seems that the only “transparency” that the EU bureaucrats really want in place is the privacy of cryptocurrency holders. What do you think about this cryptocurrency clampdown by the EU? Will it actually help stop terrorism or is this just a smokescreen? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay, Pxhere, and Bitcoinst archives.

Chances are, there’s somebody out there who knows exactly what they’re talking about and there’s no point in rephrasing that, which is already being articulated with perfect clarity. You’re not an American if you’re not afraid of housing bubbles, you’re not a capitalist if the current outlook of the financial sector doesn’t give you the chills, and you have no dog in the cryptocurrency fight if what’s happening with the market these last few days doesn’t concern you. But, when it comes to distinguishing, which bubble is “better” for us – financial, housing or tech – the Coindesk’s Managing editor Marc Hochstein makes a very precise point stating that: [The] housing market in the 2000s ultimately sparked a global financial crisis, leaving behind encumbrances. Tech bubbles, like the 1990s internet mania, leave behind infrastructure. Although one could argue that without the then-existing (granted, very much flawed) extensive housing infrastructure there could be no bubble, Hochstein’s line of logic deserves close attention because of who he is. He further draws undeniable parallels to the cryptocurrency market leaving us no room for doubt: we are in a bubble that is soon going to burst. And again, conceding to Hochstein, we agree that the current state of the crypto-economy is bound to bring us nothing but “steep financial losses, tears, layoffs, business failures, a funding drought, recriminations, pious editorials, lawsuits (meritorious and otherwise), prosecutions, congressional hearings, political grandstanding, unfunny “Saturday Night Live” skits, and burdensome new regulations.” But that’s where the bad news end. In our opinion, the moral of the Hochstein’s story is, in so many words, – watch out, which is something that’s been suggested from the very time the Bitcoin was established as an industry standard. If you’re already invested in the cryptocurrency market, it’s only smart to look for the best place to park your coins and to only participate in the most reputable and auspicious projects. We unequivocally agree that with the bad comes good and that the majority of the today’s ICOs will leave no track in posterity other than “souvenir white papers”, but that’s exactly why it has to fall to the knowledgeable, responsible, vigilant, and assertive cryptocurrency market specialists to discern the most promising projects and unveil them for the world. One social pursuit that’s poised for the betterment through blockchain technologies is online gambling, and the XWIN CryptoBet Ethereum-based betting platform seems to be just the solution for the many problems of the legacy online sports betting that are trying to crawl into the 21st century. Until recently, there was no meaningful approach to rectify such legacy nuisances as high commissions on bets, ambiguous permits and controversy in local legislation, unfair limits for successful players, lack of transparency and at the same time unsecured transactions leading to rampant identity theft, and many others. XWIN’s bid is to address them all through its token designed on the ERC20 protocol to generate guaranteed income through the distribution of 20% of the profit between token holders. It’s no wonder that the XWIN community is growing by the hour. The project is going strong, and not because of an overhyped novelty factor but because the team behind XWIN CryptoBet has the necessary know-how and experience to put it together. There are two seasoned award-winning cyber-entrepreneurs at the helm of the project who know exactly what it takes to put the right team together and how to bring in the right investor. As a result, we’re looking at the 8000 strong force of devotees that grew almost 100% within the last two months thanks to the obvious value of the end-product, by-the-book publicity efforts, and the assorted pre-ICO goodies. In fact, you’ve still got a real chance to participate in one of the very few ICOs that, going back to the Marc Hochstein’s theorem, rather than leaving behind encumbrances, will create the framework infrastructure for many generations of online sports bettors. The current token buying bonus is 10% but that only stands until Jan 23rd, whereupon the discount of 5% will be active all the way to the end of the ICO on January 31st. Images courtesy of XWIN
bitcoinist	cryptocurrency-investors-lose-tax-break	Cryptocurrency Investors Lose Major Tax Break Under New U.S. Tax Code	2017-12-25T15:30	The new U.S. tax code amends IRC Section 1031 (a)(1) regarding “like kind exchanges,” excluding all cryptocurrencies from a previous legal loophole and making all cryptocurrency trades a taxable event. On Friday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new tax bill into law, signalling the first major tax overhaul in the U.S. in over 30 years. And while you may or may not have high praise for the bill, one thing is certain: the new tax code is bad news for cryptocurrency investors. Starting Jan. 1st, 2018, all cryptocurrency trades will be a taxable event, including swapping one cryptocurrency for another. Closing the 1031 Loophole The recent overhaul amends a part of the tax code regarding exemptions for “like kind exchanges,” allowing investors to swap similar assets without triggering a tax event. These so-called “1031 exchanges” have long been used by traders to exchange property, such as art or real estate, without having to pay taxes on it. Since March 2014, the IRS has treated Bitcoin and other digital currencies as property for tax purposes. This makes them subject to capital gains tax, requiring taxes be paid whenever crypto is exchanged for fiat currency (ie. cash). Coins held for less than a year are subject to regular income tax, which can range anywhere from 10 to 37 percent, depending upon personal income levels. Coins held for longer than one year are subject to long-term capital gains tax, which caps at around 24 percent. However, it has never been clear whether a trade between two different cryptocurrencies qualifies as a “like kind exchange.” Up until this point, cryptocurrency trades have typically resided in this legal gray area, granting most traders a loophole for deferring taxes on short-term capital gains. However, the new amendment definitively narrows the 1031 exemption to only cover real estate swaps, excluding Bitcoin entirely. It specifically limits the scope of the law from previously covering “property” to now only covering “real property.” And as a digital asset, cryptocurrency is about as far from “real property” as one can get. The end result is that, starting next year, effectively all cryptocurrency trades will be taxed at the time of their execution, bringing an end to one of the most lucrative tax loopholes previously available to traders. Death, Taxes, and Cryptocurrency This change marks a significant blow for U.S. cryptocurrency investors. Although trades between fiat currency and crypto have previously been taxed, the vast majority of trading which occurs between separate cryptocurrencies has flown under the radar. Although traders are expected to pay taxes once they “cash out” or trade their coins for goods and services, swapping between cryptocurrencies has allowed investors to defer their tax obligation for short-term capital gains. Now investors will no longer be able to avoid income tax on these trades without holding onto a specific cryptocurrency for over a year. What remains to be seen is whether users will actually heed the law, as many U.S. investors already have an notoriously bad habit of avoiding taxes on their Bitcoin profits. From 2013 to 2015, the IRS discovered that fewer than 1,000 people in the U.S. had paid taxes on their bitcoins each year, prompting a controversial lawsuit against Coinbase, demanding they hand over all user transactions from those years. Tensions with the IRS will likely only get worse next year should Bitcoin investors continue to shirk their tax obligations. Gains of nearly $14,000 in Bitcoin this year alone will likely spell billions of dollars of missed tax revenue for the IRS should Americans choose to cheat the taxman again next spring. Do you think that the new amendment is fair towards Bitcoin users? What is your stance on taxing cryptocurrencies? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	cryptocurrency-market-cap-now-higher-jpmorgan-chase	Cryptocurrency Market Cap Now Higher than JPMorgan Chase - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-06T07:00	The total market cap for cryptocurrency went over $370 billon today, surpassing the market cap of JPMorgan Chase. Perhaps Jamie Dimon might have to eat some crow for Christmas. It may be time for Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, to get ready to start eating some humble pie. As everyone who’s interested in cryptocurrency knows, Dimon has really loathed Bitcoin, taking every opportunity he can to bash it. His constant bellyaching about Bitcoin has made him an object of ridicule in the crypto world. Well, the worm has finally turned as the total cryptocurrency market cap is now higher than that of JP Morgan Chase. The cryptocurrency market is now worth more than JPMorgan https://t.co/epwLpsoFOx — CNBC (@CNBC) December 6, 2017 Who’s Laughing Now? CNBC is reporting that, as of 6:50am London time, the total market value of all the various cryptocurrencies reached an all-time high of over $370 billion. The numbers are glorious to see, which you can view at Coinmarketcap. By comparison, the total market cap for JPMorgan is $366.8 billion. Back at an Institute of International Finance conference last October, Jamie Dimon had this to say about Bitcoin : I could care less what bitcoin trades for, how it trades, why it trades, who trades it. If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day. I’ve also told people that it can trade at $100,000 before it trades to zero. Tulip bulbs traded for $75,000 or something like that. Sweet, Sweet Revenge It’s fascinating to see how Jamie Dimon is so at odds with the actions of the bank he oversees, which just happens to be the largest bank in the United States. While Jamie Dimon badmouths Bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase has been getting more involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain world. It was just yesterday that one of JPMorgan’s main strategists declared that Bitcoin was now a legitimate asset due to the Bitcoin futures exchanges that are being opened by Cboe and CME. The strategist, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said the following: In all, the prospective introduction of bitcoin futures has the potential to elevate cryptocurrencies to an emerging asset class. The value of this new asset class is a function of the breadth of its acceptance as a store of wealth and as a means of payment and simply judging by other stores of wealth such as gold, cryptocurrencies have the potential to grow further from here. Overall, it’s looking to be a great holiday season as various cryptocurrencies continue to rocket up in value. Bitcoin burst through the $12,000 barrier, and IOTA has surged over 400% in just four days, becoming the #4 cryptocurrency by market cap. As for Jamie Dimon, I’m sure he’ll continue to act as a Scrooge whenever Bitcoin is mentioned. What do you think about the market cap for cryptocurrency surpassing JPMorgan? Will Jamie Dimon eat his words about Bitcoin? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of Bitcoinist archives, Flickr, and Twitter/CNBC.
bitcoinist	cryptocurrency-market-cap100-billion	Bitcoin & Cryptocurrencies Resume Rally, Market Cap Nears $100 Billion - Bitcoinist.com	2017-06-05T08:00	The global cryptocurrency market cap has passed the $94 billion mark, breaking its previous record, nearing the $100 billion milestone. Cryptocurrency Market Resumes Rally The cryptocurrency market is on a wild ride heading north and approaching $100 billion USD. Its market capitalization has broken its previous all-time high of roughly $90.7 billion, which was followed by a accentuated pullback that wiped out nearly $30 billion in value. Currently sitting at $94.6 billion, it has grown nearly 30% since last Monday. In other words, the crypto market has lost $30 billion in value only to regain it back, plus $4 billion more in a period of less than two weeks. The general coin market cap continues to pull ahead of famous startups like Uber ($68B), Didi Chuxing ($50b), Airbnb ($31B), Xiaomi ($46B), and many others. If the trend continues, next to be passed are the likes of Starbucks ($94.7B), BP ($117B), McDonalds ($125B), and MasterCard ($134B). Although Bitcoin still maintains a 48.8% dominance over the general cryptocurrency market, altcoins continue to grow at a faster pace. While the cryptocurrency market cap has grown more than 434% this year, Bitcoin has registered a growth of 167%. Ethereum, on the other hand, has grown more than 2,884% since the beginning of the year and its market cap is now more than half of Bitcoin’s. Six days ago, Ether also beat Bitcoin in 24-hour trading volume, registering over $1.2 billion in trading volume. What’s Fueling the Crypto Market? The cryptocurrency rally seems to be driven by multiple factors. While the U.S. is currently experiencing an upsurge in the demand for Bitcoin, possibly due to the political uncertainty in the country, demand is also growing rapidly in Asia. In Japan, in particular, the newly passed law has granted Bitcoin recognition as a legal form of payment in the country, increasing demand and merchant adoption. In South Korea, demand is also accelerating with the Bitcoin trading at premiums that have reached over 40%. In China, the reactivation of cryptocurrency withdrawals has boosted the trading volume to 20% of the global BTC market. Initial Coin Offerings, a new phenomenon in crowdfunding, are also driving millions of dollars in investments every week towards the cryptoshpere and amassing higher market caps in smaller timeframes. Most recently, the Basic Attention Token (BAT) ICO, received $30 million in a matter of seconds, while the Aragon project getting $20 million in roughly 15 minutes. Not only are average citizens turning to crypto, but traditional investors are too. Last week, Hargreaves Lansdown, UK’s most popular investment platform, announced that it will allow its clients to invest in Bitcoin. Fidelity Investments has also announced that customers will be able to view their Coinbase holdings. Last month, CNBC also advised investors to consider Bitcoin as an investment stating that it “may look attractive as a sort of safe-haven trade.” Bubble or Just The Beginning? Although the current rally presents some of the typical characteristics of a bubble, opinions vary. While the recent pull back may have resembled the Bitcoin crash in 2013/2014, the fast-paced recovery took the global cryptocurrency market cap to a new alt-time high of $94.6b, dispelling signs of a possible bull trap. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies still have a long way to go in order to reach the mainstream stage, however. Recent developments in the cryptocurrency space make for a bright future ahead, such as the prospect of a resolution for the Bitcoin scaling debate, government interest in blockchain technology, the increase in VC and crowdfunding investments, and the implementation permissive regulations for cryptocurrencies. However, it is also worth noting that the accentuated growth of so many cryptocurrencies may be unsustainable and, in the end, some or even all may be left behind as failed or abandoned projects. Will cryptocurrencies continue to surge to new heights? Is Bitcoin bound to lose its dominance in the cryptosphere? Let us know what you think in the comment section.

bitcoinist	cryptocurrency-marketcap-uber-airbnb	Global Cryptocurrency Market is Now Bigger Than Uber, Airbnb, Xiaomi	2017-05-22T10:30	The global cryptocurrency market cap has now blown through that of famous startups like Uber, Didi Chuxing, Airbnb, Xiaomi, and many others. Global Cryptocurrency Market cap As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gain traction throughout the world, more money keeps pouring from traditional markets into the cryptosphere. Breaking record highs during the weekend, Bitcoin, Ethereum and others have grown to unprecedented values, adding roughly $25 billions to the global crypto market cap in the last two days. Currently sitting just under $80 billion, the global cryptocurrency market cap has now blown through that of famous startups like Uber ($68B), Didi Chuxing ($50b), Airbnb ($31B), Xiaomi ($46B), and many others. Although there is still a long way to go to reach the value of giants like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, this marks a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency progress. The continuous rally in the crypto markets is believed to be mostly connected to the recent Japanese law, in which cryptocurrencies are considered as legal payment methods exempt of consumer tax. Not only that but in the midst of political uncertainty and as the traditional market continues to plummet, investors are looking for safe-haven properties that are often provided by gold and now by cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, Bitcoin and altcoins are completely new to most average investors and represent a certain level of technical challenge. However, cryptocurrencies are actually much easier and cheaper to access than the traditional market. Buying stock in these startups is no easy task, as opposed to buying Bitcoin or altcoins, which is also a driving factor in the cryptocurrency rally. As one Reddit user noted: People are constantly whining about how hard it is to buy Bitcoin, but try buying into an IPO for one of those startups or just shares off the market. It’s not impossible, but it’s not cheap and it’s not easy. Relatively, crypto has a very low barrier of entry and you can trade as little or as much as you want. There’s no substantial minimum trade cost and fees are near enough to zero to have no impact. Bitcoin Dominance In the last month, the cryptocurrency landscape has changed drastically, gathering over $40 billion in market cap and doubling in size In time, Bitcoin has been losing its share of the crypto market at an accelerating rate. Even though Bitcoin is still the “top dog” with a market dominance of roughly 46%, the change in market cap distribution represents an important shift in the cryptocurrency scene, one that may not be great for Bitcoin itself, but that is certainly great for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Bitcoin is likely to remain the leader in terms of coin market cap, given its broader application as a currency (and not as an appcoin or asset) and the relative advantages it has over other currencies such as security, immutability, and decentralization. However, this change demonstrates that investors are becoming more knowledgeable about blockchain technology in general. Additionally, many newcomers are probably also investing in alternative cryptocurrencies with the hopes of catching the next wave after failing to buy bitcoin for double and even triple digit prices. Lastly, this shift in dominance may also be connected to the pressing capacity issues that Bitcoin is facing, preventing it from keeping up the growth of other coins that have yet to face their own scaling challenges down the road. Paradigm Shift or Bubble? Although this unprecedented rally is certainly a reason for excitement, many members of the community have voiced their concerns regarding the possibility that we are currently experiencing a bubble similar to the one experienced in 2013, which as we all know, had disastrous results. Some are even comparing the current Poloniex situation with Mt.Gox back then, given the recent suspicion that Poloniex is manipulating the markets, an idea that isn’t so far-fetched since Poloniex comprises the majority volume on the most valuable altcoins. The cryptocurrency surge presents signs that can be interpreted from multiple sides. While it is possible to present logical and compelling arguments for many theories, the truth is that cryptocurrencies are a completely new asset class. In other words, no one can predict how this nascent market will behave, especially in the information and internet age. One thing is certain, however, there is still a long way to go to reach mainstream adoption. Therefore, we could just be getting starting. To give you an idea, the current global cryptocurrency market cap would have to grow tenfold to reach that of Apple. While Bitcoin itself would have to be worth roughly $46,000 USD to have the same marketcap as Apple or roughly $700 billion. What do you think? Are we in a bubble? Will Bitcoin lose its position as the top cryptocurrency? Share your views on the comment section! Images courtesy of coinmarketcap, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	cryptocurrency-price-surge-lead-hacked-smart-homes	Cryptocurrency Price Surge Could Lead to Hacked Smart Homes - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-09T10:30	A security expert says that rising cryptocurrency prices can lead to a surge in cryptojacking of people’s smart homes. If there’s one thing that movies have educated us on, it’s that there’s always some form of unintended consequences when it comes to new technology. Usually this comes in the form of horrific doom as mankind is wiped out by killer robots or some terrible plague. Yet there are some unforeseen events that can occur as people begin to accept and embrace something that appears initially mundane, such as smart appliances in one’s home. One interesting possibility with some slightly sinister overtones is that a person’s smart home could be attacked via cryptojacking due to the exploding price in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Increased Tech Means Increased Vulnerability Technology has become an integral part of our everyday lives, from smart phones to streaming movies at home. The normal person looks to harness the power of technology to make their life easier and more fulfilling, but others look to harness technology to put money in their pockets. While such an attitude isn’t a bad thing on the surface, the method that they use to do so can be. Case in point is people hijacking the tech of others to surreptitiously mine cryptocurrency. The increasing value of cryptocurrency means that it can be very profitable to mine crypto, especially if you’re not paying for the equipment or power to do so. One common means that illicit miners use is to slip some code onto a website to harness the computers of those visiting the site. A popular choice is the Coin Hive malware that has been found on many sites, including that of the UFC. Without any consent or knowledge, your computer could be tasked to mine for some crypto. However, such mining hacks don’t end there. Your smart phone may be infected as well. 2017 saw a 34% surge in mobile apps that featured code for mining cryptocurrencies. Even the insanely popular Facebook Messenger app was found to have been infected with a crypto mining hack. Now this illicit mining can even have an impact upon your home. Home Sweet Home The latest possible target, according to some security experts, for illicit crypto miners is your smart home. It seems that smart devices can be the target of cryptojacking, where your internet-connected appliances could be used to mine various virtual currencies. Such devices can include light bulbs, cameras, and even thermostats. The director of advisory services for EMEA at cyber security firm IOActive, Neil Haskins, told The Independent : Any device that is ‘smart’ now has the three key ingredients to provide the cyber bad guy with everything they need – internet access, power and processing. I can introduce my crypto-mineware via a compromised mobile phone and start to exploit the processing power of your home devices to mine bitcoin. The results can be massively higher energy costs for the home owner. The really bad part is that they’re still on the hook for it as the power is being used. The insidious part is that such illicit crypto mining could go on for months without being detected. Who checks to see if their smart refrigerator is being used to mine Monero or some other cryptocurrency? Haskins says that there are some ways to protect one’s home. He says that consumers should demand a security rating in addition to a smart appliance’s power efficiency. He also adds: In the meantime, consider the entry point for most cyber bad guys. Generally, this is your desktop, laptop or mobile device. Therefore, ensure you have suitable security products running on these devices, make sure they are patched to the correct levels, and be conscious of the websites you are visiting. If you control the available entry points, you will go a long way to protecting your home. The bad news is that some crook could cost you a higher energy bill while he makes bank off of your home through cryptojacking your smart devices. On the plus side, at least your smart home won’t be going berserk and trying to kill you like in a horror movie. How possible is it for the average person to safeguard their smart home from illicit crypto miners? Are you worried about your home? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	cryptocurrency-trading-without-the-complexities-with-symmetry-fund	Cryptocurrency Trading Without the Complexities with Symmetry Fund - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-15T23:00	One of the problems facing those new to the cryptocurrency markets is the level of complexity in using exchanges and making trades. Some degree of technical knowledge is required to open, navigate and trade on a crypto exchange account, get one thing wrong and your virtual currency disappears into the ether. Symmetry Fund aims to alleviate the digital distress by offering a balanced cryptocurrency and ICO investment fund. Crypto investment funds are the best way for those new to the industry or those a little shy on technical expertise to get into the markets. If can be a challenge to learn all of the new terminologies and determine which of the hundreds of cryptos would be the best investment. In addition to offering a balanced portfolio across a range of altcoins and early stage ICOs Symmetry Fund is managed, meaning that they are doing the work so you don’t have to. Fund Benefits The team behind the fund is backed by a team with a strong background in mutual funds and over 30 years of experience. CEO Andre Levin has worked in classic fund management for many years, which included time at Franklin Templeton Investments, Baillie Gifford, and Credit Suisse. Instead of using the traditional method of charging a set percentage of the portfolio annually, Symmetry Fund is performance based which means they only benefit when their clients do. The fund is unique in that, when not in a trade, cryptocurrencies will be held in fiat to mitigate risks from highly volatile market movements. This ensures that the entire fund is not exposed at any one time and there is a prudent reserve to prevent the effects of large and rapid price fluctuations. The entire fund will have full transparency and shareholders will be self-certified on a daily basis in order to track progress. Shareholders will also be able to vote on the direction of SYMM and count towards decisions such as the portion dedicated to ICO investment and that is traded on currency pairs. Symmetry Fund ICO The tokenized fund will be based on the Ethereum platform and SYMM tokens will be available during the ICO. Ethereum was chosen over other networks as it has an existing support base and is the stable choice for many new blockchain products. Unlike most other coins an unlimited amount of SYMM will be made available during the ICO which will have two rounds. The first round began on December 10 and is currently running until February 10, the second will run from Feb 11 to April 10. Tokens are priced at 0.1 ETH each and will represent a single share in the fund which will be powered by most of the capital raised in the ICO. According to the white paper, 70% of the fund will be invested in BTC, LTC, DAS, ETH, and XRP with 20% going into high potential ICOs. Up to 10% will be held back for administration and prudent reserves. Management fees depend on the amount of investment. During round 1 all investments will be managed at 7.5%. For round 2 investments over 100 ETH in SYMM shares will remain at this rate while those under 100 ETH will be charged 15% management fee. The fund will move into the trading phase once the ICO has completed, tokens can then be withdrawn and converted back into fiat if desired. SYMM will then be coming to some of the world’s major exchanges shortly after where it can be traded openly. When the fund makes a profit, dividends will be paid to investors in ETH. Profits are determined by subtracting the amount the fund was worth at the end of the previous month from what the fund is worth at the start of the current month, less management fees if applicable. No management fees will be charged when there is no profit. In 2017 people could invest in crypto and make huge gains themselves, however, when market regulation starts to happen, as it will this year, those volatile price shifts will not be so common. This is when a professionally managed fund will make the difference and the team can adjust to new market conditions quickly.

bitcoinist	cryptograffiti-buy-fraction-bitcoin	'You Can Buy a Fraction of a Bitcoin' Has Started The Most Conversations - Cryptograffiti - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-03T07:00	Bitcoinist spoke with Cryptograffiti, who runs one of the most popular crypto art design and merchandise companies in the space under the same name. Cryptograffiti reveals what is the most popular design and explains why art is so important in educating the public even in a hi-tech field like Bitcoin. Bitcoinist: First, do I refer to you as Cryptograffiti or do you have a name? Cryptograffiti (CG): Cryptograffiti works! Bitcoinist: How did you first get into Bitcoin and did you have the “Aha!” moment? CG: In late 2011, I needed a gift for a developer helping me out with a startup. He was into Bitcoin and RC planes and so my first crypto-related “art” was a shirt design of a flying Bitcoin symbol with a propeller on top. This was before I knew much at all about Bitcoin. In the fall of 2012 I had a series of ‘Aha’ moments all in one night that had me in awe. One in particular was a forum describing how by charging a fraction of a penny per email, providers could price out spammers. Another thread discussed how micro-payments could curb brute force password attacks. I started thinking about how micropayments could be applied to the art world and down the rabbit hole I went. Next thing I knew the sun was coming up and my back hurt from being hunched over the computer for hours on end. Bitcoinist: What inspired you to start cryptograffiti? CG: I wanted to dive into the space but needed a way to contribute. Everyone always said I should do something with my art and this seemed perfect. Bitcoinist: What do you think you would be doing instead if Bitcoin didn’t exist? CG: I have an idea for a startup that involves comments that I’d love to have more time to pursue, so probably that. Bitcoinist: Has it made it possible to pursue your dream of being a full-time artist? CG: Yes, I just can’t believe how lucky I am. Being an artist in and of itself is like a dream for me. Having it be movement-related adds another layer of passion. And to now have that movement doing well? I seriously can’t even sleep. The bags under my eyes have bags…and a little coin purse. Bitcoinist: How big is the cryptograffiti team? CG: Just me. I need advice on expanding. Bitcoinist: So do you create all the designs, shirts etc. by yourself? CG: Yeah, I’m up to ~70 designs (now in Women’s!). I make them when I’m procrastinating a fine art project. There’s also a couple coin logos up there I didn’t make, but from projects I agreed to help out as they needed merch and don’t have a store. Bitcoinist: What would you say is your company’s ethos? In other words, what message do you want to broadcast to the public with your merchandise? CG: Well my art, as well the merch, is all about spreading the movement…awareness. I see each shirt as little mini billboards. And I think it’s important to bring a little humor into the mix even with something as important and disruptive as cryptocurrency/blockchain. I see each shirt as little mini billboards. Bitcoinist: How do you come up with your ideas? CG: Usually a mix of crypto twists on the status quo, memes and current events. Bitcoinist: What is your most favorite design, shirt, etc. to date? CG: YOU CAN BUY A FRACTION OF A BITCOIN has started the most conversations. I recently wore it to the gym and this JACKED…like 350 lb. dude with neck tats came up to me and I thought he was going to tell me to get off his rack or something but he said, “Nice shirt. So, what do you think? Is OmiseGo gonna correct?” But, usually it’s someone saying “I didn’t know that (you could buy a fraction).” Bitcoinist: What has been your best selling item so far? CG: The stickers and “Because Fuck Banks” shirt. Bitcoinist: The crypto space is populated by exchanges, wallets, media, consulting firms etc. Do you think art plays an equally important role in the crypto movement? CG: Throughout history, art has played a pivotal role in spreading movements. This space is especially important as the subject matter can be complex for the general public. Art helps distill the message down to something more can understand. [Art] in this space is especially important as the subject matter can be complex for the general public. Earlier this year, I had an exhibit at Digital Garage in downtown San Francisco that attracted all walks of life. I would explain cryptocurrency through the art hanging in the gallery. It felt like people were more open to asking me questions than they might be a dev. Bitcoinist: Certainly, the symbolism and designs you create can be just as powerful, if not more, than press coverage, marketing etc.? Do you agree? CG: I think so. It’s the whole a picture is worth a thousand words. Bitcoinist: What are your future plans? Will you be expanding your product offerings? CG: I’m getting to a point where I probably need to hire help for the merch. To be honest, it was really just a way to keep the lights on while I ramped up the fine art. And now I’m fortunate that both are doing well and I really would prefer to focus on art. I’m typing this next to 200 piggy banks that will soon meet their demise with a hammer. And I have a bank’s stack of bills complete with dye pack that I’m looking forward to incorporating into a piece. Lots of stuff in the works, but I can’t help myself…I’m addicted to these damn shirts. Bitcoinist: Looking forward to see your new designs. Anything else you’d like to add?

bitcoinist	danish-hockey-player-athlete-bitcoin	Danish Hockey Player Becomes First Pro Athlete to Get Paid in Bitcoin	2017-12-15T08:00	A Danish Bitcoin billionaire has signed a sponsorship deal with a Danish ice hockey club, where one player will become the first to receive his salary in Bitcoin only, as the team’s venue will get renamed to Bitcoin Arena. Out With Rungsted, In With Bitcoin As the Swiss crypto platform confirmed Wednesday, Bitcoin Suisse’s Niklas Nikolajsen has entered into a three-year package with Rungsted Seier Capital, replacing previous sponsor, Bitcoin-friendly Saxo Privatbank. “The sponsorship is a 3-year contract, starting with a gala-event and match on December 27th 2017, and from this date forward the Rungsted Arena will be named the Bitcoin Arena,” a press release states. Once it has taken over, Bitcoin Suisse plans to install cryptocurrency ATMs, along with a giant centerpiece of a physical bitcoin. It will also pay its top player in Bitcoin. “Top Rungsted player Nikolaj Rosenthal will pioneer the switch from traditional salary payments in Danish Kroner to become the first professional sports athlete to be paid fully and exclusively in Bitcoin, paving the way for others in- and outside of the world of professional sports to do the same,” the release announces. Bitcoin’s ‘First’ Premier League Gig Bitcoin’s entry into professional sport has barely gone beyond the plethora of online betting outlets which have sprung up in recent years. Legitimized sponsorship is likely easier to swallow at this point in 2017 as public awareness of and interest in Bitcoin has soared, lending it a ‘bonafide’ status which was previously hard to deliver. Days after the announcement, Bitcoin was hitting new all-time price highs once again, climbing towards $18,000 per coin. “This is the first time ever a crypto-financial company will sponsor a national premier league professional sports team,” Bitcoin Suisse continues. The determination, effort and hard work, which took the Rungsted Seier Capital hockey team from being an outsider to one of the strongest teams in the league is something we can very much identify with from the side of Bitcoin Suisse. What do you think about Bitcoin Suisse’s sponsorship of Rungsted Seier Capital? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, bitcoinsuisse.ch
bitcoinist	darkcoin-the-words-truly-instantaneous-and-untraceable-digital-currency	Darkcoin – the word’s truly instantaneous and untraceable digital currency - Bitcoinist.com	2014-11-04T05:03	Privacy has been one of the most desired features in digital currencies that bitcoin hasn’t been able to offer. Evan Duffield is a software developer that has been on a quest to create a crypto currency that he hopes will soon be the perfect internet cash: untraceable and instantaneous. Early this year he created Darkcoin – believed to be the first true anonymous, secure and untraceable crypto currency. Unlike Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based alt-coins which have transparent electronic transactions, Darkcoin can be equated with online cash due to its private/anonymous transactions that resemble the anonymity of private cash transactions. To achieve this, Duffield has developed two key technologies in the form of DarkSend, which promises the first truly anonymous web transactions, and InstantX, which validates transactions in the same amount of time as it takes a credit card to process around 20 to 30 seconds. The developer says darkcoin is trying to be just like cash, except with this type of “internet-cash” people can freely trade over the internet. Bitcoin has many flaws due to its lack of anonymity and lengthy transaction times, and that led to hundreds of copycat cryptocurrencies emerging attempting to overcome these flaws; however, until now, none have fully succeeded. Darkcoin has appeared with the promise of solving the problem of complete anonymity; nevertheless it is going to attract users with nefarious intentions. Darkcoin is already being accepted throughout major online black marketplaces operating on the dark. Unlike bitcoin, it comes with anonymous features and faster transactions. Black market use may be an inevitable outcome of darkcoin’s anonymity, but for Duffield it is a different product like cash itself, which can also be used in street blackmarkets. Duffield stresses that darkcoin is about providing privacy to protect users from government snooping, corporate involvement, and against criminals seeking to exploit payment information. In a closer look we might consider that this can be a sign of a much wider adoption that could lead darkcoin into a rise the same way bitcoin did. Duffield said. “If we make something that is way easier to secure and anonymise, and faster to spend, then I’m sure that will draw in an amount of people that want to use it for illicit activities. That’s the way that bitcoin started and it eventually moved away from that and more into legitimate areas, so I’m guessing that darkcoin will go the same route. I don’t support the black markets or anything like that; I’m developing this purely from the standpoint of privacy. We’ve no idea how much information the block chain is going to illuminate about a specific person in 10 years time. Because these block chains never go away. It’ Privacy for perfectly good reasons! We’re not trying to do this to build an easier way to buy drugs online, we’re doing this to provide users with an incredible amount of privacy.” By way of mitigating against any potential involvement with the criminal aspect that darkcoin and its technologies may throw up, the cryptocurrency’s website offers its own disclaimer, stating: “By using this software you agree to not use it for illegal purposes and not to hold us responsible for any lost darkcoin.” The Superintendent of Financial Services for New York and the man behind the proposed BitLicense regulations for cryptocurrency, Ben Lawsky, fears that innovations like those brought about by darkcoin will be providing a breeding ground for criminals. The Dark web The dark web is another layer of the internet that is not indexed by search engines such as Google, and it cannot be easily navigated using a standard web browser. Accessing the dark web is not an easy task; it requires specialized knowledge and specific software tools. Its content is only accessible by using the Tor software and anonymity network, which while protecting privacy, is in most cases associated with illicit activities. The Dark Web, also known as the deep web, invisible web, and dark net, consists of web pages and data that are beyond the reach of search engines. Some of what makes up the Deep Web consists of abandoned, inactive web pages, but the majority of data that lies within have been crafted to deliberately avoid detection in order to remain anonymous. The low inflation characteristics allow Darkcoin to increase store of wealth properties compared to other coins. The same characteristic also ensures that the coin’s price stays significantly more protected from the selling of daily mining production from those who are interested in acquiring bitcoins through altcoin mining. Despite the fact that Darkcoin and its anonymity features are often associated with criminal activities, Darkcoin has all the tools and features to become the most used digital currency in the web.

bitcoinist	dash-bitcoin-interview-amanda-b-johnson	How Dash Stole Bitcoin’s Mojo - Interview with Amanda B. Johnson	2017-03-19T24:00	It’s Sunday morning, and even though it is almost Spring, it feels like Groundhog Day. I look at the markets and Bitcoin is down another 9% while Dash is up another 10%. This two-step has been playing out for the last three days now. I have questions, and I need answers…. Dashing to $1 Billion Dollar Market Cap As the fork debate seems headed for a messy, unfortunate conclusion, Dash is cleaning up in the digital currency space. According to CoinMarketCap, this weekend alone, Dash has set new highs in unit price, exceeding $120 USD, and market cap value, surpassing $860 million dollars. Before this month, the most it could generate was about $200 million in overall market value. The market has spoken and Dash is the play right now. With that in mind, I decided to catch up with former Bitcoin scribe and colleague and current Dash reporter and presenter Amanda B. Johnson to get the inside scoop. Here Dash Detailed YouTube channel tells the world what’s going on, with the latest interviews with network executives and updates on future Dash protocol offerings. If anyone has their finger on the pulse of this March Madness in Dash, it is Amanda. I started out with a tough question that many have been asking me over the last few weeks. Why shouldn’t people see Dash as the next manipulated “pump-and-dump?” Shouldn’t people be worried about dash moving so far, so fast? Her opinion is that Dash is an old investment that has finally hit its stride, after three years on the market. Evan Duffield and its developers have been on this project for over three years, so there is no hit-and-run strategy, like with your common digital hustle. Dash’s growing empire wasn’t made overnight. This is a fair point, since Ethereum has been around for less than two years and is over four times more valuable, overall. No one is accusing Vitalik Buterin of trying to deceive anyone for a quick profit. So where is all of this Dash investment coming from? More places than you might think, says Johnson. Some of the new investment is from disillusioned Bitcoiners, yes. But not all, and maybe not even most. As an example of where new investment may be coming from, Dash has recently been featured in investor newsletters catering to a non-crypto crowd, namely Casey Research, Bill Bonner Research, and The Dollar Vigilante. We’ve also been covered in Nasdaq, PaymentWeek, and Finance Magnates, among others. The market seems to indicate this is directly correlated to Bitcoin’s misfortune, at least during this week, but Dash’s group has also stepped up their marketing game in Q1, as well, obviously gaining some mainstream publicity. Dash started the year trading at just $11 USD, and did triple in value in the first two months of the year, before this fork debate went viral. They also recently inked a deal with Wall of Coins, increasing their brand’s reach. Now that more people than ever before are investing in the Dash protocol, it might be time to go over the infrastructure, for those new to this currency system. Dash has always looked to be a more private alternative to Bitcoin’s more public and accessible blockchain information. Bitcoin’s internal security is legendary, but Dash’s network protection is nothing to sneeze at, either. I asked Amanda how their “Masternodes” can protect the greater good, and not just their own self-interests, which seems to be a growing problem for Bitcoin miners. “Dash’s masternodes have already withstood a sophisticated DDoS (external attack) and are also primed to withstand attempts at social engineering (internal attack),” she explains. “This is due to two facts about masternodes: firstly, they’re paid 45% of our block reward. This serves as an incentive to remain online and operational in spite of external attacks. Secondly, masternodes must both prove a stake (1000 Dash) and prove their service in order to vote on protocol changes. It is very much in their self-interest to serve the interests of our end users, as the value of their Dash is at stake.” DASH DOING WHAT BITCOIN IS NOT Bitcoin has also been accused of being more centralized than one would think. Is Dash doing a better job of creating a digital democracy, in a fight against all forms of centralization? Dash has only one remaining element of centralization. In Dash, ‘sporks’ are various capabilities on the network — like InstantSend, for example — that can be turned on or off during software updates in order to prevent accidental forks. Sporks are currently executable only by a handful of key holders on the Core team. Version 0.12.2 of Dash is set to move that capability to master node vote, however, making it decentralized. It’s a fix that definitely needs to happen for our continued security. While the Bitcoin community is wondering where it goes from here, the leadership at Dash is spending their days worrying about what to do with all of this newfound capital investment. In a Dash Detailed recent episode, their Director of Finance, Ryan Taylor, listed that as the #1 problem right now. Attracting new “talent” and expanding is needed, and now they at least have the money to put into their back-end operational budget. They’re not an afterthought anymore. Dash is now sitting at the main table with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Is it the pretty girl with the curl? The flavor of the day? Or is it the Bitcoin 2.0, going through a growth curve not dissimilar to what Bitcoin went through in 2013? Both options are now on the table, and it’s up to you to decide its future. Or maybe it is up to the Bitcoin miners? Welcome to March Madness! We still have 12 days left. A lot can change in (the last) three days, much less twelve. Is Dash becoming a viable alternative to Bitcoin? Share your thoughts below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, dash.org, thedashtimes
bitcoinist	dash-funds-blockchain-research-arizona-state-university	Dash Funds Blockchain Research at Arizona State University - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-18T19:30	Blockchain research is set to get a cash injection from Dash as the cryptocurrency collaborates with the Arizona State University’s Blockchain Research Laboratory. As blockchain awareness continues to grow, more and more industries are realizing that it could be a viable solution in their business. However, as with any evolving technology, time and effort need to be put into researching its mainstream benefits. Dash Offers Financial Support for Blockchain Research In November last year, Arizona State University (ASU) entered into a collaboration with Dash, a top-20 cryptocurrency with a market cap of just over $6.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The self-funding crypto offers many distinctive characteristics, including instant and private transactions through its InstantSend and PrivateSend features respectively. According to AZ Big Media, the move came after Dash donated $50k to the ASU’s Blockchain Research Laboratory (BRL) in August last year. The partnership will introduce the Dash Scholars Program, which will provide $100k to fund undergraduate and graduate research fellowships, and open source projects. The program will also contribute $100k to the BRL and $50k to the Luminosity Lab and blockchain course development. In addition, $100k will be allocated to an ASU online graduate course scheduled for this fall. Back to School: Dash brings Blockchain scholarship to Arizona State University – https://t.co/flJdqzLRQ7 pic.twitter.com/ZV8OvHj60i — LeapRate (@LeapRate) January 17, 2018 BRL Hopes to Foster Mainstream Blockchain Integration Dragan Boscovic, director of BRL and a research professor in ASU’s School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering, expressed his excitement for the collaboration: ASU welcomes this initiative and is ready to play its role in creating a potent blockchain research and innovation environment for young talents to develop practical blockchain applications. Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core, is also looking forward to what the venture will offer: This is a remarkable partnership precisely because both sides will benefit greatly from tight collaboration. Dash benefits from gaining valuable independent insights into how we can improve our plans for scaling to massively large numbers of transactions. ASU will benefit from gaining access to one of the most innovative teams in the digital currency industry. The entire blockchain industry will benefit from the best practices that will emerge from the research, and the creation of a graduate course is a tremendous leap in blockchain’s path towards rapid, mainstream adoption. Even though blockchain will always be the underlying technology for virtual currencies, the BRL hopes to focus on implementing it into other industries such as the financial sector and contract-based businesses currently making use of intermediaries. The BRL also includes other professionals such as faculty members from the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering whose Dean, Kyle Squires, had this to say: The Blockchain Research Lab not only offers students early access to blockchain technologies that are transforming the nature of business transactions, it is providing them an opportunity to be part of the design process and a unique opportunity for real-world innovation and design. Do you think that 2018 will see more mainstream businesses adopting blockchain technology? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of ASU/Flickr

David shares some insights into the event and speaks on behalf of the company’s continuing education partnership with Inside Bitcoins. Also Read : Interview: David Berger, Digital Currency Council (DCC) President At Inside Bitcoins New York, David Berger will speak in two separate sessions. His first session is titled, “The Pros and Cons of Bitcoin Investing.” David will speak in a second session titled, “Accelerating Bitcoin Adoption: Influencing the Influencers.” Accelerating Bitcoin Adoption David Berger sheds some light on bitcoin adoption and what could potentially accelerate bitcoin adoption the most: “While Satoshi’s ‘system for electronic transactions without relying on trust’ has proven to be a robust technological innovation, our data shows that trust in the ecosystem is actually integral to Bitcoin’s adoption. High profile negligence and malfeasance has eroded the public’s trust in the Bitcoin brand. Yes, there is regulatory risk and easy to use applications are critical, but people simply won’t engage with Bitcoin unless they trust the people sitting atop it. The true professionals in the Bitcoin ecosystem must step up and establish that trust.” DCC Continuing Education Partnership with Inside Bitcoins The DCC is the leading provider of digital currency-related training, certification, and continuing education. It has taken on the task of educating and equipping professionals with the knowledge they need to be successful in their Bitcoin pursuits, making the Council an igniting force in the Bitcoin community. David Berger: “The DCC is proud to be collaborating with cutting edge organizations like Inside Bitcoins on continuing education for our members. While our online certification curriculum provides an excellent baseline understanding of the 6 core competencies of a digital currency professional, there is always more to learn in this rapidly evolving ecosystem.

bitcoinist	devery-io-token-sale-reaches-10-million-target-within-17-seconds	Devery.io Token Sale Reaches $10 Million Target Within 17 Seconds - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-22T23:45	Devery.io, the developers of the Devery Protocol, is set to provide a decentralized verification platform, marking and tracking items over the Ethereum blockchain. Their Token sale reached their hard cap funding target within 17 seconds of lifting the individual cap. Devery.io, founded by Andrew Rasheed, held their token sale on January 12 this year and was able to reach their targets without any institutional funding whatsoever, something they actively rejected as being unfair to the broader range of contributors. The presale discount was a maximum of 5% with a 1% referral program. They did not change their discount even though they were offered multiple millions of dollars in contributions, focusing on making the token sale fair for all contributors. On reaching their token sale targets, Devery released the following tweet: The Devery token sale sold out in 17 seconds after caps were lifted! We are astounded by the overwhelming support – Big thanks to the community and @ParityTech for their support. We look forward to the future of the project. 😀 #devery #ethereum #token #EVE — Devery.io (@deveryofficial) January 19, 2018 Devery’s Vision to Document Supply Chains and Battle The Counterfeit Goods Industry The Devery.io project focuses on the global e-commerce market, which is worth trillions of dollars annually. One of the major issues related to e-commerce is trust – consumers simply have to trust that the items they sold are as described, whether that be size or that the item is genuine. Counterfeit goods account for billions of dollars in lost revenue for companies per year. Devery.io is aiming to change this by allowing a transparent supply chain, and item tracking. All this would be done through Devery’s innovative protocol and application, Devery ensures that customers receive the goods they are actually promised, tracked across the entire supply chain to guarantee it. Businesses can mark their products with unique identifiers stored and distributed via EVE tokens to verify products across their entire supply chain, helping them to maintain their brand and products. Retailers and consumers can also verify their products and their authenticity with the token’s unique markers. Devery’s goal is to provide the de facto product verification standard for online goods. Devery CrowdSale and EVE Tokens Devery launched their crowdsale on January 18, 2018, reaching their hard cap of $10 million within 17 seconds of lifting the individual cap. The total supply of 100 million EVE tokens have been distributed as follows: 60% through their the crowdsale 20% held in Devery reserves 15% allocated for founders and advisors 5% held for future contributors to the project What Is Next For Devery? In 2018 the company is focused on onboarding partnerships and launching a live trial of the system with customers using their software sometime in Q1. Version 1.0 of their software, featuring the Devery Protocol is expected to be released in Q3. Their focus into 2019 and beyond will be expanding their partnerships and assisting with the development of verification applications tailored for specific markets.

bitcoinist	discovering-investment-opportunities	Discovering Investment Opportunities - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-27T10:30	Starting of initial coin offerings (ICOs) creates a lot of investor interest netting millions of dollars in a relatively short period. That’s a valid reason why new ICOs are rapidly launching one by one, and new tokens emerge every week. Choosing a project worth investing has become a challenging task that requires knowledge and patience. With this in mind, any potential investor should carefully review ICO offerings they would like to participate. An ICO investment can provide you with outrageous gains, but losses can be monumental as well. Any investment decision depends on a comprehensive appraisal of its present and future potential. Place Your Bet Wisely Sports betting occupies the largest market share in the global gambling market and income of bookmakers in 2017 has averaged out to more than 120 billion euro. According to H2 Gambling Capital, the income from online betting is expected to grow by nearly 12% annually, which sounds like a quite promising field to invest even if you have never placed a bet in your life. There were quite many attempts to create the newest blockchain-based PokerStars website, but it seems that this sub-niche in the gambling industry stays untouched. Competition among smaller projects is too big and future participants need the favorable and secure environment to secure their investments and ensure gambling income. However, there always someone, who should be the first. XWIN – the Most Reliable Cryptobetting Option Recently the broad audience was introduced to the XWIN project – a fully transparent revenue sharing Ethereum blockchain-based betting platform for sporting and other contests. XWIN’s mission is to deliver the most convenient and successful service in the crypto betting industry. XWIN have collected a sufficient amount of money during their pre-ICO, enrolled over 9600 people and engaged over 600 people in their referral program. Not bad. In addition to that, XWIN has got some attractive advantages. Blockchain and decentralization have already proved their advantages in IT and business sectors. Now online gambling can also profit from it by providing better conditions for all XWIN participants. XWIN smart contract is designed to meet all private investors’ needs and expectations. The XWIN token is based on ERC20 protocol and generates guaranteed income from XWIN activities through the distribution of 100% of the profit between token holders. The unique feature of XWIN is a possibility for investors to receive 20 percent commission out of general platform’s profit margin. Add to that continuity of the process, stability only attributable to the Ethereum blockchain, complete control over investments, accessibility 24/7/365 from anywhere in the world and from any device – mobile or stationary, security and confidentiality of information The XWIN business model with margins distribution will attract players by increasing the balance on their accounts.

bitcoinist	dna-data-marketplace-on-the-blockchain	DNA Data Marketplace on the Blockchain	2018-01-23T06:30	Big data is big money, and corporations such as Google and Facebook have made billions out of your personal information. Medical and genetic data is worth even more, and companies may be profiting from it whenever you take a genetic test. The solution in giving people back control over their genetic and DNA data is the blockchain. According to reports, consumer genetic testing saw unprecedented public demand last year. Companies, such as AncestryDNA, carried out an estimated 10 million tests on individuals. While they charge for these tests, the real value is in the genetic and DNA data which can be sold on to third party medical companies. Genome Demand There is a growing demand for genome data and research which brings about a conflict between individuals, corporations, and medical facilities. A solution lies in a decentralized blockchain and crypto token that facilitates the encrypted exchange of medical and genetic data. It is a fledgling industry, attracting a number of startups eager to employ blockchain technology to innovate solutions. One platform, Encrypgen, allows users to upload and securely store genomic data for up to five family members. This data can then be shared with their doctor after permission has been granted. Sequencing providers on the private blockchain can be used, or customers can upload their DNA from third party providers. Users can get notifications when a third party is interested in purchasing some of their genomic data. The transaction will be facilitated with DNA crypto tokens and recorded on the public ledger. Crypto Genetics Other companies are entering this embryonic industry with platforms of their own. Zenome uses nodes on a network of private computers to achieve a distributed approach to genetic analysis. The data is fragmented and encrypted to prevent theft and can be uploaded for no charge initially. Secure storage and a free report about your health and origin is provided in return. Users can choose whether to sell any of their own data using the firm’s own crypto token, ZEN. Luna DNA has a slightly different approach, enabling users to upload their data for health research purposes in exchange for some Luna Coin. The depersonalized data can be bought by research academies and pharmaceutical companies. Specific genome testing will only be implemented with the user’s consent. It is not easy putting a dollar value on the human genome, so only time will tell if these innovative, blockchain approaches to genetic data trading will pay off for individuals. Would you sell your genetic data on the blockchain? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of PublicDomainPictures and Pixabay.
bitcoinist	dutch-pirate-party-welcoming-bitcoin	Dutch Pirate Party: The Powers That Be Aren't Too Welcoming of Bitcoin	2017-02-08T11:00	Bitcoinist spoke with the Dutch Pirate Party Leader Ancilla van de Leest on their recent attempt to pay the Election Council with Bitcoin, their appeal with younger voters, and why they believe everybody should be free to choose the currency they want to use. Dutch Pirate Party: ‘We Need a Viable Alternative to Fiat’ Bitcoinist: Why was the Netherlands Pirate Party founded? What issues does it focus on? Ancilla van de Leest (AVL): The Dutch Pirate Party is one of the 40 different National Pirate Parties worldwide. The first Pirate Party was founded in Sweden in 2006 as a reaction to the crackdown on young people sharing culture and information on the internet: The first raid on The Pirate Bay. Both Bitcoin and the Pirate Party are about taking control away from the middlemen and from concentrations of power. They were called Pirates by the copyright industry, and they took that name as a badge of honor. The Swedish Pirate Party quickly took two seats in the European Parliament. After this the movement spread to many countries and their platforms grew to include severely limiting patents and copyright, both online and offline civil rights, freedom of information and speech, and much more direct democracy. We’re also strong supporters of “evidence based policy.” That’s why we strongly oppose the war on drugs and the war on cash. Our slogan for this election is “your choice” because we believe life is better if you can make your own choices. One of the hot topics for us this election are economic reform, data security, freedom of the press, decentralization of power, and civil rights such as privacy in an increasingly digital world. Bitcoinist: Can you tell us about the upcoming election and what you are trying to achieve? AVL: The election is for the lower house of the national parliament and it is held on March 15. There are 150 seats in total and there is no threshold for entry. The far right anti-immigration party of Geert Wilders (friends with France’s National Front and Germanies AfD) is set to become the largest party but we always need coalitions to form a government. Most other parties say they won’t work with Wilders so they’ll need a 4 or 5 party coalition to get a majority without him. We’re aiming for three seats and we need about 65,000 votes per seat. We have no ambition to be in government (yet), just to keep the government in check, to ask the tough questions, and to bring internet awareness and IT expertise to parliament. Bitcoinist: Why did you attempt to pay the Electoral Council with Bitcoin? Where you simply trying to make a statement? Or is there another reason? AVL: We have used bitcoin to pay for other things directly in the past and are very outspoken about the opportunities that cryptocurrencies offer. We continue to welcome bitcoin donations and keep close relations with the popular local cryptocoin Gulden. Bitcoinist: How does the ethos of Bitcoin align with the Pirate Party? AVL: Both Bitcoin and the Pirate Party are about taking control away from the middlemen and from concentrations of power. Bitcoin may not have much of a beef with the copyright industry, but the idea is the same: bring control back as close as possible to the people themselves, and get rid of institutions that position themselves as gatekeepers to either extract a fee or to censor. We [attempted to pay in bitcoin] to make a statement in support of decentralized currencies. […] Seems the powers that be aren’t too welcoming of this new development! Bitcoinist: Can you explain why the payment in Bitcoin was rejected? How did you resolve this problem? AVL: We had a stash of bitcoin laying around awaiting an opportunity like this. We definitely took this opportunity to make a statement in support of decentralized currencies. Oddly enough, the government is not set up yet to accept payments in Bitcoin! We’re talking about a traditional government institution so we took the path of least resistance and paid in euro’s and then recouped those euro’s by selling bitcoins donated to us over the years. Seems the powers that be aren’t too welcoming of this new development! Bitcoinist: There are numerous Pirate Parties springing up all over Europe, most notably in Iceland whose presidential candidate nearly won the election. What do you think is the reason for this rising popularity? AVL: More and more people all over Europe are fed up with the way their governments function (or don’t!). Many feel ignored and powerless. Some of those people turn away from politics altogether and stop showing up for elections. Others end up in the arms of far right parties because they play into their fears. In Iceland, the Pirates were on the barricades with the people during the pots and pans revolution and they spoke to the hopes and dreams of a better democracy. We’ve also begun accepting Gulden a while ago and we’re looking into Monero because of our stance on the importance of privacy. Of course, the Panama Papers helped matters a bit, after people were already very skeptical of centralized power because of the harsh Economic crash in 2008, which hit Iceland more than most other countries. Icelandic people have come to realize how important it is to have a transparent and accountable system that works for the people, not despite the people. Bitcoinist: Does you party accept Bitcoin donations like Germany’s or Finland’s, for example? Does the Netherlands law support these kinds of donations? AVL: Yes we’ve accepted donations in bitcoin for years. In fact, four years ago I donated a full bitcoin myself (15 euro back then). We’ve also begun accepting Gulden a while ago and we’re looking into Monero because of our stance on the importance of privacy. According to the law we cannot accept anonymous donations over 1,500 euro but it says nothing about the form of those donations. So donating 1 oz. gold coins would be perfectly fine; in fact, we would welcome those donations! Bitcoinist: The EU has a tax-free VAT policy on Bitcoin. Would this enable you to acquire more funds by accepting Bitcoin? AVL: You don’t pay tax on buying or selling bitcoin, but you still pay VAT if you pay for a product using bitcoin. We actually prefer bitcoin donations, but they are not worth any more or less than euros. The recent rise in price has been very good for us, but as any bitcoin fan knows: that fortune can easily reverse. We don’t speculate with our bitcoins, we use them when needed, regardless of the price at that particular moment. We think our bitcoin donors would prefer it that way! Bitcoinist: Who and where are your party’s biggest supporters? AVL: In cities with a younger and more progressive demographic we are currently doing really well. Amsterdam, Groningen and Delft are our hotbeds. We also find a lot of support in places with a lot of innovative hubs such as technical universities, start-ups and hackerspaces. Bitcoinist: The Dutch city of Arnhem has the densest population of Bitcoin merchants in the Netherlands, if not the world. What are your thoughts on this project? AVL: It shows they are really ahead of the curve and are eager to make use of the opportunities that technical innovation has to offer. Not surprisingly, they have a lot of technical school programs there, and Europe’s biggest hackerspace Beehive 4.2 will be opening its doors in the old Arnhem panopticon prison. Its encouraging in the sense that it demonstrates that it actually works over a longer period of time. It’s definitely superior [to the Euro] due to its decentralized nature. It’s impossible to endlessly print more [Bitcoin] and that is a great advantage over out current financial system. There is something special about Arnhem though, a lot of young people come up with concepts that work very well, from bitcoin city to Dance Festivals, to nice small shops and bar/restaurant concepts. All that entrepreneurial energy must also have helped bitcoin acceptance in Arnhem. Bitcoinist: Are you concerned over the looming Bitcoin regulations in the EU? Would your party support a hands-free approach when it comes to regulating Bitcoin? AVL: We would prefer the EU recognize bitcoin as a (foreign) currency. Next best thing would be a moratorium on regulations to give the currency and the network time to prove its usefulness. Bitcoin has so many more uses than just currency, let alone other blockchain based innovations such as Ethereum. Bitcoinist: Do you feel that Bitcoin can be a superior currency to the Euro? Could it replace it one day or can multiple currencies coexist? AVL: Yes definitely superior due to its decentralized nature. Also, it’s impossible to endlessly print more of them and that is a great advantage over out current financial system. At the same time we are very much in favor of some sort of tangible and untraceable currency. The war on cash is a big reason why we need a viable alternative to fiat. You can do things with a fiat currency that you can’t with bitcoin. Some will argue that some of those things are exactly the reason why bitcoin was invented :) The Pirate Party wants to enable everybody to choose the currency they want to use for their transactions. Bitcoinist: Anything else you’d like to add? AVL: Vote decentralized! Vote Pirate Party! Donate bitcoin! 1K5Q6WEFjRCaFJDxNibaXyQ9EXJTptt2fr Would the Dutch Pirate Party get your vote?

bitcoinist	easily-convert-digital-currencies-fiat-paycent	Easily Convert Digital Currencies to Fiat with Paycent - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-12T11:00	Paycent is mobile payment platform that functions as a dual e-wallet that can be funded by both digital currencies and fiat currency. It also allows conversion from digital to fiat and vice-versa, in real time and from within the wallet. Digital Currency to Fiat with Paycent One of the major problems that many digital currency users face is the challenge of converting digital currencies to fiat money. Currently, only a few retailers are accepting digital currencies as a payment method. Users are forced to sell their digital currencies for fiat through exchanges, which often have very high fees and can take 2 to 3 days before the money is deposited on the user’s bank account. Paycent is aiming to tackle this problem. Started by Singapore-based payments solution provider Texcent, the main idea behind the Paycent platform is to offer a service for both buyers and sellers to accept mobile and cashless payments with the power of blockchain technology. Digital currency users can pay for goods and services with their favorite digital assets through a Paycent debit card worldwide with extremely low fees. Paycent has fully launched in Singapore and the Philippines and planning to further expand into Indonesia, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Malaysia, Nepal, Bangladesh, India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Paycent team is hoping to not only help digital currency users with their platform but to also help people around the world that do not have a bank account to be able to make payments with their smartphones in a cheap, fast and cashless way. Paycent Debit Card According to the Paycent website, the platform is planning to begin pre-registration for the Paycent debit card on January 15 and deliver the first 20,000 cards in late February. Users will be able to enjoy easy and fast conversion of digital currency to fiat for a very low fee. The proposed transaction fees would be just 1.5% in PYN tokens. Paycent has already partnered with 3 different card network providers in order to ensure liquidity for global transactions. Users will be able to register their new cards directly on the Paycent website and be able to directly use it in over 130 countries. Paycent ICO The Paycent ICO is split into 8 stages, with the first round, which was launched on November 2, 2017, having already reached its completion. To date, the ICO has had over 14,000 contributors from 80 different countries and has sold close to 80% of the total token supply What makes the Paycent ICO different is the fact that the team is working closely with government regulators and financial institutions. Singaporean regulators have already approved the official license for the Paycent platform. The team is currently hard at work completing their next major milestone, which is the hybrid wallet. The hybrid wallet will not only let users load their debit cards, but also quickly and seamlessly convert their digital currency to fiat currency without having to rely on a third-party exchange, and use it at the same time with the Paycent debit card. For more information about Paycent please visit the company’s website. You can also download the project whitepaper and learn more about their ongoing ICO. Do you think that Paycent will be able to offer a fast and efficient way for digital currency users to spend their coins? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Paycent
bitcoinist	ellcrys-is-a-breath-of-fresh-air-for-open-source-collaborators	Ellcrys is a Breath of Fresh Air for Open Source Collaborators - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-21T18:00	Ellcrys is an up and coming blockchain network that aims to revolutionize the way developers work together. In addition to trying to revitalize collaborative efforts, the company has an ICO that promises to make the mining and distribution of its native cryptocurrency fairer and more accessible. A Growing Problem Technology has infiltrated every part of our everyday lives leading to a surge of products and services and, along with it, the demand for people to develop these projects. Unfortunately, current web service providers limit organization accounts to only one admin or owner. This structure, present on services like Github, Stripe, and Heroku, gives a single person the power to add or remove people at will and manage the account resources. A framework such as this is incompatible with future decentralization, where there is no single owner, no leader, no trust, and no headquarters. Ellcrys, a recently announced blockchain network, hopes to solve the limitations that developers confront. The company plans to create an open, transparent, blockchain-backed environment for building software projects based on git and IPFS technologies. It aims to decentralize git hosting and provide a governance protocol that will allow multiple people to co-own and manage a software project. What’s wrong with Github? Nothing alarming, claims Ellcrys, but the company expressed concerns that hosting repositories on Github could lead to the censorship of projects in the future. Changing the Way People Collaborate To conceive the trustless, democratic collaboration that Ellcrys seeks to enable, they utilize Git. The popular version control system allows teams to collaborate on a software project. Using this technology, anyone in the world will be able to contribute to a project, and contributors will have the ability to fetch branches, push changes, and create pull request proposals to have their work merged. Ellcrys’ blockchain decentralizes a git repository by bundling and distributing git objects across the network. A structure such as this works to eliminate the hierarchal structure that is present in other services and will hopefully result in an environment that is trustless, democratic and free of censorship. The company believes the platform will greatly benefit open-source maintainers looking to earn revenue from paid branches, as well as open-source contributors interested in receiving compensation for completing tasks. Ellcrys has designed the network to reward contributors in a hope that it will spur creativity and innovation, saying: We think incentivizing people to contribute to open source would get more people interested in growing open source. The network will reward people with coins when their pull request is approved. Perhaps the most exciting element of Ellcrys’ network is the Polyglot App Hosting. Ellcrys will create transparency at the repository level by allowing collaborators to collectively contribute to a repository and create proposals that authorize any centralized polyglot hosting service of their choice. While not positioning itself as a smart contract platform, it plans to support smart contract. A git branch can contain functions that may be compiled and executed against transactions. Ellcrys smart contracts are repo-addressable, meaning that transactions are addressed to the repository they were loaded from as opposed to the contract address. This allows for versioned smart contracts that can be upgraded without breaking dependent services. With Ellcrys, users can create smart contracts using established languages like Javascript, Ruby, and Go. ICO and Pre-Sale Ellcrys hopes to make a splash with the release of their own native coin in 2018. The coin has been dubbed Ell (ELL), Ellies being the plural form, and has a supply of 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) coins. The coins will be distributed through a process called StackMint. StackMint allows users from around the world to exchange their national banknotes for ELL through a scanning and validation process, outlined in detail on their website. After scanning the currency and having it validated, users are still free to spend this tender but are unable to rescan it into the Ellcrys network. The purpose of StackMint is to ensure fair, inclusive distribution of the lifetime supply of the coin to everyone irrespective of access to specialized mining hardware. Ellcrys is holding their pre-sale for the coins from February 1st until March 1st, and their ICO opens up between March 30th and April 30th. Timeline As of right now, Ellcrys is still in its early stages but has high expectations for the coming years. In 2017, Ellcrys began their project to streamline the collaborative process and continued to tweak it throughout the year. This past year was devoted to putting Ellcrys on its feet by beginning research and development, in addition to releasing multiple whitepapers to hone the company’s vision. The company will hold two investment rounds for their coin between February and April of 2018. The company aims to run a test of their network by the end of 2018 and subsequently developing an alpha and beta version. Pushing into 2019 Ellcrys will make multiple upgrades to its network to improve its capabilities, such as StackMint and cloud services. The company has already made various connections and partnerships but will hopefully expand on those even more in the next few years. Ellcrys Team Kenny Idialu is CEO and Co-Founder of Ellcrys. He has experience as a software developer for multiple firms such as Delivery Science and Save & Buy, eventually leading him to create his own projects. Odion Olumhense is COO and Co-Founder of Ellcrys. She has co-founded various companies, including Gangfly, Jet Leasing Support Services, and Object Networks. Victor Asemota is an advisor to Ellcrys and currently works as a director at SwiftaCorp, an organization he co-founded. How do you think the Ellcrys platform will affect future software collaboration projects? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Ellcrys, AdobeStock

bitcoinist	eos-investors-shell-700m-purposeless-token	The White Elephant in the Room - EOS Investors Shell Out $700m for Purposeless Token - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-18T23:00	One of the main snippets of advice given to inexperienced crypto traders is to try and look for altcoins that have a purpose or technology that can be applied in real-world situations. Many of them do just that including Ethereum, NEO, Substratum, OmiseGO, Power Ledger, Factom, Iota and TenX to name a few. Then there are those that are just currencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin which can also be outstanding investment opportunities as we have seen in recent months. What is a mystery is the amount of investment that has gone into cryptos that do not really offer anything aside from a blockchain. According to an article on Wall Street Journal investors have already spent $700 million on a tech startup offering a digital token which they themselves state has no purpose. FOMO Flashes The company, Block.one, raised the funds during the ICO which has come at a time of mass crypto mania and big doses of FOMO (fear of missing out). The report went on to claim that the Cayman Islands-registered company develops software via an open source website; it has created a blockchain platform that does not really offer anything beyond the thousands that already exist in the crypto sphere. The website offers a pretty standard ‘we are a scalable decentralized app platform’ statement with a basic white paper and a few team photos. They have been auctioning 2 million tokens every day to raise funds for the ICO. The EOS core code is posted publically and the company released a new version of it last week causing a now commonly seen spike in price that usually follows altcoin news. Toothless Token Once the platform is released the EOS tokens that have no real relationship to it will serve no purpose. Block.one only intends to write the base code and let third-party developers do the rest. The WSJ states that a purchase agreement which investors must sign states the tokens “do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features.” In this way, the token seems like the proverbial “white elephant” – expensive to own but serving no purpose. The current buying frenzy just shows that people are still willing to invest in concepts that are being built for a technological market that doesn’t exist yet. With a market capacity of $5.1 billion EOS is one of the top altcoins of the moment, sitting at 14 th place in the crypto cap charts. It has jumped over 450% this month from $1.97 to an all-time high today of $11.11, market corrections have seen the price fall back a little but it is clearly evident that traders are still going crypto nuts. Is EOS just another useless “white elephant” of a token or will it eventually have some purpose? Would you invest in EOS? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	eos-tops-8-end-ethereums-reign	As EOS Tops $8 Is the Sun About to Set on Ethereum's Reign? - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-30T17:00	EOS hype is off the chart, but does the company have the capacity to outperform Ethereum? We answer that question and several more as we do a deep dive into the company, its management, and its business model. It’s easy to proclaim the latest technology the next internet, [insert crypto] killer, or even the next generation blockchain. But will it hold up to the hype? That is the question EOS is about to answer. To understand EOS, think of it as an IBM PC running Linux to Ethereum’s Commodore 64. The former being faster, more scalable and able to accommodate a wider variety of applications. That’s not a knock on Ethereum as the Commodore 64 has outsold every computer in history, but it does speak to the Ethereum’s current capabilities. If you ask EOS founder Dan Larimer, the biggest obstacle to widespread Ethereum adoption is the speed and scalability of the platform. But can’t Ethereum solve those issues and snuff out EOS in the long term? Larimer believes there is room for both, and several others as well. But the reality is – the war is on. It’s being fought in the crypto community, with crypto platform developers, and in the media. To some it’s personal. Several people have come out publicly to accuse Larimer of developing a series of Ponzi schemes and that EOS is just the latest. Larrimer is no stranger to blockchain technologies, he’s built two and understands their limitations. Which is why he built EOS. Dismissing someone who has built two blockchains because some feel they aren’t legitimate isn’t a sound argument. But even if EOS is superior and developers adopt it – it doesn’t mean it will win. EOS will need a ‘ Crypto Kitty ‘ moment to truly test and legitimize the platform as a potential Ethereum competitor. Why EOS Could Unseat Ethereum On paper, EOS promises to perform better and will incorporate the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus protocol which is basically a democratized voting system except those with the most tokens have the most votes. The system is decentralized, exceedingly fast and uses far less energy. EOS claims it will be able to process millions of transactions per second compared to Ethereum’s 15 and Visa’s 45,000 per second. Even better, EOS promises there will be no user fees on its blockchain – another key differentiator that could help them gain wider adoption than Ethereum’s toll model. Scalable blockchain that is free (like the internet that doesn’t charge for usage) will win the day. The real test of EOS is its decentralized operating system. Will the promise that developers can build applications on EOS with EOS coins as a claim on its server resources versus a toll model be realized? Apparently, a developer need only possess and not spend EOS coins to use the EOS blockchain and server resources. Back to the IBM PC/Linux analogy, the EOS developers and community control the platform, the more vested you are, the more influence you have. The platform is free, resources and libraries are shared and theoretically, developers will churn out applications that are faster, cheaper and better than anything you can produce on Ethereum. So is EOS a Winner or Loser? Currently, EOS is trading at $8.69 and its market cap is $4.9 billion. This puts EOS.io at number 12 out of all cryptocurrency market capitalizations. The market believes it will be a winner, but it’s not yet convinced that it will supplant Ethereum as the preferred decentralized application platform. Currently, there are several developers testing the EOS Dawn 2.0 platform but I have yet to see any confirmed success stories. It’s still early, but this is a critical milestone that will give potential EOS coin holders additional confidence in the platform. True, Ethereum has a first mover’s advantage, but like fellow first movers MySpace, Atari, and Netscape, all had early success and led their markets until they were unseated by superior, generation 2 competitors. Moreover, EOS’ trajectory is closing in on Ethereum’s and is currently trading over $600 billion in volume a day. That’s not a micro-competitor. In regard to leadership, EOS’s Larimer has a track record of leaving the company before it’s time, but that track record also includes Steem and Bitshares whose market cap is higher than 98% of the rest of the traded coins. But from my research, I don’t have a clear picture of how the revenue model is going to succeed, so there are still some big question marks that need to be answered here. So, my short-term advice is that since EOS is still a speculative investment, invest like a venture capitalist. Take a reasonable position to start – enough to keep you interested in following the company, then increase the investment in a series of rounds once milestones are reached. In the long-term, it’s important to understand EOS’s intrinsic value (unknown) versus their market value ($4.7 billion) because eventually, they will meet. At this stage, I am willing to bet the difference is vast and thus EOS is not something you want to hodl. Here is my EOS scorecard: Management B+ Market Size A+ Go to market Strategy A Product validation None Scalable A Business model C Differentiated product B Quick summary: invest a small amount in the short term, then increase or decrease your investment as key milestones are reached.* *For informational use only. Not intended to be investment advice. Do you disagree with my analysis? Is EOS a stronger or weaker buy in the short term than I’ve indicated? Images courtesy of EOS.io, YouTube, Steemit
bitcoinist	escalating-ether-breaks-new-records	Escalating Ethereum Breaks New Records - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-12T01:15	As we roll into another week of crypto trading the Bitcoin bulls have been a little subdued in the last 24 hours. BTC hasn’t fluctuated much from around $16,400 where it currently trades. Huge swings in the king of crypto were bounteous this weekend amid the launch of CBOE’s futures contracts. Bitcoin gained and lost over $5,000 in just a few days before recovering but Ethereum has remained pretty flat for weeks … until now. The Asian trading session this morning has been lively, to say the least, especially for Litecoin and Ethereum, both reaching record highs. For the past three weeks, Ethereum been stuck in second gear, sitting in a sideways channel trading around $460 with only marginal gains. At around 23.00 UTC things started to reverberate for the crypto asset as it broke through resistance levels and headed upwards up and over the psychological $500 level. According to CoinMarketCap, the skyward surge continued and ETH reached an all-time high of $553 four hours later. This represents a jump of around 17% in just a few hours. A slight correction pulled prices back down to around $530 but it has since regained momentum. Market Cap Surge Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This alone jumped from $46 billion yesterday to around $51 billion today. CoinMarketCap’s data indicated that Coinbase owned GDAX was responsible for the most transactions, $287 million – around 11% of the total – in the past 24 hours. The second most popular exchange for Ethereum was Bitfinex with 9.5% of the trade, followed by South Korea’s Bithumb running 7.5% of the transactions. The total amount of Ethereum shifted over the past 24 hours was $2.6 billion at the time of writing. The last time ETH broke $500 was very briefly during the CryptoKitties craze that swept the internet at the end of November. The network became bogged down by digital cats and transactions ground to a halt. Prices dropped back to around $450 where they have remained up until yesterday. Big Banks Back Blockchain The latest surge has likely come off the back of news that the global banking industry is showing an interest in Ethereum based smart contracts. News reports revealed that Barclays, Credit Suisse, KBC, SIX, Thomson Reuters, and UBS are seeking to automate Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements with the assistance from smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By doing so enables large financial institutions to meet more stringent regulations and directives on a common platform. At the time of writing Ethereum was trading at around $535, 16% higher than the same time last month. Where is the top for Ethereum, can it go even higher this year?

bitcoinist	estonia-one-step-closer-creating-digital-nation	Estonia Is One Step Closer to Creating a Digital Nation - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-30T02:00	Estonia is well on its way to realizing its dream of building a global nation supported by its e-Residency program and its own cryptocurrency. Digital currencies have definitely taken 2017 by storm. Massive price increases, mainstream adoption and just an overall interest in the benefits of blockchain technology have been some of the key highlights of this year. It’s not just investors hoping to capitalize on these benefits though, governments can also see the advantages to having a cashless financial system. Bragging Rights for the First State-Run ICO Estonia had previously announced its plan to develop its own cryptocurrency, the Estcoin. In addition, the country has plans to launch an ICO for its crypto. If successful, it will be the world’s first state-approved and supported ICO. According to Futurism, the Estcoin would support the country’s e-Residency initiative, which is a project aimed at creating and fostering a global digital nation. Kaspar Korjus, who is the program’s managing director, explained that essentially, anyone in the world who has Internet access can become a “digital citizen” of Estonia. In addition, these citizens can set up and run their business in the country. Since its launch, the e-Residency initiative has received over 27,000 applicants from more than 140 countries. In addition, 4,272 companies have been registered. A Multi-Faceted Token According to Korjus, the state-operated Estcoin token would have varied uses. He explained: The community Estcoin would be structured to support the objective of growing our new digital nation by incentivizing more people around the world to apply for and make greater use of e-Residency. This includes encouraging investors and entrepreneurs to use e-Residency as their platform for trusted ICO activity. These tokens, which cannot be traded, can also be used to facilitate electronic signatures, and for log-in purposes. Even though its value will be connected to that of the euro, it is by no means a substitute for the country’s fiat currency. Vitalik Buterin, who is the co-founder of Ethereum, gave his opinion on the matter: [I]f these estcoins are issued on top of a blockchain (they could possibly be issued in multiple formats at the same time, nothing wrong with this) then it would become easy and convenient to use them inside of smart contracts and other applications. Estcoin Is Part of the Bigger Picture Even though countries such as Russia, Israel, and Dubai have plans to launch their own state-controlled digital currencies, Estonia seems to have a clear picture in mind, not just in creating a useful crypto, but incorporating it into a new era in the digital revolution. Do you think Estonia will succeed in creating a digital nation? Will the Estcoin help with this vision? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, e-resident.gov.ee
bitcoinist	ether-rising-30-week	Ether Rising, up 30% in a Week	2018-01-29T12:45	January has been a pretty slow month for all cryptocurrencies. The majority of them have not made a recovery from the big slump two weeks ago. Bitcoin, as usual, has commanded the big selloff, but Ethereum has remained relatively resilient to downward pressures and has posted solid gains over the past couple of days. Ethereum has now garnered the attention of mainstream media, such as Forbes, which recently reported about its upward momentum. A major market correction was expected, and it has been surmised that such corrections are a naturally occurring thing for cryptocurrencies at this time of year. Ether Rising According to Livecoinwatch.com, which includes South Korean markets, Ethereum is up over $1,200 from a low of $930 this time last Monday. This represents a weekly rise of 30%. The same cannot be said of Bitcoin, which has conversely shown very little gain from its price this time last week. The 24 hour trade volume for ETH has been around $4.5 billion, with South Korea’s Bithumb being the top exchange with over 10% of that trade in Korean won. According to NewsBTC editor Joseph Young, who was also quoted by Forbes, the rise is in line with an increase in transactions on the network: The increase in the daily transaction volume of the Ethereum network reflects the exponential growth rate of decentralized applications launched on top of the Ethereum protocol. Applications like EtherDelta, 0x, Radar Relay, and CryptoCribs have gained a significant amount of active users over the past few months. This week, $1.6 billion cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong praised CryptoCribs, a decentralized Ethereum-based Airbnb-like platform with a non-ICO model. Greater Demand As the number of ICOs and decentralized applications grows, the demand for Ethereum will follow. It is the platform of choice at the moment due to its level of support and a number of scalability improvements in the pipeline for the network. The Ethereum roadmap addresses these scalability challenges through the implementation of its Casper update, which has already in the testing phase. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said: The Casper aspect of Casper, where two conflicting blocks should not be able to be finalized, seems to actually happen running and the network agrees all along what the final chain is. So that part has been totally successful. On the Sharding side, quite a lot of work has started. Sharding involves taking a lot of the work off the chain to increase transaction speeds and lessen the load on the distributed ledger. Ethereum is set to grow from strength to strength, and this is currently being reflected in its increasing price. [Disclaimer: the author of this article is a holder of Ethereum (ETH)] For how far will Ethereum go, can we expect $2,000 soon? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

bitcoinist	etherbanking-changing-your-mind-on-banking	Etherbanking - Changing Your Mind on Banking - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-11T21:30	Etherbanking launched in August 2017 as the world’s first automated banking application with E-Smartcontract technology with an aim to “change your mind on banking.” Etherbanking has already emerged as a successful cryptocurrency lender, with the team garnering over 100,000 members in their first 3 months of operation. Their ICO launches on the 10 th of January 2018, where they shall be issuing 5 million EBC tokens, each with a starting price of $10. Etherbanking’s Vision Etherbanking envisions a bank with no branches, staff, or offices. Think of the way Uber works as a company without owning any cabs, or Airbnb without owning property. Etherbanking is keen to create a financially efficient system that benefits from the Ethereum blockchain, eliminating unnecessary costs that exist in traditional finance. One of the unique features of the blockchain is that it removes the need for expensive third parties or pre-existing infrastructure that must be relied upon. Third parties also present a security risk, making blockchain transactions and confirmations far more secure. Etherbanking is looking to create a decentralized network of users to support and profit from the Etherbanking ecosystem. Etherbanking allows anyone to become a miner and earn rewards from using a stake-based Proof of Stake (POS). The Etherbanking Ecosystem Etherbanking exists in an ecosystem composed of 5 specific components: the E-banking system itself, the Etherbanking App, the EBC Exchange Platform, The EBC-pay payment gateway, and the E-Smartcontracts. E-banking offers a safe loan club for users, group savings, community mobilization aimed at allowing users to transfer capital with the community alongside smart contracts that help define the requirements of a transaction on behalf of both participants. Open fund certificates will be offered, allowing users to invest, with liquidity. Smart Insurance policies aim to revolutionize the insurance industry, allowing well-defined policies that result in instant payment to customers upon the conditions of insurance being met. The Etherbanking App is set to be a multi-currency, all in one bank that will allow a user to easily swap between currencies as required. The EBC-Exchange will be a multi-currency global trading platform using EBC as the currency that drives all transactions. The platform aims to provide an EBC token doorway to a multitude of currencies, in much the same way that Bitcoin is currently used as a predominant trading pair to other cryptocurrencies. E-Smartcontracts. Etherbanking recognizes that smart contracts present barriers to users, especially in regard to how they may be specifically be programmed, therefore Etherbanking have developed their own propriety software allowing smart contracts to be completed with an array of pre-existing template options. To make this system secure Etherbanking will be using 2FA security and biometrics such as fingerprint, retina and facial recognition technology. EBC-pay is the part of the Etherbanking ecosystem that acts as a secure, payment gateway. Transactions will cost 1% per EBC, just a third of the price of credit card payments. Etherbanking is already promoting this method of payment with leading e-commerce channels, and as a member of the system, you will have access to this payment method. The ICO On January 10, 2018, Etherbanking begins its ICO, issuing 5 million EBC tokens from a total of 33 million.

bitcoinist	ethereum-classic-tech-update-sees-30-new-year-price-spike	Ethereum Classic Tech Update Sees 30% New Year Price Spike	2018-01-01T11:00	South Korea’s biggest exchange Bithumb has led a trading spike in Ethereum Classic (ETC) which saw the altcoin gain 29% in 24 hours Monday. Korean Market Leads 40% Of ETC Charge Handling over 40% of ETC’s 727 million daily volume, Bithumb support fuelled a price reversal towards recent all-time highs above $40. Following a general cryptocurrency market decline last week, ETC had fallen rapidly to below $27 according to cross-exchange data from Coinmarketcap. Unlike many, however, the Ethereum fork has staged an equally swift comeback, second only to Stellar as new announcements emerged about its Emerald development project. A blog post published January 31 outlined full details of Emerald’s three-tier features suite to further ETC use cases, including Dapp development opportunities and an in-house consumer wallet. Drawing conspicuous attention to Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Gavin Wood’s embattled wallet project, the post reads: This helps ETC lay down a solid foundation free from weaknesses that can be exploited, such as the first and second Parity vulnerabilities, and large token losses with ERC20 Token Standard vulnerabilities. The update appeared to have a significant effect on sensitive ETC markets, with a jump from $27 to $36 occurring within hours as traders reacted. It’s Not All ‘Shillbert’ Historically, the ETC ecosystem had largely depended on publicity activity from major proponent Barry Silbert, whose comparative withdrawal from public advocacy earlier this year came in tandem with several months of flat growth. A brief return saw Silbert plug the altcoin on mainstream media TV at the height of Bitcoin’s price peak, a move which has since been criticized as being apt to attract needless attention from regulators. The Digital Currency Group CEO’s Twitter posts on ETC specifically could create problems associated with price manipulation, two attorneys told Reuters last week. Silbert had stressed to the publication that he was “highly, highly sensitive” to requirements laid down by securities authorities to keep tokens above board.

bitcoinist	ethereum-flows-four-figures	Ethereum Flows into Four Figures - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-05T10:15	The start of 2018 has been a bumper one for cryptocurrency with the total market capacity jumping $150 billion in just five days. Bitcoin has remained relatively flat, so it has been the job of the altcoins to boost the total investment, and Ethereum has been leading the way. For the first time a few hours ago, Ethereum reached a thousand dollars during the morning trading session in Asia. Cryptocurrencies have grown so much that mainstream media such as Forbes are now reporting on the rise of Ethereum. Ether Rising According to Coinmarketcap, Ether rose to a record high of $1,045 before falling back a little. The jump represents an overall increase of 38% for the week and 130% over the last month. ETH had a huge year in 2017, rising from around $10 in January to over $750 at the end of December, a monumental 7400% compared to Bitcoin’s 1600% rise. Ether is used as a payment system for decentralized applications; it is one of the most established cryptocurrencies and, consequently, a top choice for new investors. Senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro, Mati Greenspan, sung its praises: Ethereum is currently the most established cryptocurrency in the market and many believe that it is the future of the internet. Money continues to flow into blockchain networks and Ethereum is simply the strongest one. Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, maintains that there is a feeling that Ethereum is still relatively undervalued despite its recent price increases. ICO Momentum The number of ICOs using the Ethereum platform has been increasing, which has directly influenced the price of the world’s number three digital asset. ETH has only recently lost out on the second spot to Ripple. With Bitcoin transactions slowing in speed and increasing in cost, many traders are switching to Ethereum to participate in ICOs and buy smaller altcoins. Chris Keshian, co-founder of the Apex Token Fund, said that there are a large number of ERC20 ICOs launching on Ethereum this month. Investors are buying Ether to participate in these new ICOs or to accumulate gains fueled by the anticipation. CEO of 360 Blockchain USA, Jeff Koyen, added: News of mainstream adoption is certainly driving the rally to some degree, but I think it’s also a reaction to the Bitcoin skeptics who have been especially vocal this week. This year, we’ll see less wholesale condemnation of crypto, and more specialized sniping at certain coins — Bitcoin being the most obvious target. Only the most stubborn dinosaurs and luddites will cling to their position that crypto is a passing fad. Ethereum is traded on all major exchanges with Binance leading the way, carrying over 20% of the total. Trade volume over the past 24 hours has been just under $7 billion, and Ethereum’s total market capacity at the time of writing has just surpassed $100 billion. [Disclosure: the author of this article is a holder of Ethereum] How far will Ether climb? Can we expect $2,000 this year? Add your comments below. Images courtesy of Pxhere and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	ethereum-price-brakes-500-barrier-for-the-first-time	Ethereum Price Breaks $500 Barrier for the First Time - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-29T18:00	As the whole finance and tech world is currently focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum has managed to hit a new all-time high price as well. The Rise of Ethereum Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency that is currently in the news spotlight. The digital currency Ethereum has also gained a lot of momentum over the last couple of months. Analysts and experts believe that the reason for the astronomical rise of Ethereum is the recent hype around Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs. According to the cryptocurrency statistics website Coinschedule, over $3.6 billion USD were invested into ICO projects this year alone. The vast majority of these token sales are creating ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network, and since investors need Ethereum in order to invest in the token sales the demand for the digital currency has exploded. The ICO craze pushed the Ethereum price over 5,000% this year and earlier today it managed to surpass the astonishing price of $500. Ethereum May Reach $1500 Many cryptocurrency traders and investors are wondering now if this might be the end of the Ethereum bull run while others are convinced that this is just the beginning. Famous serial investor and former hedge fund manager, Mike Novogratz, stated in a recent CNBC article that the Ethereum price might even triple from its current price. Novogratz further stated: There’s a big wave of money coming, not just here but all around the world, The current cryptocurrency market valuation is over $316 billion – greater than that of Disney, Nike, and Electronic Arts combined. Bitcoin and Ethereum were not the only winners in the cryptocurrency market today. Litecoin is up 9% today and has managed to reach the price of $100 for the first time ever. IOTA is also up around 15% today and recently managed to break another all-time high price of $1.51 in the last couple of days. Last but not least, the anonymous cryptocurrency DASH, is up by 21% today and also managed to break an all-time high price of $753. Many experts believe that this is just the start for the digital currency market, as more and more institutional money will soon pour into the market. What are your thoughts on the recent Ethereum price hike? Do you think that Novogratz’s prediction will come true and Ethereum goes 3 times as high as it currently is?

bitcoinist	ethereum-regains-second-spot-ripple-plunges	Ethereum Regains Second Spot, Ripple Plunges - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-09T02:30	The race for supremacy in crypto land changes daily and it is hard to keep up with the high paced markets. Bitcoin is still king as most altcoins can only be traded with it, but the top four below it are duking it out for second, third, and fourth place by market capacity. With three out of the top four exchanges closing their doors to new registrations a couple of days ago it has been a little trickier to measure market sentiment. Transactions were also suspended temporarily at some of them including the world’s busiest exchange, Binance, which put the brakes on Ethereum transactions for a while. Trading Places Ethereum has been making solid gains for the past week rising from $870 to a high of $1,260 over the past seven days. Although markets have corrected somewhat, ETH is still trading high at $1,180, representing an increase of just over 35% for the week. The steady uptrend increased Ethereum’s market capacity to $114 billion at the time of writing according to Coinmarketcap. This was enough to push it back into the second spot in the market cap charts, eclipsing Ripple, which has dropped into third. According to reports a fall in Bitcoin prices has boosted all of the altcoins, especially the top ones. Ethereum can also be used to trade for other altcoins now which means investors are slowing moving into ETH trades as the network is faster and transactions are cheaper than Bitcoin. For those asking us about the recent price fluctuation, @coinmarketcap has excluded Korean exchanges from their pricing averages. This change applies to all of their listed digital assets, not just $XRP. https://t.co/sMfKucxvXU — Ripple (@Ripple) January 8, 2018 Ripple Roiled After an impressive surge up the charts in recent weeks, Ripple’s XRP token has taken a turn from its all-time high of $3.80 on January 4 down to its current price of $2.47. Ripple has been boosted by trade in Asia following announcements of a couple of partnerships with major banks in the region. It was further boosted by rumors that Coinbase would list it this year but these have since been refuted, contributing to the recent slide. Ripple has declined 35% over the past five days and has shed almost $50 billion from its total market capacity. XRP may have fallen out of favor with crypto aficionados due to its ties with the company that owns it and the fact that a few head honchos there own huge quantities of the digital asset, including the CEO, who reportedly has a 5 billion XRP stash. Additionally, there has been mass confusion on the markets in the past 24 hours as analytics website Coinmarketcap, which is used for most price references, decided to exclude exchanges in South Korea where XRP is heavily traded. Is Ethereum destined to be the king of crypto? Add your comments below. Images courtesy of AdobeStock, PxHere

During the crowd sale, which will last until February 21st, utilities-tokens ET4 will be on sale. ET4 tokens will allow their owners to get a number of advantages when buying or selling tickets through the ETicket4 platform. Thus, with the ET4 token, customers will be able to receive discounts up to 100% of the ticket price, and sellers will have access to the extended functionality of the analytical cabinet. So, when, for example, tickets for the football World Cup are paid with tokens, the buyer receives a 20% cashback, while paying for tickets to any other events – 10%. To join ETicket4 and to participate in its Pre ICO, users may send BTC (Bitcoin) or ETH (Ethereum) and receive ET4 tokens in return at a price of 1/1000 ETH per token. Those who buy tokens in the first five days of Pre ICO will receive a discount of 8%. Also, bonuses are provided depending on the volume of investments and can reach 30% discount. ETicket4 is an international secondary ticketing platform developed by Russian-Israeli entrepreneurs in 2015. Being an intermediary between various entities involved in the ticket reselling process, the platform serves as a guarantor of transaction security, tickets’ validity, timely payment, and delivery. ETicket4 has an annual turnover of $2 million and already provides tokens with real, rather than speculative, liquidity. During the FIFA Confederations Cup ticket selling period, ETicket4 successfully entered the CIS countries and Eastern Europe markets having sold more than 80,000 tickets for the Cup matches and major performers’ shows. ETicket4 already provides high speed and transparency of transactions in the secondary ticket market.

The service is not only an intermediary but also a guarantor of transaction security, authenticity tickets, timely payment, and delivery. In the long term, the company plans to scale its business in Europe and the US. Right now the project team is already working on a loyalty program at the core of the token economy, forecasting prices in the secondary market with the help of the neural network, forward contracts for brokers, and general expansion of the platform functionality with the help of blockchain technologies. The participants of the platform have the opportunity to forecast changes in ticket prices and choose the most favorable time for the transaction. Forward contracts and analytical tools for brokers reduce the risks of not selling tickets purchased, and our experience in conducting safe transactions will allow users not to be afraid of fraud.

bitcoinist	etoro-bitcoin-ethereum-volume	EToro Sees Bitcoin & Ethereum Trading Volume ‘Explode’ by 4,500% - Bitcoinist.com	2017-04-28T05:30	eToro has revealed that the number of users its Bitcoin and Ethereum has soared while trading volumes have “exploded” on its platform since the beginning of the year. eToro Runs Up Trading Volume 4,500% EToro, a leading online trading and investment platform, has experienced a huge increase in both cryptocurrency users and trading volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to Marketwatch. So far this year, eToro users trading CFDs (contracts for difference) in cryptocurrencies his risen by four times compared to the same period in 2016. Since the beginning of the year, cryptocurrency trading volume on eToro has soared by a whopping 4,500%. Since Bitcoin trading has been supported by eToro since 2014, one major reason for this surge can be attributed to the platform’s addition of Etheurem in the beginning of the year. The price of Ethereum has jumped from about $15 USD per Ether (ETH) to over $65 today in just the past two months. This is reflected in 90% of Ethereum traders buying the asset since it was launched on eToro. Meanwhile, 80% of Bitcoin traders have been buying up the cryptocurrency for a consecutive fifteen months, eToro notes. It should also be noted that eToro provides a feature called “copy functionality.” This lets novice users copy the trading strategies of its most successful cryptocurrency traders. ‘Cryptocurrency is the Future of Forex’ Commenting on this impressive growth, Senior Markets Analyst at eToro, Mati Greenspan, believes that “ Cryptocurrency is the future of forex.” [O]ver the last 12 months we’ve seen a 4x growth in traders accessing this market. But the volume of trading has exploded even more than this, with a huge 4,500% jump. As the total cryptocurrency market capitalization recently passed $30 billion, Greenspan explained, that its users have been reaping ‘significant rewards’ from this jump in prices and a nascent market that has doubled in just the past four months. “The rapid growth in the adoption and price of cryptocurrencies only marks the first few steps on the long-journey to establishing cryptocurrencies as a dominant force in forex trading,” he continued. We expect cryptocurrency trading volumes to get much bigger over the coming years. As Bitcoin is once again above Gold market price, surging to record highs, the cryptocurrency market should continue to attract even more traditional investors looking for the next big thing. Recent news of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) willing to review its rejection of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF is just the latest in a string of positive news for traders to be bullish on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole. Will the cryptocurrencies market continue to attract traditional investors or will we see another repeat of the dot-com bubble? Share your thoughts below!

bitcoinist	eurozone-wont-introduce-a-fiat-based-cryptocurrency-anytime-soon	Eurozone Won't Introduce a Fiat-Based Cryptocurrency Anytime Soon - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-23T23:00	Cryptocurrencies are steadily gaining support and popularity and, as a result, many experts believe that governments will launch fiat-based digital currencies. Governments Are Embracing Cryptocurrencies In this year many governments and regulators have taken measures regarding cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and ICOs. 2017 has been a very interesting and exciting year for the whole cryptocurrency space. The Japanese government officially recognized and legalized Bitcoin as a payment method, and this decision surprised many cryptocurrency users. Later in the year, Chinese regulators suspended several cryptocurrency sites and exchanges amid plans to introduce official regulations. This caused a massive exodus of Chinese cryptocurrency traders, and many decided to use exchanges based in Japan and South Korea in order to bypass this ban. Recent news emerged that the government of Belarus officially legalized cryptocurrencies and gave them tax-exempt status for the next 5 years. Belarus is aiming to attract more fintech and cryptocurrency startups/companies into opening operations in its country and thus become an international cryptocurrency hub. Is It Time for a Fiat-Based Digital Currency? Many analysts have speculated that governments and financial institutions will launch their own fiat-based cryptocurrencies in order to compete with decentralized ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many central banks have already started testing their own digital currencies. The most famous example is the prototype digital currency that the People’s Bank of China has been quietly testing. A report by TechCrunch stated that the Russian government is also exploring the possibility of creating its own state-issued cryptocurrency called CryptoRuble. Many governments around the world are currently experimenting with digital currencies and their possibilities. The DailyMail reported that the Eurozone, however, has no plans to introduce its own fiat-based digital currency. Specifically, Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele does not see a possibility for the Eurozone to introduce its own cryptocurrency in the near future. He further stated: Digital central bank money analogous to cash is currently not in sight. He also added: We are seeing a rapid increase in value, which brings the risk of rapid losses, The main reason behind this is the fact that fiat-based cryptocurrencies might bring unpredictable issues like scaling, security, and costs. Besides, many experts believe that the astronomical rise of Bitcoin may concern central banks from adopting their own digital currencies. What are your thoughts on a Eurozone-based digital currency? Do you think that a government-issued cryptocurrency might benefit consumers and banks? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay, ShutterStock
bitcoinist	eutopium-an-aim-towards-education	eUtopium: An aim towards Education - Bitcoinist.com	2014-07-24T04:42	eUtopium is a coin which is currently in a crowdfunding period, more of a IPO in my eyes, but consider it whatever you want to consider it as. eUtopium will start out with a proof of work phase that will last a year running on the NIST5 algorithm. The reason for this is because it is more energy efficient, which causes less heat production and consequently, a lower load on the computer’s processing power. Once the year has passed, the coin will pass on to a proof of security phase. The goal for eUtopium is made quite clear, if it’s achievable, that’s a mystery. Short answer, eUtopium is a coin that aims to aid education through the funding of academic work. The distribution of eUtopium will be through crowdfunding, and once finished, through mining. The crowdfunding accounts for 20% of the total coins for eUtopium, and the mining period immediately after will account for another 20% of the coins. Afterwards, 60% will be distributed through a longer mining phase that will last approximately 10 months. This chart explains the distribution model in a more organized and clear manner: Other than this, eUtopium claims to use a Proof-of-Fairness mechanism, which according to the site: “A fair-price mechanism will be in place, in order to uphold fairness. The initial crowdfunding phase will take place over a period of 7 days, or less. During this phase, 20% of the maximum eUtopium supply will be released to all worthy investors, for they have taken the largest risk in this ongoing experiment. An unlimited BTC can be invested, because you make the choice. Hence this is fair, because I do not dictate. There is a maximum cap BTC, which is undisclosed to you. There is a cap, but u don’t know; for when hits, then all will know.” Personally, I have mixed feelings regarding eUtopium, especially with the crowdfunding period at the beginning. There is no telling where this project goes, but the goal they have set is certainly an interesting one. To fund academic work is no joke, and if executed properly, the benefits to those whose academic work relies on eUtopium would be huge. All I hope is that they actually make a push in order to fund academic work, which would in turn, in my opinion, increase education through the use of cryptocurrency. However, one can never be sure, and this is no diferent. In regards to this coin, I say you consider it for as much time as you need, don’t be pressured, and if you don’t like what you see, don’t push yourself as I won’t push anyone. Even more so considering I have mixed feelings regarding this coin. All we can do is hope that the intentions are pure, and that something will actually be done. Scamcoin or not? Let the countdown to the 1st of august begin. Images Provided by BitcoinTalk thread of eUtopium
bitcoinist	exclusive-interview-blockchain-based-consulting-platform-experty	Exclusive Interview with Blockchain-based Consulting Platform Experty - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-06T19:00	In 2016, the global consulting services market was worth over $250 billion and that number is growing quickly. In addition to in-office consultations, many providers are incorporating an online consulting model as well. The problem facing these providers, however, is that the options available to track and facilitate payment for these online consultations are limited at best. Bitcoinist sat down with the Experty team to find out how their innovative blockchain-based consulting platform will revolutionize the way that consultants and their clients interact and do business online. Bitcoinist: What was the main impetus behind Experty? ET: We founded Experty to solve a problem that we have had with consultations in the past. Consultations aren’t that straightforward. You need to ask for payment in advance, ask for it afterward, or some mix of both. Sometimes you’ll need to go through an intermediary to make sure you get paid, which is costly and time-consuming. Experty was created to solve this problem. Bitcoinist: What is your experience in the consulting field? The blockchain field? ET: Our team is experienced in the consultations field, having come from the web consulting company ReactPoland. We’re very experienced in this area, and we know what problems currently face the consultations field. As for blockchain experience, our founders are well experienced with blockchain technology and share a similar passion for it. We want to see this succeed. Bitcoinist: How does Experty address the challenges that consultants and their clients face? ET: Experty uses blockchain technology to allow people to get paid by the minute for the time they spend on a consultation. This means that money is sent peer to peer for the exact length of any call. Bitcoinist: How is Experty different from current consultation platforms like Yondo and Quantifye? ET: Consultations AND payments through Experty are peer to peer. It’s a blockchain based platform that anyone in the world can use, regardless of location, identity, or national currency. Experty is taking the ball and chain off consultations. Bitcoinist: Is there an arbitration mechanism in place in case there is a dispute between consultant and client? ET: We plan to build a refund mechanism into the app. Bitcoinist: What are some of the most common use cases for Experty? ET: We see blockchain experts using it upon release, as there is a growing need for these experts, but not enough of them to hire directly. Experts can decide their own rates and take calls from clients in their own time. It’s similar to Uber in that sense. Bitcoinist: One of the features of Experty is its ability to be integrated into third-party platforms. Have any such platforms expressed an interest in integration? ET: Yes! We have had several different companies interested in doing this, including NewsBTC and MindSports. Bitcoinist: Are Experty tokens (EXY) a utility token or a security token? ET: They are a utility token, designed to be used within the application. Bitcoinist: How will EXY tokens be used within the Experty ecosystem? ET: The tokens are used to make payments to consultants using the app. EXY will be the primary form of payment. Our @Experty_io review is now live. We rate it 74/100, second highest rating ever on our platform. Congrats! https://t.co/c5WarIO0ef #experty — ICOdata.io (@ico_data) November 23, 2017 Bitcoinist: Can you explain what Proof-of-Care is and why you chose to implement it for your TGE pre-sale? ET: Proof-of-Care is a system to rewards the people that display that they care about Experty. People post on social media, write articles, make videos, and are rewarded for this with bonuses during the pre-sale. This means that the people who are most passionate about the project get more tokens. It’s about making the distribution more fair, and preventing whales from coming in and taking everything. Experty’s Proof-of-Care pre-sale is currently underway and will end on January 15, 2018. For more information about Experty, please visit experty.io and download their white paper. What do you think of Experty’s platform? How will it improve the consultation process for the consultant and the client? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Experty
bitcoinist	expectations-inside-bitcoins-new-york	Expectations For Inside Bitcoins NY - Bitcoinist.com	2015-04-27T15:00	Whenever I go to a conference, I always write an “expectations” article. In those articles, I pick out a couple of interesting speakers and panels that I want to hear. This year’s Inside Bitcoins New York conference is held at the Javits centre. The conference will be a three day event, starting at 12:00 PM EST on April 27th and ending at 5 PM on the 29 th. Also read: Barry Silbert to Speak at Inside Bitcoins New York Let us begin with the lectures. If you are new to the Bitcoin scene, I would advise attending the first lecture of the opening day, titled, “ Bitcoin for Beginners: Basics and Beyond. ” Another lecture that will undoubtedly be interesting is the second lecture on the 27 th : “ Bitcoin Security: A Practical Perspective. ”As the title suggests, this lecture looks at Bitcoin security and how we can better protect ourselves from all kinds of intrusions. This lecture will be for businesses as well as consumers, so it will be enlightening to say the least. The second day lectures are so fascinating that it is hard to pick out just two notable ones. The first lecture that I would recommend is “ New Ideas in Bitcoin. ” It will be great to hear what the start-ups and established Bitcoin businesses are creating, the difficulties they might encounter, etc. The second lecture that I chose is directly linked to the first: “Beyond Mt. Gox and Silk Road: Digital Currency’s Fight to Gain Mainstream Acceptance. ” This lecture will show the innovative drive of the cryptocurrency community and the struggle to gain general acceptance and trust. It might be possible that both sessions can complement each other and even offer solutions to one another during each individual session. The last day should be as fascinating as the previous 2 days. I chose “ The Crypto-Wars: Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Transaction,” because we have to think about the freedom of transaction. Why doesn’t the banking system serve the entire world? Only 49-51% of the global population has access to banking services — shouldn’t freedom of economic transaction be a basic human right? The last lecture that I chose is “ How To Make Bitcoin Easy For Small Business. ” I chose this article because I have written a lot of articles that highlight the benefits bitcoin provides to small and medium sized businesses to incorporate Bitcoin in their business model. It is quite hard to pick out just two notable people from speaker roster, which has about 98 names on it. The speakers are all quite interesting. In my opinion, the two most notable speakers are: Perianne Boring : She is the Founder and president of the Chamber of digital commerce. I would love to hear her views on the current proposal on regulation. Peter Kirby: He is the President of Factom. That company is focusing in on the possibilities with Blockchain technology for businesses. Suffice it to say, the Inside Bitcoins NY conference will be quite interesting and packed with crypto enthusiasts and speakers alike. I would like to invite you all to come and strike up a conversation with me, Bitcoinist CEO Mate Tokay, or Bitcoinist Editor-in-Chief Scott Fargo. We would love to hear your opinions, stories and experiences in the crypto world! This author’s views may not necessarily be those of Bitcoinist.net.

bitcoinist	facebook-investor-paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-bets-big-bitcoin-wins	Facebook Investor and PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel Bets Big on Bitcoin - and Wins - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-02T20:30	Facebook early investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel bought millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin through his VC firm, Founders Fund, and that number is cited to be worth hundreds of millions today. Venture Capitalists Jumping on the Bitcoin Bandwagon Peter Thiel runs the Founders Fund, a venture capitalist firm. Reports are showing that the firm purchased somewhere between $15 and 20 million dollars’ worth of the Bitcoin throughout 2017, and thanks to the massive price surge that investment is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The leading cryptocurrency is up over 1,400% since the beginning of 2017, with a recent all-time high of $20,000 being hit in early December. Since the original report, which was published in The Wall Street Journal, the price of Bitcoin has jumped just over 11%, topping out at $15,000 at the time of writing. It is unknown if the firm as sold any of its current holdings, but the Founder’s Fund Bitcoin portfolio is assumed to be the largest piece of the firm’s $1.3 billion venture fund. Mainstream Adoption Continues Many traditional financial institutions have turned away from cryptocurrency, with worries about volatile prices and overall legitimacy at the top of the list of their concerns. But in recent months, however, some have overcome their reluctance and are actually beginning to integrate Bitcoin and other digital currencies into their systems. CME Group and CBOE are only two such companies to do so, having launched Bitcoin futures trading on their respective exchanges in the last weeks of 2017. Elsewhere in the world, some countries are looking to adopt existing cryptocurrencies while others have plans to launch their own state-sponsored versions. In Japan, Bitcoin is already treated as legal tender, while Russia is currently drafting legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies and ICOs. ICOs, in particular, have raised red flags in the past, and regulation could bring some stability to the crypto space. Belarus has completely legalized Bitcoin and ICOs, and on top of this made them completely tax-free for five years. What do you think of their investment? Do you think this will bring in more investors into the space? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pexels

The Ditch-it app which will be available in the App Store and Google Play brings a much superior app to the mobile classified ads space. Ditch-it was able to achieve this by integrating the platform with Electroneum blockchain technology, increasing security and minimizing the risk for the user. Ditch-it provides safer meet-ups for users than other classified platforms such as Craigslist, Offer-Up and Letgo because it verifies user’s identities. The Ditch-it platform also lets users buy and sell with video and includes a social newsfeed similar to Facebook. The Ditch-it app uses native DICH tokens, but is also a great way to stock up on Electroneum as they sell it as well. The DICH token is a super secure crypto-currency that has all of the benefits of Bitcoin, but more. Transactions on the Ditch-it platform happen faster and are more anonymous than other apps. DICH tokens can be redeemed on the Ditch-it app for add credits or used between users as a way to barter or trade. The Ditch-it tokens can be bought for investment purposes or to use solely within the app. During a recent press event, the company spokesperson for Ditch-it was quoted as saying, “We want to connect billions of the world’s smartphone users so they may engage and connect socially and commercially.” He went on to say, “We created the Ditch-it platform for everyone that’s tired of the rat race and ready to build their own block of cheese. The mission of Ditch-it is to enable a more secure and personal interaction between brands and people. The number one possession people have is their smartphone and there are more mobile devices than people on the planet. Mobile is the way people interact with friends and brands. Digital currency is our future and we plan to be leaders in this new and exciting space.” The Ditch-it ICO has created quite a buzz in the world of Digital Currencies as investors flock to the best ICO’s hoping to cash in on the ground floor and pave the way for their retirement. Analysts have been predicting that this ICO may be among the top ICO’s of the year because of the exponential growth of the Ditch-It user base as well as company expansion. The Ditch-It platform has already soft-launched in 9 U.S. States and several other countries, with great success. When the Ditch-it app launches 1 DICH token will give you $1 in ad credits, so Ditch-it will not rely heavily on exchanges.

bitcoinist	fbi-warns-about-bitcoin-murder-scam	FBI Warns About Bitcoin Murder Scam - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-27T07:00	A new extortion scheme has caught the attention of the FBI in which a Bitcoin scam is undertaken through an emailed death threat. There are lots of ways that crooks try to extort money from their victims via the internet. Some of their tricks of the trade include sending infected emails or remote hacking. However, a new extortion attempt is proving to be downright scary and has attracted the attention of the FBI. Basically, the extortion attempt is a Bitcoin scam in which the victim is threatened with murder unless they pay up. Scared for Your Life One victim told her story to the media. She said that she received an email that said, “I will be short. I’ve got an order to kill you.” Her only recourse to supposedly save her life was to pay the would-be-assassin $2,800 in Bitcoin. Needless to say, the victim was scared to hell by this murderous Bitcoin scam. She told the media: I knew no one was tracking me. But I found myself as I was on my way to work looking around. Are any cars following me? Does anyone look suspicious? Online Death Threats Not Uncommon While one would think that such an incident would be rare, it’s actually more common than you think. The victim contacted the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center over the death threat. About the agency’s website, FBI agent Laura Eimiller says : We receive an average of 800 complaints a day in the United States on that site. We believe it represents about 15 percent of the scams that are actually taking place, so it is heavily underreported. Agent Eimiller goes on to say that if you’re online, chances are that you will be victimized multiple times with various scams and threats. She adds that the current Bitcoin scam involving death threats is easy money for criminals as they rely upon volume. She states: If only 1 percent of people send money to them, there’s no overhead for them. That is money in the bank. Police authorities say that even educated professionals have been lured in by the emails. The reason being that the emails containing the death threats have been carefully constructed. In short, this isn’t your old Nigerian scam email. Plus, having a death threat show up in your inbox is enough to freak any sane person out. While the internet does allow us instant communication and access across the world, it does open us up to attacks from bad guys just using a keyboard. The best thing to do if you get such a murderous Bitcoin scam email is to not answer it. Contact the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center and register a complaint. Have you ever received a death threat in an email? If so, what did you do? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay, Wikimedia Commons, and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	film-review-dope-2015	Dope (2015) Film Review - Bitcoinist.com	2015-08-03T15:00	[ezcol_1quarter] ★★★★/5 Director: Rick Famuyiwa Feature Film, Coming-Of-Age Drama/Comedy Starring: Shameik Moore Tony Revolori Kiersey Clemons Kimberly Elise Rakim Mayers (aka A$AP Rocky) Blake Anderson Running Time: 1 hour 55 minutes Rated: R [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_3quarter_end] It opens with a textbook definition: Illegal drugs, an idiot, and slang for cool: Dope. Definitions are at the core of this film, Dope (2015), which takes place in “the Bottoms” of Inglewood, California: the textbook definition of ‘a bad place,’ characterized by its gang wars and its drugs, by its failing high school and its youth who are trapped in its system. We follow three of those youth, Malcolm, Diggy, and Jib — geeky kids who are starstruck by the 90s, a classic feel-good time of post-Cold War America unsettled by the boiling racial tensions that uneasily beckon to this day. Everything here is defined: the geeks, the bad education, the nostalgia, the drugs, the money, the Bloods, and the Crips. But the film itself is not a textbook definition — instead, the film is about the redefining; central to this film is more than just the labels and the stereotyping, but an energetic and honest redefinition of life. After all, this is the 21st century and in the 21st century, there exists Bitcoin. The main character, Malcolm, actually opens the film by explaining what Bitcoin is to his mother. Immediately, Malcolm is a geek, but he’s black, and he’s got a flat-top for hair. His two friends Diggy and Jib are just as ‘whack,’ with one being a lesbian, and the other just as oddball. But that’s no matter, it’s reality. Before long, you’re riding with his friends as they end up in the crossfire between gangs and police, unknowingly carrying several kilos of MDMA. They don’t have the option of returning back to normal life — you either move or you die. So they move their MDMA through the Deep Web, selling on a Silk Road-inspired site and avoiding the Feds, partially to strong-arm a Harvard alumnus into helping Malcolm’s acceptance to the school, but also to avoid getting killed — a task that is harrowingly manifested in a bloodied gameboy. It’s this modernity which makes the film so intriguingly refreshing. Harking back to its roots, it’s got the daring storytelling elements of Jackie Brown (1997) with the heart-wrenching honesty of Do The Right Thing (1989), but it is also renewed, not only with the revitalized music themes or the surprising depth of A$AP Rocky’s acting role, but by steeping the characters in the digital age. In this, the internet and bitcoin take center stage to demonstrate the changing tides of liberation for a community of poor minorities who need something more than the DEA and FBI to hawk over them or a dropout factory of a school — they need magic internet money, the Deep Web, and will to live. Liberation is actually very prevalent as a theme; the kids need to go through a metal detector with a security officer at the other end just to get into school. The police do drug sweeps randomly. The gangs stand around at every inopportune moment. Federal agents shoot up a birthday party after the drug pushers talk about drone strikes. Not long after, people get shot by already illegal guns and do even more illegal drugs. Blood and money flows while our main characters only try to make better-than-worst decisions. It’s a pervasive sense of dread that reminds me of Boyz n The Hood (1991), or worse yet, the very real communities of Baltimore or Ferguson. But it’s not about any white-on-black violence or racially-motivated crime, it’s about the eerie calm of resignation that comes from generations of living in the Bottoms; everything screams out that life here is a prison. Yet this, the ‘black experience’ is also under the careful magnifying glass of director Rick Famuyiwa as well as notable producers Pharrell Williams and Forest Whitaker. In examining what it means to be black, but also get good grades and aim for not just graduating, but attending college, Harvard even, Dope seeks to redefine the ‘black identity.’ It’s a difficult task to take on, but with inroads made by Kendrick Lamar and Ava Duvarney, to Spike Lee and Melvin Van Peebles, in the same few years as massive race tensions, it’s a discussion that at the very least needs to come into the light of the mainstream. And yet, this film remains impetuously optimistic. Inglewood is crafted in love. The music curation for the score is impeccable. And there are whole sequences in the film that reminds us that life is moving forward, with or without the old ideas of government control, with or without the Drug War, the money tracking, the racial stereotypes and the virtual imprisonment of the people of the Bottoms. Bitcoin is king. The Deep Web is king. The internet is king. In fact, there’s a whole scene that recreates the night before through what we see through filter of Facebook and Twitter to Instagram and Youtube. We are nowhere and somewhere at the same time, an ulterior state of being where we can both escape and expose the conditions of living under the thumb of police and gangs, both of whom are are treated almost as ubiquitous oppressors wearing different clothes. The final beats of the film are critical — and its most honest. After such a journey with Malcolm, director Rick Famuyiwa gives us a chance to not look away, but to look in ourselves. Beyond the wit and joy, there are deep motives behind the drastic measures of the story – ones that seem impossible to anyone outside of the Drug War Zone. The complexities of life that Famuyiwa expresses presents a stark reality where there is no silver-bullet or even a clear distinction of what is good or bad. Even for geeks and ‘good kids,’ life isn’t simple — and that ain’t dope. Have you seen Dope? Let us know in the comments below! Image: Dope (2015) [/ezcol_3quarter_end]
bitcoinist	five-ways-to-spend-bitcoins-in-2018	Five Ways To Spend Bitcoins in 2018 - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-19T16:30	While there’s no doubt that Bitcoin is the currency of the moment, with its value rising from $0.0008 on inception, to a peak of $17,900 in December 2017, one of the biggest concerns that potential investors have is that, in reality, they are difficult to spend. With skeptics referring to horror stories such as the man who spent 10,000 Bitcoins on two pizzas in 2010 (an equivalent cost in today’s market of $20 million), it’s easy to see why spending this currency has become contentious. Many argue that realizing the value potential of Bitcoin depends on holding on to it – but what’s the point in a currency that no one is willing to spend? If you are one of the few Bitcoin holders that wish to part ways with the red-hot cryptocurrency while its stock is still rising, there are actually many legitimate and useful ways to cash it in. Let’s take a look: At Online Games and Gambling Online is the easiest and most obvious place to spend a cryptocurrency, which opens up a range of fun ways to spend your leisure time in cyberspace. Enjoying the online games at a bitcoin casino will mean that you also get the added bonus of having the potential to win and add to your investment. You can have a look at #1 Bitcoin Casino Guide – Cryptocurrencies for Gambling and get yourself more detailed information about this. There are multiple online Bitcoin casinos to choose from, featuring all your usual casino favorites like slot machine games, card games such as blackjack and poker, dice games and roulette. The advantages of using Bitcoin to gamble online are that the player can remain anonymous and that transactions are instant with virtually no fees involved. The no-fee advantage also extends to operators, who can avoid transaction fees and credit card chargebacks, which is sure to fuel the growth of this new online casino industry even further. On a Holiday Another industry that operates largely online nowadays is the travel industry, which is quickly warming to the idea of accepting Bitcoin, following the lead of travel giant Expedia. And if you want to carry the casino theme on through your holiday, the Golden Gate Casino Hotel was one of the first to accept Bitcoin as payment in the hotel and restaurant, in 2014. If you’re organized, it may even be possible to travel the world spending only Bitcoins, as Felix Weis proved during an 18-month trip that encompassed 27 countries. You can read his story here. On a Gift Card While Fortune.com laments that Bitcoin is intangible, thus making it very difficult to spend in reality, there are some simple ways around this online-only issue. One solution is to exchange the currency for a gift card that you can spend in popular stores. Gyft is the most used platform for purchasing gift cards using cryptocurrency, and you can choose from over 200 retailers including Apple, Bloomingdales, Hotels.com, Nike, Sephora, Macy’s and Starbucks. GiftOff, in the UK, offers cards for Amazon, Arcadia group stores such as Topman and Topshop, Argos, Costa Coffee, Debenhams, and Tesco. On IT Services Assuming that the target market of Bitcoins is likely to be tech-savvy and very comfortable with all things cyber, it comes as no surprise that the largest area of spend for the Bitcoin is IT. Many computer companies accept Bitcoin payments on certain things, including computing giant Microsoft, which lets you use Bitcoin to purchase some online content, and Dell, which offers Bitcoin as a payment option on hardware such as computers and laptops. The currency can also be used to pay for online services such as web hosting and domain names, making it a handy currency for business owners and online professionals. Donate it to Charity If you’re feeling altruistic, there’s no better way to spend your Bitcoin profits than on a charity donation. Many charities, including The Water Project, World Aid for Homeless Children, and the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) accept Bitcoin donations. According to CNBC, $22 million Bitcoins were donated in 2017 – which is a smart way to avoid capital gains tax on an appreciating asset, while doing good at the same time. Whether you choose to spend your Bitcoins on hotel stays or want to gamble on the chance of making even more on your cryptocurrency investment with a flutter at an online casino, the buzz around Bitcoin is making it easier than ever to spend what’s currently the world’s most exciting new currency — that’s if you want to, of course! What are some other ways you can think of to spend your bitcoins? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Reuters, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	flixxo-a-swarm-of-individuals-connected	Flixxo: A Swarm of Individuals Connected - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-10T23:00	Like many other industries being disrupted by blockchain today, content sharing platforms are facing new challenges in their quest to meet the new consumer trends and needs. The obvious synergy behind blockchain technologies and p2p content sharing protocols (i.e. torrents) has brought to life a new generation of decentralized online services that are on the heels of such market’s giants as YouTube, Twitch, and Netflix. To explore the nascent future of this industry Bitcoinist talked to Adrián Garelick, CEO of Flixxo. Adrián is the industry veteran, best known for having created RSK Labs. His new project, Flixxo, is a video sharing network, which employs distributed storage and BitTorrent protocol to store and share the content. Flixxo launched a token sale campaign on October 24 which will end in 30 days or once the hard cap of 75,000 ETH is reached. Bitcoinist: Both torrents and video sharing platforms revolutionized the paradigm of content sharing. One was a service allowing users to share free and often shady content, no questions asked. Another introduced the concept of monetizations and created online billionaire celebrities. What middle ground is Flixxo seeking? Or is it creating something completely different? AG: I love this metaphor I´ve heard from a Youtuber “We are building beautiful houses on a piece of land we are renting from someone else”. With Flixxo, a video creator is building on top of his/her own network of followers. On top of his own land. This is only achievable by using p2p distribution systems, in which every user, every subscriber or follower, is making author´s network stronger. In this ecosystem, the creator of content sets the rules on top of his/her content and he/she can reward his/her fans. And the consumers have the power to bring wealth to the author, incentivizing him/her to create more content. Bitcoinist: Modern online media is slowly shifting from pre-recorded material to lifestreams. Torrents are also shifting in collective perception from a hip tech to a dumpster for pirated content. Bearing in mind these two trends, what in your opinion will help Flixxo stay relevant and cool? AG: I find torrents and blockchain similar technologies and also comparable in the collective perception. At the beginning blockchain (represented by Bitcoin) was accused to be a technology for money laundering and financing drug trafficking. Finally, financial institutions and governments found that it was an amazing technology that could be used for their own benefit. On the side of torrents, the protocol has been accused by big movies studios of only being used for piracy… when it has already proved to be a compelling technology for media distribution. Instead of adopting the protocol to their own benefit, they´ve decided to fight against it. Instead of exploring the possibilities, they´ve chosen to ban it. And studios didn’t succeed in stopping torrents, because of their decentralized nature. In this context Flixxo takes the most out of both technologies and creates a synergy, encouraging seeding of legal content. And about lifestreams, there will always be space for quality pre-recorded videos. It is not only about what is happening right now in someone´s life, it is about good storytelling and quality content. However, torrents can be used for live stream and it is on our roadmap to explore that path. Bitcoinist: Professional content creators depend on centralized platforms to offer their content to huge audiences and monetize the views. Will Flixxo be able to offer YouTubers comparable audience and monetary rewards? Please explain the math behind the platform if possible. AG: We cannot bring four billion views to the next “Despacito”, but we can really help monetizing authors from a few thousand to some million views per month. These authors are making from nothing to pennies out of their productions on YouTube. In our platform, they get paid every time a user hits the play button. We have developed a complete economy in which consumers, who need Flixx to play a video, can earn tokens by watching advertising or by becoming distributors of content. So almost every token that comes from advertising goes to the wallet of the content producers, and they can exchange the tokens to fiat or to any crypto with liquidity, directly from advertisers. We were surprised that premium content creators, with more than 1 billion views on YouTube, reached out to us and showed interest in bringing their content to the platform! Bitcoinist: How will you incentivize people to join Flixxo, both content creators and consumers? AG: For authors, we will launch a campaign in which we assume the role of co-producers of original content for Flixxo, in exchange they will have to invite their YouTube followers to our platform. For users we have reserved 500M tokens that will be distributed during ten years, and will reward certain social benchmarks (e.g. having distributed their first five videos, having sent or received two tokens with friends, etc) These incentive tokens will end up in the hands of content creators, encouraging them to bring more content to the platform, and more quality content will bring more users. We will need to be smart and to be ready to deal with this fragile flow. Bitcoinist: To draw an audience to Flixxo, you’d probably want creators involved with Flixxo to no longer post anything on YouTube. Won’t content creators who keep sharing their content on YouTube even after joining Flixxo be nigh useless for Flixxo’s development? In other words, how important is exclusive content and how will you fight for it? AG: Once authors find out that they can create a better profit out of their exclusive videos, they will stop posting them on YouTube. We are offering a new model, this new model may require a different content than the content they post on Youtube. So, some content creators would feel comfortable with this model and would be protective of their Flixxo content, and some of them would still prefer posting on both platforms. Bitcoinist: A huge issue for current content creators is non-transparent and often draconian censorship policies centralized platforms observe. How will Flixxo make sure censorship is not a problem for anyone who is at least not creating criminal content according to international law? AG: Flixxo is a platform and a network. As a platform, we’ve decided to stay family-friendly and to not allow certain content (such as pornography). However, the network cannot be censored and anyone is able to build a platform for their content on top of it. Back to the house metaphor, it is your own land, is up to you to build the house you want to build. Bitcoinist: Futurists suggest that in the online world of tomorrow content sharing services will become concepts much broader than how we understand them today. Perhaps we will see social media become one huge conglomerate of imaginable services. In your opinion, how does Flixxo push the humanity in that particular direction? How do you see it evolve? AG: At the end, it is always about human interactions. All the actual models of interactions rely on third parties, on triangles. There is always author, consumer, and YouTube; he, she and Facebook; client, retailer, and Visa. Flixxo is an ecosystem in which people interact without intermediaries: our network is a swarm of individuals connected, with a common interest in sharing audiovisual content. A network where video content is the language in which they communicate with each other. Directly with each other, without outsiders monetizing on their interactions or messing up the communication. For more information about Flixxo and the services they offer, please visit their company website at flixxo.com. Do you think the prospect of better monetization will be enough to woo content producers away from YouTube and on to Flixxo? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Flixxo
bitcoinist	flop-ethereum-price-crashing	Flippening Flop? Ethereum Price is Crashing Amid Bubble Fears	2017-06-26T07:30	Ethereum price is crashing at an alarming speed. Could the Ether bubble be real? If so, has it finally popped? Ethereum Price Drops Over 15% Ether, the underlying currency in the Ethereum blockchain, is losing value on the price charts, having dropped $47.44 (-15.51%) in the last 24 hours. Currently sitting at $259, Ether continues to drop at an alarming rate, causing investors to wonder if the bubble mentioned by several members of the community is now coming to an end. “WhalePanda”, a prominent member in the Bitcoin community, previously warned about the prospect of a bubble in his blog post dubbed “I was wrong about Ethereum”. Now, as the price drops, WhalePanda has pointed out one of the possible reasons as to why the price is declining so quickly. He tweeted: It looks like some bigger ICOs have started selling their $ETH, wonder if demand of new ICOs can keep up with that sell pressure + mining. — WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) June 26, 2017 Ethereum’s impressive rally has caused the cryptocurrency to become more popular than ever, even outdoing Bitcoin in Google Search trends. However, it’s accentuated growth may also have caused many to invest in Ether based on speculation alone, oblivious to the actual project and to the problems and challenges it still faces. What Goes Up… Although Ether has brought profit to those who have held it since the beginning of the year, many investors are buying Ether under the impression that the crypto token is meant to be used as a store of value or currency. However, Ether’s only purpose is to serve as the “gas” that fuels smart contracts and decentralized applications on the network. As so, an increase in the price can lead to dApps becoming too expensive to use. Most users are also not aware of the scalability issues that are currently found in the network. Ethereum is far from being enterprise ready with its network problems becoming more evident every day. Not only is the Ethereum blockchain growing at an exponential rate due to its stateful nature, it is also experiencing congestions during large traffic volume event like the recent Status ICO. Smart Contracts and dApps on the network also run the risk of becoming invalid in the future, as miners define the gas limit accepted. Although Ethereum has great potential, it has many challenges ahead, and now, just like Ethereum’s growth has been largely moved by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and lack of information, its accentuated crash comes in the midst of panic sales from users who may have no idea what Ethereum is and what problems it faces. ICOs & ICOs Dumping One of the driving factors in Ethereum’s growth was the number and size of ICOs that have taken place on the network since the beginning of year. These projects have gathered millions and millions of dollars every week, with campaigns becoming larger and more ambitious every time, one of which (Bancor) has even surpassed The DAO. Many ICOs in 2016 resulted in tremendous profits for investors, causing the concept to become widely popular among investors who sought to invest more heavily. In 2017, ICOs grew in number, with most of the iconic ones using Ethereum as a platform for smart contract and token issuance, causing the demand for Ether (ETH) to grow, given that it’s the most direct and often the only way to invest in these ICOs. Now, however, the most exciting periods for ICOs seems to have passed, with major projects like Gnosis, Status and Civic completing their respective funding campaigns. This could be one of the driving factors behind the dropping price. Not only has demand for Ether been reduced by the lack of major ICOs, the available supply may also have increased as these projects liquidate their ETH in order to fund development, as noted by WhalePanda. However, it’s also worth noting that large amounts of cryptocurrency are usually sold in OTC. Is the Ether bubble real? Will its price recover? Let us know your thoughts on the comment section.

bitcoinist	future-digital-wallet	The Future of the Digital Wallet - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-26T16:00	The origins of the digital wallet cannot be pinned down exactly. All we know is that the idea had actually circulated around in the late 90’s, but few utilized it. A couple of entrepreneurial companies such as eBay came up with early e-payment programs – but they failed due to poor publicity. We would come to know this as the era of the first generation of digital wallets. Fast forward two decades and a technological revolution later, and we are currently in the third generation of digital wallets. And as they say, the third time’s the charm. Unlike the first generation of digital wallets, the second generation actually had a substantial number of backers that commanded authority in the financial sphere, such as MasterCard and Visa. However, there was one large issue with this generation of digital wallet services, and that was the lack of simplification and integration of the solutions. For example, the MasterCard wallet would only work with MasterCard, the Visa wallet would only work with Visa, and so on and so forth. Convenience then became an issue, because none of these solutions let you store ALL your credit card information in one place. Ultimately, it became troublesome to use them, a glaring complication in a generation in which everything is available one click away. The third generation of digital wallets fixes this complication, and its arrival was received with much fanfare and welcoming arms. Essentially, they are secure systems that store payment information from as many credit cards as you own, as well as multiple passwords for a range of exchanges and websites you engage with. They are designed to hold cryptocurrency the way physical wallets are designed to hold physical currency. They can be accessed conveniently from a PC or smartphone. So with the advent of blockchain and a new generation of e-payment, what exactly is the future of the digital wallet? What can we be looking forward to in the upcoming years? What we can be looking forward to is the integration of multiple services, all on a single platform. Several projects have succeeded massively in doing so. Such examples would be the renowned AliPay in China or PayTM in India, both densely populated and influential countries in the fintech sector. The undeniable fact is that cryptocurrency is slowly mainstreaming, and will be used for daily transactions among common folk. Other parts of Asia such as Korea and Singapore are quickly catching up with the current cryptocurrency craze as well; a number of new projects and start-ups in Korea and Singapore are set to launch this year. “It’s interesting, the way money has evolved from the barter system to the monetary system, and now to the digital system,” points out Deng Guangyuan, the founder of SGPay, creator of a 3 rd generation digital wallet with several built-in innovative and integrative services. “I believe that the future of the digital wallet is now. It is up to us to come up with inventive ideas that make use of this system fully and with purpose.” The company aims to raise 4.8 million USD through an initial coin offering (ICO) for the SGPay Token that spans the course of February. SGPay is an ambitious project primed to launch an all-in-one digital wallet by June 2018. It is, admittedly, one of the most exciting new projects based in Southeast Asia to come out this year. To learn more about the project and get involved in its ICO, visit http://www.sgpay.org. Would you use an all-in-one e-wallet platform like SGPay? What are the benefits of such a platform? Are there any drawbacks? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of SGPay, Shutterstock

As a result, cryptocurrency exchanges are already taking precautionary measures. Bitcoin’s Volatility About to Increase Bitcoin’s price fluctuations are wild. Its price can swing by more than $3,000 USD in just a few hours. Traditionally, volatility is measured by the volatility index, also known as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). However, as of this writing, Bitcoin does not yet have a generally accepted index. Bitcoin futures trading is here. CBOE Global Markets will start trading Bitcoin futures (XBT) on December 10, 2017. Then CME Group will launch Bitcoin futures, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), on December 18, 2017. And, according to Bloomberg, NASDAQ might be planning to launch Bitcoin futures sometime in 2018. How will futures trading affect Bitcoin’s price volatility? Nobody knows. Allice Lloyd George, an investor at RRE Ventures, posed this very question to Arthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, who already has firsthand experience running cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges in Hong Kong. George asked Hayes whether futures markets will help the ecosystem and smooth out volatility. Hayes replied: Initially, because of the way these contracts are structured, they will actually increase the volatility of Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin exchanges are getting ready to face an upsurge in volatility when the trading of Bitcoin futures contracts starts. Already, Bitcoin is swinging to the downside by a fifth of its value, hours before the starting of futures trading. Bitcoin’s Inelasticity Drives its Price Volatility There is an array of factors that drives Bitcoin’s volatility, such as adverse press which in turn affects adoption rate. In addition, other factors are government treatment of the cryptocurrency, and hackings of Bitcoin exchanges. Moreover, Bitcoin is inherently volatile because of its illiquidity. By design, only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined. This lack of liquidity makes Bitcoin inflation-resistant and incentivizes miners. Furthermore, illiquidity makes Bitcoin inelastic, and hence volatile. Investopedia defines elasticity: Elasticity refers the degree to which individuals, consumers or producers change their demand or the amount supplied in response to price or income changes. As Erik Norland, Executive Director and Senior Economist, CME Group, explains: No matter how high prices go, miners will not produce more than 21 million coins. Moreover, price increases won’t necessarily incentivize a more rapid mining of bitcoin. Even if they did, it would only influence miners to create more bitcoin today at the expense of creating less in the future since the total supply will reach a hard, asymptotic limit of 21 million coins. The supply inelasticity explains in large part why bitcoin is so volatile. Bitcoin is a battle-tested, sturdy animal. Time and again, it has demonstrated itself to be remarkably resilient. Now, Bitcoin is about to be tested by the new environment that futures trading will impose. Bitcoin will undoubtedly show once again its inherent capacity to quickly adjust to an ever-changing environment, and then, with renewed force, it will continue its ever ascending trajectory. How do you think futures trading will affect Bitcoin’s volatility?? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay
bitcoinist	game-machine-the-easy-way-to-invest-in-the-gaming-industry	Game Machine - the Easy Way to Invest in the Gaming Industry - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-26T18:00	The gaming industry is reportedly worth in excess of $115 billion worldwide. There are over 2.3 billion gamers across the planet and over 55,000 new titles were released in 2017. This is set to expand as smartphone technology evolves with ever more powerful hardware and graphics capabilities. Millennials are spending more time gaming than any other generation before them and players are still flocking to PCs as well as consoles to get their fixes. Gaming Benefits for All One startup seeking to offer investment opportunities in this flourishing industry is Game Machine, which has garnered over 60,000 users since its launch two months ago. By involving all three parties, gamers, developers, and investors the company has an ambitious aim to provide a blockchain platform to nurture a transparent ecosystem between all players. Gamers will benefit by gaining access to upgrades, in-game items, and new titles. In addition to this, they will have the ability to mine cryptocurrency for trade within the ecosystem on a mining app which has already been developed for Windows and Android. An iOS app is scheduled for later this year. According to Game Machine, over 20,000 gamers are already mining and using the GMC token for in-game purchases. An app for developers is in the pipeline for later this year. They will be able to use the app and platform to promote their latest titles without having to pay heavy commissions to third-party companies. Investors also have the advantage of making informed and safe investments into gaming projects and companies. A crowdfunded platform powered by in-depth gaming analytics data will provide investors a window into the most profitable products and those with the greatest interest from gamers. Investment and ICO Game Machine unites this triumvirate with its blockchain based platform to bestow mutually beneficial opportunities for all parties. The team has already used $80,000 of their own funds to create the app, a further $120,000 followed from early investors. The ongoing token sale has already generated over $1.5 million since the ICO began in mid-December. The token sale ends on January 31 The GMiT token will be used for investment in the project whereas the GMC token is a temporary currency for Game Machine platform clients. Following the roadmap to June this year GMiT tokens will be exchanged for GameFuel, the in-game cryptocurrency that will power the entire platform. The Game Machine client is a fully working platform with thousands of customers already using and mining digital tokens. The appeal to gamers is a strong one as they can mine the tokens themselves rather than spending their hard earned on upgrades and gaming items. Tokens purchased during the ICO will be listed on a number of exchanges and made available for resales to gamers and developers. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are changing the way we do business, purchase commodities, make investments, and now enjoy our favorite games.

bitcoinist	gladius-how-blockchain-technology-is-making-the-web-safer-and-faster	Gladius: How Blockchain Technology Is Making the Web Safer and Faster - Bitcoinist.com	2017-10-14T13:00	DDoS attacks are one of the most common problems on the internet. However, blockchain technology may hold the key to a safer and more pleasant internet, an avenue that is being explored by the Gladius project. New Technology Brings New Problems With the inception of new technologies, new problems are also sure to arise and “malicious actors” are usually among the first to take advantage of these problems, using exploits in new systems to disrupt businesses and individuals, profiting at their expense. The internet is a perfect example. An amazing tool that allows us to connect to each other and access “endless” knowledge is also home to many criminals and scammers. DDoS or Distributed Denial-of-service attacks are one of the most common problems on the internet. A DDoS attack is when one of these malicious actors or more floods a website or server with useless traffic and/or requests, resulting in the website being overloaded. This can, of course, have an impact on the website’s revenue. Distributed Denial-of-service attacks are just one of the many problems that plague the web and although solutions exist, they are far from perfect. Traditional DDoS protection services are often expensive and inefficient, relying on a subscription model that forces webmasters to pay a lot more than what they need or use. Needless to say that smaller websites often go unprotected due to the lack of revenue to pay for these inefficient services. However, blockchain technology may hold the key to a safer and more pleasant internet both for the webmaster and the user, an avenue that is being explored by the Gladius project. Previous platforms like Storj or Filecoin have shown us that it is possible to skip these subscription models enforced by traditional companies with centralized structures through the use of decentralized networks. The Blockchain solution While Storj and Filecoin have applied this concept to the cloud storage industry, the idea of decentralized networks as service providers can be leveraged for other purposes, as long as the users (nodes) that constitute said network are incentivized. That’s where blockchain technology comes in. Cryptocurrencies allow for secure, quick, and cheap payments to be made to the nodes providing the service. This is exactly what Gladius is trying to do. By creating a network of people who can lend their idle or unused bandwidth, Gladius is able to provide companies and webmasters with an efficient DDoS protection mechanism where the client only pays for what he uses. This same network is also leveraged by Gladius to provide a new and improved Content Delivery Network (CDN) where the same rules apply, the client only pays for what he uses. So essentially, Gladius is aiming to accelerate the entire internet by turning every computer to a mini CDN. The outcome is faster geo-serving than centralized CDN’s (more distribution of data centers). It’ll also be safer than current DDoS protection solutions, due to blockchain encryption and the fact hackers will need to remove thousands of nodes around the internet to shut the system down. The people running the Gladius software and providing these services are in turn rewarded with Gladius (GLA), an Ethereum ERC20 token used as the native currency of the network which can be bought on exchanges by the clients that want to receive DDoS protection or use the CDN. The GLA token will also be available during an upcoming token sale. The Gladius white paper reads: “Anyone with a computer can download and run the Gladius peer client in the background to rent out their unused bandwidth and earn Gladius Tokens (GLA). Large pools with hundreds, if not thousands, of nodes will then be able to handle a continuous stream of requests to validate website connections and block malicious activity.” By leveraging blockchain technology, Gladius is not only able to provide a cheaper service for companies and webmasters, it is also creating a revenue stream for regular people who happen to have extra bandwidth, thus distributing the wealth that would be normally reserved for a handful of stockholders. Will Blockchain technology continue to open the door for new and efficient business models? Is Gladius the key to solve DDoS attacks?

bitcoinist	global-bank-threat-hackers-crack-swift	Global Banking System Under Threat As Hackers Crack NSA, SWIFT Again - Bitcoinist.com	2017-04-15T14:00	Hacker group Shadow Brokers has allegedly proved that the US National Security Agency (NSA) hacked SWIFT international banking network. NSA ‘Documents And Files’ Show SWIFT Transactions ‘Monitored’ In “documents and files” released Friday, Reuters reports, the group said it had evidence the NSA used SWIFT to “ monitor money flows among some Middle Eastern and Latin American banks.” The news marks the second time Shadow Brokers has laid claim to compromising NSA secrets. In August 2016, the group said it had entered an agency affiliate and taken details of cyberweapons, which it planned to auction for one million bitcoins. If true, it is also a further blow to SWIFT, which last year recorded several high-level security failures worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “NSA hacked a bunch of banks, oil and investment companies in Palestine, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Yemen, more,” Mustafa Al-Bassam, computer science researcher at University College London, commented on the findings. Bitcoin Core Dev: Implications Beyond Spying ‘Burning Question’ Reactions from within the cryptocurrency community meanwhile focussed on the broader implications of Shadow Brokers’ latest attack. Core developer Wladimir van der Laan wrote on Twitter “( finding) indication of tools for manipulation of banks/markets, more than spying” was now the “burning question.” So the burning question about #SWIFT #eqgrp leak: did anyone find indication of tools for manipulation of banks/markets, more than spying? — Wladimir (@orionwl) April 15, 2017 As the traditional financial system comes under increasing threat from cyber criminals, Bitcoin could emerge as the go-to method for storing wealth thanks to its decentralized blockchain and SHA 256 encryption, especially when compared to the ‘honeypot’ of banks’ centralized databases. Microsoft Back In Spying Spotlight The released data does not only focus on SWIFT, but also on Microsoft. Having been outed as involved in NSA spying activities by Wikileaks’ Vault 7 dump in March, the corporation this time is facing stolen code for compromising Windows, “ at least some of which still work.” In a responsorial statement, Microsoft protested ignorance. No official correspondence regarding the threat had been received. “Other than reporters, no individual or organization has contacted us in relation to the materials released by Shadow Brokers,” it told Reuters. Regarding the specifics of the SWIFT hack, it appears Dubai-headquartered service bureau Eastnets could be a major target. Like Microsoft, the SWIFT intermediary denied any malicious activity had occurred. “ The reports of an alleged hacker-compromised EastNets Service Bureau network is totally false and unfounded,” the BBC quotes a spokesperson as saying. “The EastNets Network Internal Security Unit has run a complete check of its servers and found no hacker compromise or any vulnerabilities.” NSA spying activities are claimed to have affected not just companies, but politicians and even everyday consumers. As part of Vault 7, WikiLeaks suggested end-user electronic devices such as smartphones and smart TVs could have become microphones for intelligence officers to listen in on. Even Donald Trump and his family may have fallen victim. What do you think about the Shadow Brokers’ latest claims? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Swift, Twitter, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	google-bitcoin-encryption-security	Google: It's 'More Urgent Than Ever' to Use Bitcoin's Encryption	2017-03-05T06:00	Google has said the world should stop using SHA-1 cryptographic hash function and move on to SHA-256 – the cryptography used in Bitcoin. Google: Move to SHA-256 ‘More Urgent Than Ever’ In a release late last month, the company said it had successfully achieved the “world’s first SHA-1 collision,” an experiment where two pieces of data share the same hash. The research was a joint project between Google researchers and the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. “ For the tech community, our findings emphasize the necessity of sunsetting SHA-1 usage… We hope our practical attack on SHA-1 will cement that the protocol should no longer be considered secure,” the project’s team writes. Moving forward, it’s more urgent than ever for security practitioners to migrate to safer cryptographic hashes such as SHA-256 and SHA-3. SHA-1 ‘Flaws’ Gift To Top Hackers Google has been stressing the need to abandon SHA-1 for several years, with software such as its Chrome browser and operating system among the first to see a decreased reliance on the technology, which is now twenty years old. The release specifically states that it is SHA-1’s “flaws” that contribute to the possibility for powerful hackers to undermine it. “In practice, collisions should never occur for secure hash functions. However, if the hash algorithm has some flaws, as SHA-1 does, a well-funded attacker can craft a collision. The attacker could then use this collision to deceive systems that rely on hashes into accepting a malicious file in place of its benign counterpart. For example, two insurance contracts with drastically different terms.” Despite SHA-1’s ability to be hacked, Bitcoin’s SHA-256 never has been. SHA1 has been broken. RIPEMD-160, used to protect #Bitcoin, might be too weak at also 160 bits. #SegWit supports 256-bit security. — Eric Lombrozo (@eric_lombrozo) February 27, 2017 Antonopoulos Says Bitcoin Can Fight Off Quantum Computers In a further reassuring speech for cryptocurrency users, Andreas Antonopoulos last week said that Bitcoin’s hash functions meant it was naturally immune to the most sophisticated attacks imaginable – those from quantum computers. Speaking in a Q&A session, Antonopoulos explained how Satoshi Nakamoto’s design meant that Bitcoin would continue to rise above advances in the field. At the same time, he acknowledged that while the US National Security Agency (NSA) may well have the quantum computing power to “hack” Bitcoin, it was extremely unlikely they would ever do so. “ It is certain that the NSA has already built quantum computers. Google has one in their data center, and if they have one, the NSA has one that’s ten times better,” he said. “…Do they use that to break Bitcoin? The simple answer is: no.” What do you think about Google’s perspective on SHA-1 and Bitcoin’s resilience to quantum attacks? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	gridcoin-pow-for-boinc	Gridcoin: POW for BOINC - Bitcoinist.com	2014-06-16T24:00	According to Gridcoins website It is estimated that the Bitcoin network is currently using in excess of 76,000MWh a day of electricity on hashing sha256 alone. What Gridcoin wants to do is taken even if it’s a little portion of that essentially wasted resources and put it towards distributed computing (BOINC) which would benefit a wide variety of fields of studies such as medicine, biology, climatology, mathematics, and astrophysics, just to name a few. It wants to benefit from the POW networks; it’s not changing the work. It’s simply repurposing what the work is doing. This allows the network’s BOINC contribution to scale properly with the POW network. In order to compensate for a variable network rate, it also has a variable block reward which halves every 4 years (840,000 blocks), ranging from 5 – 150 GRC for a total of 168 million GRC. Rewards are based on this formula: Rewards = ((User’s Individual Project RAC)/ (Individual project AVG RAC))*150 For reference RAC is the recent average credit one miner gets. The RAC is calculated by the average number of Cobblestones per day granted recently with this average decreasing by a factor every two weeks. A Cobblestone is the credit which BOINC measures how much computation you provide. A Cobblestone is measured to be 1/200 th day of CPU time on a reference computer that does 1,000 MFLOPS based on the Whetstone benchmark. Since it uses the scrypt algorithm, many come to the conclusion that it would like to remain CPU/GPU only. What I find interesting however, they state just the opposite. We wish for GPUs to contribute towards BOINC projects, so we do not take an anti-asic stance. I believe the reasoning behind this is because in terms of distributed computing projects, they don’t care where the computing power is coming from. All of it is going towards a good cause, and if you’re in it for the money (as a miner, commercially some may benefit from distributed computing) I don’t think you’d be looking here in the first place. If you are indeed in it for the money, Gridcoins website shows two fantastic examples on how you can do it. The first is to use BOINC for what they call “desktop Grid Computing”. In the first example, one would have a video rendering project, where they would charge the customer and pay proportionally amongst the contributors according to how computation they provided. The second example would be a BOINC DAC, or a decentralized autonomous corporation. What makes BOINC DAC’s different from other DACs (Noirshare, Peershares, etc.) is that even though profit is being made, anyone can contribute towards a DAC and get rewarded with GRC. I really hope that Gridcoin becomes a huge success, using computational power for the advancement of humanity as a whole is common sense, if only Satoshi had implemented it in when Bitcoin had been conceived. BOINC has already made plenty of success stories true, and now with the addition Gridcoin many more to come. For more info, see Gridcoins website.
bitcoinist	hackers-north-korea-attempt-steal-bitcoin	Hackers from North Korea Attempt to Steal Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2017-09-30T18:02	Hackers from North Korea have attempted to infiltrate several cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, and some entities are saying that this action should serve as a wake-up call. One can definitely say that the country of North Korea is not a highly desirable tourist destination. The ruling military dictatorship, currently under the control of Kim Jong-un, has kept the country isolated from the rest of the world for decades. While we sometimes laugh at the absurd news that the official North Korean news agency reports, such as finding unicorns and how Kim Jong-un excels at everything humanly possible, the reality is that North Korea is a dangerous state. It has kidnapped people off the beaches of Japan and sends assassins into South Korea. It’s recent intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing has led to severe UN sanctions, and its ongoing nuclear program is definitely worrisome. Hackers from North Korea have long been active in seeking to cause mischief, and their current targets are a number of Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea. North Korea Desperately Needs Money It should come as no surprise that North Korean hackers are looking to get their grubby mitts on some Bitcoin. CNBC recently reported on this nefarious activity. A report from FireEye states that hackers from North Korea (who are extremely likely to be agents of that rogue state) have targeted the personal email accounts of those working at various Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea using tax-themed lures and deploying malware. So far, three exchanges are known to have been targeted, and there is a possibility of four wallets being targeted on the Yapizon exchange as well. North Korea is desperate for funds. The UN sanctions have really hurt their already-fragile economy as the sanctions impacted a full third of their exports (such as coal, seafood, iron ore, and iron). However, such sanctions were only the beginning as the United States has put additional sanctions upon North Korea, to which Kim Jong-un has loudly railed against. This has led to even China’s central banks cutting off ties with North Korea so as to not fall under penalty of the US sanctions. In short, North Korea is looking at any possible way to gain funds, and it appears that trying to steal Bitcoin is one such method of getting needed capital. Is This a Wake-up Call? Of course, the news of hackers from North Korea looking to score some Bitcoin has led to the usual hyperventilating from news agencies. CNBC openly wondered if these attempted thefts were a wake-up call to finally get governments and financial agencies to begin regulating digital currencies. CNBC cited University of Georgia Professor Jeffrey Dorfman, who said: The ability of regimes like Kim Jong Un’s North Korea to mine or steal cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin is a new reason to be cautious in treating these commodities as currencies. While rogue states have practiced counterfeiting even longer than they have been computer hacking, counterfeiters are easier to catch. Once a cryptocurrency is stolen, it is virtually impossible to stop the new owner from spending it, and doing so in untraceable ways. Are Bitcoin and other digital currencies used for bad things? Of course they are. But you can say the same for gold, silver, hard currency, and so on. It’s not exactly earth-shattering to realize that bad people spend currency on bad things. However, it’s far harder to launder digital currency than the media and world governments would have you believe, as can be seen in the case in mid-July where $60 million of ether was pilfered. It would nice not to deal with all the hand-wringing whenever a bad person is associated with cryptocurrency. As for North Korea and Kim Jong-un, you can bet that they’ll continue to attempt to hack their way into different cryptocurrency exchanges. The US sanctions are not going away any time soon. What do you think about North Korean hackers targeting Bitcoin exchanges? Is this a wake-up call or not? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Wikimedia Commons and Flickr.
bitcoinist	hackers-steal-60-million-bitcoin-nicehash	Hackers Steal Over $75 Million in Bitcoin from NiceHash - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-07T14:30	Slovenia-based NiceHash, the cryptocurrency mining marketplace where users can rent their unused hashing power, announced on Wednesday that they had been hacked, resulting in a loss of funds estimated to be worth more than $75 million USD at current Bitcoin prices. Massive Security Breach The announcement, made via social media, indicated that NiceHash had suffered a massive security breach during which hackers were able to compromise the company’s payment system and steal the contents of both NiceHash’s wallet and – according to some reports – some customers’ wallets as well. At press time, NiceHash’s website remains closed for maintenance. The theft was confirmed by NiceHash in a Facebook post: Calamity as Millions Lost While NiceHash had not yet announced the total number of bitcoins stolen by the hackers at the time of the breach, company marketing executive NiceHash Andrej Škraba told Reuters that they had been the victim of “a highly professional” heist that yielded about 4,700 bitcoin, which at the time of the theft was valued at over $63 million. With Bitcoin prices continuing to climb, however, that total now stands at over $75 million based on Bitcoin’s current estimated value of more than $16,000. Needless to say, people aren’t happy. NiceHash operates as a company that pairs crypto miners with those who have spare computing power. Most of the company’s customers mine altcoins and then exchange them for bitcoins. While most withdraw their coins, quite a few leave them on NiceHash’s platform. As of now, NiceHash is recommending that their customers change their passwords. While not confirmed in any way to be related to the Bitcoin theft, information has surfaced on Reddit through user /u/YadaBadaDoo that NiceHash’s founder and CTO, Matjaz Skorjanc, is himself a convicted criminal, having been convicted in 2013 of having created the Mariposa botnet, assisting others in “wrongdoings” and money laundering. Articles published on BBC and Phys.org confirm the redditor’s findings. This is just but the latest in a string of high-profile hacking attempts in the crypto world. About $150 million in ETH was frozen due to a vulnerability in Parity’s wallet last month. Before that, around $30 million in ETH (now worth $62 million) was stolen from Parity in July. As cryptocurrency continues to rise in value, you can bet plenty of thieves and hackers are going to continue to steal what they can. Were you impacted by the theft of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet? What do you think about this latest theft? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of NiceHash, Pixabay
bitcoinist	happy-birthday-bitcoin-leading-cryptocurrency-turns-nine-today	Happy Birthday Bitcoin! Leading Cryptocurrency Turns Nine Today - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-03T16:00	The Bitcoin whitepaper was released back in 2008 by a person or group going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Today marks nine years since the Genesis block, the first block ever mined, was created. Happy Birthday! It’s been a long road, but the network is now nine years old. The first block, created by Bitcoin’s creator, was mined one January 3rd, 2009 at 6:15 PM UTC. When blocks are created, the miner who produces them can leave a message in the block. Most mining pools will simply state their name along with maybe support for a proposal currently on the table. Satoshi created Bitcoin amid the housing and real estate crash during the latter half of the last decade. The first block has this etched into it, for all time: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks -Satoshi Nakamoto This quote gives some serious insight surrounding the motives of the anonymous developer. Satoshi continued the project until 2010, when he handed over the role of Lead Maintainer to then-Core developer Gavin Andresen. After that, he disappeared from the community and has yet to be heard from since. Bitcoin Price Evolution 1 bitcoin first hit parity with the US dollar in February of 2011, and by the middle of the year, it was over $30. This price would not last forever, however, as by the end of the year it was back at just around $2. In April 2013, Bitcoin managed to top out at over $250 before crashing back down to under $100. Bitcoin’s price flirted with the quadruple-digit mark and finally surpassed it during the MtGOX crisis. MtGOX was an extremely popular Bitcoin exchange back in the day, responsible for more than half of the Bitcoin transaction on the network. It turned out that MtGOX was insolvent, and had a trade bot artificially pumping the price. The price crashed quickly and continued to go down for a while, bottoming out at $600. This event was followed by nearly a two-year bear market, with little to no price growth. It wasn’t until 2016 when the value started to pick up again, and by the end of the year, it was back over $1000. 2017 was one of the best years Bitcoin has every seen, starting at just around $1000 at the beginning of the year and it stopped for no one. It quickly soared to $2500, and even over $3000 before the correction. By December, Bitcoin was over $10,000. Some exchanges showed bitcoin prices over $20,000, but the current price sits just around $15,000. Bitcoin has a massive amount of momentum going for it right now, and 2018 is slated to be just as exciting. With technical upgrades that will revolutionize the network coming through the pipeline such as Lightning Network, along with traditional financial institutions starting to get into the market like the CME and CBOE futures markets, the next 12 months will be very interesting. Where do you see bitcoin going in 2018? Are we in for another multi-year bear market? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pexels
bitcoinist	hardware-wallet-ledger-keepkey-trezor	Battle of the Bitcoin Hardware Wallets: Trezor, KeepKey or Ledger Nano S? - Bitcoinist.com	2017-06-20T07:01	I’ve finally decided to check out the Trezor, the original Bitcoin hardware wallet, to see why it’s a favorite among cryptocurrency users and how it compares to its main rivals, namely the Ledger Nano S and KeepKey. Trezor: Nothing Beats the Original? The Trezor hardware wallet is a perennial favorite among Bitcoin and cryptocurrency users. Released a few years ago, it was the first of its kind, combining user-friendliness and advanced security in handling Bitcoin private keys. This device costs $99 USD and also supports Dash, Zcash and Ethereum. Simply put, it makes it possible to store as well as transact without exposing your private keys even on a compromised computer. I must admit, however, that in over three years in the Bitcoin space — which seem like eons— I have never even held the Trezor in my hands. I was first introduced to hardware wallets through the Ledger Nano S ($69) and the KeepKey ($99), which I review here. It’s safe to say that these devices are the ‘big three’ hardware wallets on the market today, which all work in a similar manner and only when plugged into your computer. Getting Set Up The Trezor comes in three colors, black, gray and white, and is made in the EU. My device was shipped from the Czech Republic. Even though the device itself feels very light in the hand, the build quality is solid with tactile buttons. Upon plugging in the USB cable, the device’s screen displays the link where you download the software component, namely the Chrome browser extension. In fact, the process was identical to its rivals where the device’s firmware is automatically updated upon setup. Following the onscreen directions, you’re then asked to enter and confirm your new PIN and write down the 24-word recovery seed (2 sheets included in the box). Next, replugging the device, the wallet interface is launched automatically from the wallet website. It’s also possible to launch the app from the app drawer on macOS. In whole, setting up the Trezor was extremely easy. I expect that the majority of grandmas would succeed. In fact, the hardest part was attaching the key ring onto the device, but this could simply be my fat fingers since I had similar problems with the Ledger Nano S and KeepKey as well :) How Do The ‘Big Three’ Differ? The main physical differences between the devices are the materials, screen size and form factor. The build quality is fairly similar between the Nano S and Trezor in terms of their plastic bodies. Though the latter does not have a protective metal cover. Admittedly, the KeepKey — with its single button — still feels like the more premium device among the three. In terms of size, the Trezor is similar to the Nano albeit the different shape and at about half the size of the larger KeepKey. The Trezor has the shortest micro-USB cord among the three. That said, the Trezor really shines on the software side. This didn’t come as a surprise though, since the team at Satoshi Labs had been around longer to constantly improve the user experience. Admittedly, the differences are again minimal since all use a Chrome extension app. However, what I really liked about the Trezor wallet are the little details such as the ability to not only choose the right transaction fee but also view the expected confirmation time – which is very clutch given the persistent network capacity issues. Even superficial details such as the ability to set a honey badger as the home screen or a custom image is a nice touch. I’m happy to report that my first transactions with the Trezor went through without any problems. It was appeared instantly in the interface and was confirmed in under two minutes (though the mempool was very small at the time). Decisions, Decisions The Ledger Nano S is the cheapest option out of the three. Then, there are the physical aspects, namely the form factor and materials. This should mainly depend on your individual preference and how you’ll use the device. Do you plan to travel a lot and carry the device with you at all times? Then I would probably go for the Ledger Nano S or the Trezor. Want a durable device? Then Nano. Are you an ardent proponent of open-source development? Go with the Trezor. Looking for a larger screen and a sleek design that won’t venture far from your desk? Then consider the KeepKey. For novice users, I would probably recommend either the Trezor or KeepKey. I found it a bit more difficult to update the firmware in the Ledger Nano S and pressing the two buttons simultaneously can be clumsy at times. Nevertheless, I don’t plan to ditch my Ledger Nano S anytime soon since I think its compact design, USB-stick-mimicking subtleness and protective metal cover are hard to beat. At the same time, I will definitely use my new Trezor as my backup Bitcoin hardware wallet and will report on any notable differences that I may find down the road. All in all, I recommend using any of these hardware devices over keeping your bitcoin on exchange or in a custodial wallet like Coinbase or Blockchain. These three devices all do a great job at what they’re intended for: handling your private keys and putting you in full control of your funds. Which hardware wallet would you prefer out of these three? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Trezor, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	healthheart-ceo-promise-blockchain-tech-decided-stop-complaining-work-improve-healthcare	HealthHeart CEO: ‘With the Promise of Blockchain Tech, I Decided to Stop Complaining and Work to Improve Healthcare’ - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-07T23:30	Bitcoinist sat down with HealthHeart CEO Mark Rudnitsky to discuss how his company is revolutionizing the way Electronic Health Records (EHR) are kept. Through storing EHR on the blockchain, with a development focus on health care providers themselves, HealthHeart aims to help make patient records both secure and flexible enough to meet the demands of the cutting edge developments being made in holistic healthcare. HealthHeart CEO Mark Rudnitsky Bitcoinist: What is your experience within the EHR industry? MR: I worked for Epic Systems Corp directly after getting my Master’s degree from Georgetown. While there, I was a member of the Chronicles database team, which was responsible for maintaining the integrity of the patient records we stored. I also worked closely with the Resolute Hospital Billing team and participated in several go-lives and upgrades for our customers. Bitcoinist: What made you decide to develop HealthHeart? MR: I wasn’t – and still am not – happy with the lack of security built into most EHRs. Epic’s security team was excellent, but when dealing with millions of lines of 40+ year old code, there’s only so much they could do. So many security vulnerabilities and bugs existed in critical code that I was shocked Epic wasn’t regularly sued for their part in breaches and data theft. Security through obscurity isn’t good enough when patients’ lives are on the line. With the promise of blockchain tech, I finally decided to stop complaining about it and actually work to improve healthcare. Bitcoinist: What are the biggest shortcomings with the current crop of traditional EHR offerings? MR: Security, like I mentioned above, is horrible throughout the industry. The deluge of news regarding patient data breaches and ransomware attacks makes that obvious. Beyond that, EHRs tend to be bloated, providing too much functionality, to the point where something as simple as printing a document can take 10 clicks. I remember that before a customer site visit, the customer liaison always made a point of reminding us to always teach customers about new shortcuts or ways to navigate through the software. That always struck me as odd – if your software was actually intuitive and easy to use, why did I keep having to keep re-teaching experienced users the most basic of functionality? Bitcoinist: How is HealthHeart different than traditional EHRs? MR: Besides the security benefits of the blockchain, we’ve made sure to engage medical professionals in the design and building of our software from day one. They have the final say in what workflows are most useful, what we should focus on in our next dev cycle, even what color we use on a given screen. This software is by them, for them. Other companies have medical teams, but never before has an EHR been built from the ground up with such input from real providers. Finally, our software is cheaper to implement by a wide margin, making it affordable for all but the smallest clinics. Bitcoinist: Is HealthHeart HIPAA-compliant? MR: Of course! There are certain features we’re building that aren’t, such as interacting with patients on social media of their choosing, but we’re actively working on ways to either make that data HIPAA compliant or to avoid any disclosure of sensitive information. Bitcoinist: How will HealthHeart benefit healthcare providers? MR: By making software that puts the provider first, we actively encourage providers to integrate our EHR seamlessly into their daily work. We’re not developing a product and saying “Hey, you need to use this as-is”, like certain other companies. It’s designed around their specific workflows. What they need is exactly where they need it, when they need it. That’s something that’s never been done on such a massive scale, before us. Bitcoinist: How will HealthHeart improve patient care? MR: If providers help design our software, it’s intuitive for them to use. They know it like the back of their hand, which means less errant clicks and mistakes. Providers don’t have to spend as much time learning software as before, which means there’s more time to take care of patients. The patient record is intact and immutable, so that means patients will never have part of their record go missing, or have incomplete histories. Behaviors that could harm patients, such as drug-seeking behavior, doctor shopping, and failure to abide by medical advice, are all noted in the blockchain and visible to providers so that appropriate steps can be taken to help them. Bitcoinist: You actively consult with an advisory board of healthcare providers – can you tell us more about that? MR: We’ve been engaging with practicing medical professional since the beginning. They steer the design of our software, telling us what works, what doesn’t, what’s missing, and other invaluable feedback. We show them everything – mock-ups and demos, papers and documentation. Nothing is hidden from them since the HealthHeart EHR is for them. We can’t improve without their feedback, so we try to be as transparent as possible and implement as many changes as they recommend. Bitcoinist: At a time when investors are looking for more than just a concept, will you be providing a working demo of the platform? MR: We hope to have a full working alpha build in the first half of 2018. Of course, development schedules being what they are, we can’t give a more specific time than that. We’ll actively be posting updates on social media, and hope to have at least a video demo online shortly. Bitcoinist: What future features/integrations are you planning for your platform? MR: Right now, we’ve seen a lot of interest from podiatrists, so we expect to work closely with podiatrists we know to build custom-tailored modules for podiatry work. Due to some feedback from an orthodontist we know, we also hope to spend time developing integrated 3D modeling functionality into our software. We’re even working on a module for smart tattoos! There’s a lot of functionality we want to build, so just keep following our project and we’ll make it public as we do it! Are you confident in your health provider’s record keeping? Would you be more confident if they were managed on the blockchain? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of HealthHeart, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	how-to-protect-yourself-from-common-bitcoin-scams	How to Protect Yourself from Common Bitcoin Scams - Bitcoinist.com	2017-10-26T11:00	The continuous growth of Bitcoin value over time has got a flip side. It has given rise to a whole new cybercrime economy revolving around various scams. Crafty threat actors zero in on unsuspecting victims in a bid to make them lose their Bitcoins in the long run. This article will shed light on today’ most common cryptocurrency-borne frauds so that you can tell the wheat from the chaff when performing Bitcoin-related transactions. Rogue Bitcoin Exchanges When you come across an ad on social media offering to let you purchase BTC for less than the market value, be advised this may well be a lure to make you visit a phony cryptocurrency exchange service. The first thing to check when you end up on any exchange site is whether it uses HTTPS protocol for a secure connection. If the URL starts with HTTPS, it means the communication between your browser and the service is encrypted and thus reliably secured. In case it’s HTTP, dealing with such an exchange is a slippery slope. Another classic giveaway of counterfeit exchanges is the PayPal to Bitcoin conversion trick. These websites typically provide a web form where you are supposed to enter your PayPal email along with the amount you would like to sell. Then, a QR code will appear to verify the transaction. However, you never actually get your Bitcoin, instead, you get your PayPal account hacked. Fake Bitcoin exchanges tend to come and go. They surface and vanish quickly, just to make a reappearance under the guise of a different domain name. Phony Bitcoin Wallets It’s somewhat harder to identify rogue Bitcoin wallets because the main function of wallets is to store Bitcoin rather than trade it. Therefore, these types of scams aren’t usually aimed at a direct financial gain. Instead, they most commonly try to dupe users into installing trojanized software bundled with a data-stealing component. This way, the perpetrators can pilfer sensitive information, such as your passwords. To distinguish genuine Bitcoin wallets from fake ones, stay on the lookout for various dubious hallmarks. Similarly to the rogue Bitcoin exchanges scenario, be sure to check if the wallet site uses HTTPS or tries to pass itself off as a well-known, legit Bitcoin wallet. Consider asking people you know and trust whether they have used the service before. In the event the Bitcoin wallet is an app you can download, it’s recommended to check it for malicious code first. Services like VirusTotal will come in handy as they allow you to scan any software binary for infections. Phishing Scams The objective of phishing, one of the most widespread scams out there, is to manipulate people into visiting a rogue site camouflaged as a reputable service. The swindlers will usually contact you via email or by means of a deceptive ad on the Internet. By going to their pseudo service you run the risk of catching viruses or losing your Bitcoin as a result of a bogus trade transaction. The indicators of a phishing scam can be quite subtle. The fake email may actually come from a cryptocurrency exchange or wallet service you have used. The cybercrooks might have obtained your contact details through a large-scale data breach, such as the notorious Yahoo! hack. The rule of thumb is to refrain from clicking on links embedded in an email. A phony hyperlink may appear real on the outside, but hovering over it will reveal a wrong URL. Another tip is to treat every email attachment with caution. Such malicious attachments also often bring ransomware that will encrypt your data and demand to pay the ransom. Scammers may also leverage web adverts so that you visit a fake Bitcoin exchange or wallet when looking up things like “Buy Bitcoin” or “Blockchain” on a search engine. Booby-trapped ads will typically appear at the top of search results. To steer clear of this hype, type website URLs directly in the browser rather than opt for sponsored content. Bitcoin Ponzi Scams Some sites offer cryptocurrency deals that look too good to be true. According to their claims, you can supposedly get the bang for your Bitcoin very quickly, for instance, double it overnight or something like that. This is a classic Ponzi scam. Once you submit your Bitcoin to the crooks, chances are you won’t even get the original amount back, not to mention that there will be no revenue at all. These sites tend to have referral programs where you can make some money through new customer leads. Therefore, a red flag to look out for is a referral link in URLs you may see on social media. An example of a referral link would be something like website.com/?ref=789. Cloud Mining Scams Cloud mining denotes a business model where people team up and invest their funds to rent Bitcoin mining hardware. Whereas this scheme per se is benign and completely legitimate, threat actors set up scams to lure interested parties and ultimately provide a lower return on investment than anticipated, or never carry through with their promises at all. To stay away from cloud mining shenanigans when you are up to this activity, pay attention to some potential indicators of risk. Again, do not trust sites that aren’t HTTPS. Avoid services promoted via referral links on social networks. Make sure the resource is transparent in terms of what pool is used for cloud mining, who runs it and how much profit you will get. A reputable service will typically also provide a dashboard where you can monitor all your mining operations in real time. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin Trading Risks Bitcoin theft can even go beyond the online realm. As the regulation of cryptocurrency trading operations is gearing up for a rise in some parts of the world, people may run into difficulties purchasing and selling Bitcoin the regular way. These hurdles have caused the Bitcoin economy to partially migrate underground and offline, where traders literally meet in person to complete exchanges. The newborn dark market is full of perils, though. Some of the recent heist incidents illustrate how dangerous peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading can get. In April 2017, a businessman from Delhi, India, got on robbers’ hook when trying to buy Bitcoin at a very appealing rate. He met with the purported traders at a mall. The impostors then abducted him and took $50,000 worth of local currency (Rupee) that he had prepped for the deal. Another newsmaking heist took place in New York in May 2017. A 28-year-old man posted an ad on Craigslist offering to sell $1,100 worth of Bitcoin and got a response from a potential buyer. Having met the supposed buyer in Brooklyn as arranged, the victim agreed to get in a car to complete the exchange. The robber and his armed accomplice then held him at gunpoint and coerced him to submit the cryptocurrency to their wallet. The takeaway from these ‘street cybercrime’ incidents is you should abstain from meeting strangers in person to trade Bitcoin, otherwise, you run the risk of being robbed the old school way.

bitcoinist	hypnotherapy-a-desperate-measure-for-bitcoin-investors-who-forgot-their-passwords	Hypnotherapy – A Desperate Measure for Bitcoin Investors Who Forgot their Passwords - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-21T01:30	Desperate Bitcoin investors who cannot remember their wallets’ passwords are turning to hypnotism to retrieve the forgotten information. Others are banking on technology and building supercomputers, but even that is not enough. Early Bitcoin investors who bought the cryptocurrency while it was still in its infancy stand to profit the most from its recent explosive gains. However, some investors have long since forgotten their wallet passwords, and some are on the verge of going crazy as they try to remember. Hypnotist to the Rescue Relief for some of the investors in this situation has come in the form of a hypnotist from South Carolina. Jason Miller claims to have developed techniques that enable his clients to recall deep and forgotten memories, according to his interview with The Wall Street Journal. However, his services come at a significant cost, considering Bitcoin’s current value. Jason Miller charges one Bitcoin in addition to 5% of the total amount recovered. Going by the current Bitcoin value, his services would cost at least $18,000. On the plus side, you don’t have to pay up if you don’t remember. Resetting is Not an Option If you lose your bank account password, all you needed to do to recover it is call your bank, answer a few questions, and have them reset the password. This is not the case with Bitcoin. Bitcoin wallets are secured with complex passwords and security keys that are designed to keep hackers out. Only the wallet’s owner knows the password, and there is no way to recover it – unless you are a really good hacker. This is just what one hacker has in mind. Mr. Philip Neumeier bought 15 bitcoins in 2013 for $260. His stash of Bitcoins is worth $300,000 today, but he has long forgotten his password. However, instead of visiting a hypnotist, Mr. Neumeier has decided to design a supercomputer that will crack his wallet open. The task is so demanding that the supercomputer sits in a 270-gallon tank of special mineral water to keep it cool. Even with his computer hacking away at the problem 24/7, Neumeier estimates that it will take about 300 years to get the work done – hopefully, it will all be worth it if Bitcoin continues growing in value. A Heartbreaking Case One case, in particular, is extraordinary. Mr. James Howells bought 7.500 Bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was still new, but he threw away the hard drive where he had stored them in 2013. The bitcoins would be worth over $126 million today, but locating the landfill where his hard drive currently sits awaiting recycling is like finding a needle in a haystack and no amount of hypnotherapy or hacking resources can help him recover it. What would you do if you forgot your Bitcoin wallet’s password? Would you bank your hopes on a hypnotist? Share your thoughts with us in the comments below!

bitcoinist	ico-era-meet-new-hype-blockchain-crypto-token-wars	ICO Era Is Over, Meet the New Hype on Blockchain — Crypto Token Wars! - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-08T18:00	Game studio Chatrobotic announces Fishbank, the upcoming PvP mmo based upon the Ethereum blockchain. After a number of stunning ICOs managed to collect millions of dollars gone to develop their products for years to come, it became quite obvious that the only practical implementation of blockchain technology at the moment is… a digital kitten collectibles game. If breeding and adoring cuties have resulted in congestion of the whole Ethereum network, it is hard even to predict what impact a full-featured blockchain game can make. The new kid on the block is the massively multiplayer online (MMO) game on smart contracts called “ Fishbank.” It represents quite aggressive PvP (player-versus-player) gameplay with open-sourced fighting mechanics and global leaderboards called the “food chain.” Every player owns a fish that is, in fact, a digital ERC-721 token stored on the Ethereum blockchain. It acts like any other cryptocurrency and can be transferred, gifted, or sold to other players. The core parameter of the fish token is the weight which defines its size and influence. Fish are able to gain weight by hunting others and taking bites off of losers. The main objective for a player is to increase the size of his fish in order to become the biggest fish in the “deep decentralized blue ocean.” As mentioned in the Fishbank Whitepaper, the more weight the fish has, the more value its token represents and the more Ether the owner may ask for it on the market. All fish tokens are divided into Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Three are three ways to obtain an original fish token: catch a random one in the Aquarium for a small fee, buy from other players on the Market, or be rewarded for helping the project spread the word. All settlements between players are made in Ether, and no special currency is involved. In order to play the game, the user must have a Chrome or Firefox browser installed with the MetaMask extension. Every game action that runs smart contracts requires gas to complete a transaction in the Ethereum network. The team behind Fishbank is a studio called “Chatrobotic,” who is famous for its chat bot game titles running on various messenger platforms (Telegram, Kik, and Facebook Messenger) with more than 500,000 players on board and 2.5 million messages sent daily. The game is still in development, but there is already a lot of hype around it — developers promise to launch the Alpha closer to the end of January 2018 with an ability to preorder your fish token prior to the event. No ICO will be conducted. One can agree that the emerging of dApps is an extremely important iteration for distributed ledger technology development, even being it in a form of a funny game. If that teaches players who are using digital crypto wallets, that is good for all.

bitcoinist	ico-lose-funds-ernst-young-report	ICO's Lose 10% of Funds to Criminals, New Ernst & Young Report Finds	2018-01-23T15:00	“More than 10%” of ICO funds fall into the hands of hackers and not investors, according to new research by Ernst & Young. ICO Risks – From Phishing To FOMO In a report published this week, in collaboration with Group IB, the professional services giant reviewed 372 ICOs and warned about what it views as the ICO market’s “big risks.” These include phishing, failure of organizers to meet stated goals and even so-called ‘FOMO’ (‘fear of missing out’) inflating demand. The findings come as the international trend towards ICOs as the crypto-based investment of choice wanes, organizers and contributors alike facing increased regulatory scrutiny and the need to prove the longer-term potential of their product or service before increasingly skeptical audiences. The susceptibility of funds raised through ICOs to go missing or otherwise disappear from circulation also remains a significant talking point after multiple successful hacks in 2017. In emailed comments on the findings, Positive.com Blockchain security expert Arseny Reutov wrote: ICOs provide a huge opportunity for scammers and attackers as they are essentially taking advantage of the promise of people making a huge return from relatively low investment. Unfortunately, this report shows the financial loss being inflicted is devastating when viewed at scale. Engadget Hackers steal almost $400 million from #cryptocurrency ICOs ZDNet PDF) by Ernst & Young, over 10 percent of all funds changing hands during these events have been lost or stolen. This equates to roughly $400 million in… https://t.co/cTTiuqcpu0 #Crypto #BitCoin pic.twitter.com/1TFgWPB2OE — Saeed Valadbaygi (@SaeedBaygi) January 23, 2018 ‘Linchpin Moment’ The ‘celebrity’ status of the ICO concept among mainstream consumers has only heightened the extent of criminal activity associated with token sales. In January, announcements that instant messenger service Telegram would seek to raise funds using the model saw a fake sale con unsuspecting would-be investors into handing over coins to malicious parties. The genuine ICO itself is still in planning. Adopting an admonitory tone, Reutov concludes: This could potentially be a linchpin moment for the future of ICOs – they could disappear as quickly as they emerged. If ICOs are to prove themselves as a viable fundraising option, they must address the issue of security urgently. What do you think about Ernst & Young’s ICO findings?

bitcoinist	icos-review-token-prices-in-line-with-cryptocurrency-growth	ICOs Review Token Prices in Line with Cryptocurrency Growth - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T22:30	After a period of continued growth, ETH and BTC prices have recently fluctuated significantly, with the bitcoin price peaking at over $19,783 on December 17, 2017, before falling to $14,129 on December 31, 2017, and then to its current value of approximately $10,654 (according to the CoinDesk BitCoin Price Index). Owing to sustained cryptocurrency growth in 2017, before the downward adjustment in January 2018, a number of ICOs have perceived a need to lower their token prices in a bid to stay ahead of the market. For example, SocialMedia.Market has announced plans to do just that, to attract potential new token holders and offer an upside to existing pre-ICO backers. The company has updated the hard cap for its project and set a more advantageous ETH exchange rate for Social Media Tokens (SMT). This step is also likely to increase interest in the ICO of the blockchain-based influencer marketing platform scheduled to start on February 9, 2018. The company developed the platform to bring together opinion leaders, bloggers, advertisers, and agents, providing them with a secure tool for the promotion of products or services, eliminating pricing uncertainties and enabling them to build transparent relations. According to a recent study from Mediakix, this is a market with vast potential going forward, with spending on advertising projected to rise from $1 billion today up to $10 billion in 2020. Users require the company’s utility tokens, the SMTs, to enjoy access to the full suite of services on the platform. And the earlier they get the tokens, the better, as SocialMedia.Market CEO and founder Dmitry Shyshov notes: “Agencies and major advertisers will be able to buy the tokens for less at the early development stage of the platform during the ICO, and will thereby leverage more favorable terms and conditions for advertising campaigns and other platform services.” And now there is even more incentive to acquire the tokens in the forthcoming ICO, with the exchange rate revised from 700 SMT to 2,500 SMT per ETH, and the hard cap reduced to 16,000 ETH. At the same time, Shуshov offered assurance that early pre-ICO backers would not lose out: We appreciate the support of our early baсkers, who joined us during the presale. Therefore, we have decided to provide them with additional tokens based on the updated exchange rate and the current state of the market. Tokens will be recalculated at an exchange rate of 3.75. So, every 1,000 tokens bought during presale will increase to 3,750 after the accommodations. After the ICO, the company plans to promote the platform by advertising with influencers, thereby demonstrating its overriding belief in the platform. It also plans to implement a global marketing program on the platform, to deliver influencer marketing training programs for bloggers, advertisers, and budding marketers, and to conclude partnership agreements with advertising agencies and popular bloggers. The company’s revised ICO token price and future plans were immediately backed by SocialMedia.Market’s technical, legal and marketing partner ICOBox, with its co-founder Nick Evdokimov commenting: The monumental growth in cryptocurrencies is posing unique challenges for the ICO market. To stay competitive, projects must keep a close eye on cryptocurrency prices. The step being taken by SocialMedia.Market is very timely, and speaks volumes about their insight and commitment. The beta version of SocialMedia.Market is scheduled to come out in early February, while the token sale will start on February 9, lasting until March 16, 2018. The company is also offering further incentives through an innovative referral program, whereby all participants can secure a 5% reward from all SMT acquired by their referrals via sharing their referral links with friends and followers. The referrals will also be eligible for a 3% bonus on the tokens they buy. The referral program will function until the completion of the token sale. For more information about SocialMedia.Market please visit their website and download the project whitepaper. Do you think that ICOs should recalculate their token prices based on market fluctuations? Is the 3.75 recalculation exchange rate a fair way to address early backers?

bitcoinist	india-zebpay-refutes-bitcoin-illegal	India: Zebpay Refutes Reports Minister Said Bitcoin Is Illegal	2017-03-29T14:30	India is the scene of conflicting reports over Bitcoin’s legality following suspicious statements from the government. Minister: Virtual Currencies Lack ‘Regulatory Approval’ On Tuesday, Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal said that use of virtual currencies “could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws.” On the creation of virtual currencies, the bank spokesman added that “No regulatory approval, registration or authorization is stated to have been obtained by the entities concerned for carrying on such activities.” While not explicitly stating that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin were therefore not legally sanctioned, reports suggested that such a message was implied. The local Bitcoin industry was quick to dispute such conclusions. Indian exchange Zebpay published a dedicated response to the episode in which it stated its belief that Bitcoin in India “is not illegal.” A blog post reads: Nothing has changed regarding bitcoin’s legal status in India this week. In our opinion, bitcoin is not illegal. Bitcoin is legal under all existing laws. It’s business as usual at all Indian bitcoin exchanges, including Zebpay. Nonetheless, a word of caution accompanied the rebuttal. “As per media reports, inter-ministerial committee has been setup to study the legality of bitcoins. They will give a response on 20th April 2017,” an update announced. Bad Actors Give A Bad Name Recent illicit use of Bitcoin by scam actors was widely reported in the media, with Zebpay commenting at the time that such parties posed a persistent problem to uneducated consumers. A forgiving perspective was also given to the minister, the exchange taking the stance that regulators were trying to “protect” the public. “A respectable MP raised the issue that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. Certain sections of the media reported this as if bitcoin has been declared illegal,” it summarized. Additionally, Bitcoin is considered a commodity and falls in the Neutral/Alegal bracket, according to information portal Coin.dance. India’s Bitcoin ecosystem had seen a surge in usage following the country’s sudden currency reforms introduced in November last year. Zebpay and fellow exchanges witnessed record trading, part of a wave of Bitcoin interest, which even saw the market become the second largest on Purse.io’s Amazon discount platform behind the US. Blockchain innovation is also active locally, with crypto investor Tim Draper in February announcing his return to the Indian market, injecting venture capital through the newly acquired Blume Ventures.

However, now that the crypto revolution is firmly upon us, ICOs have arrived to provide digital currency creators with an effective way to get the funds they need to follow their software development dreams. Traditional Crowdfunding Meets Decentralized ICOs According to Fortune, Indiegogo, an innovator in the crowdfunding world, will combine their experience in the industry with the increasingly popular, and lucrative, business of ICOs. The platform will do this by evaluating the actual ICO and also assist these start-ups in selling their customized currencies and tokens. Using ICOs to fund your new venture could be just what your business needs if it is successful. Since its inception, the ICO model has raised a combined total of $3.5 billion for new platforms, the bulk of which was actually raised in 2017 during the crypto industry’s most spectacular year yet. Even though traditional crowdfunding is still an option, ICOs can earn you so much more in a much shorter period of time. Depending on what you’re offering, you could raise millions of dollars in just a few days, or if you’re SingularityNET, in just a single minute. ICO-No for Some Investors However, because there is no framework or regulations attached to ICOs, some investors are wary of putting their money into it. Indiegogo hopes to change that. Slava Rubin, one of the platform’s co-founders, had this to say: We want to bring a brand of trust to the entire industry, which we think will bring ICOs to the mainstream. Indiegogo’s first project centered on another money puller, online gaming. In this case, in the form of a Fan Controlled Football League. The pre-sale was held last month and the platform surpassed their target of $5 million during the 10-day sale period. This does seem like a good way to lend a perceived air of legitimacy to ICOs to foster more interest and subsequent adoption. It is also a way for traditional crowdfunding platforms to evolve with the times by taking advantage of the lucrative benefits that ICOs have to offer. Do you think that ICOs are the next-generation crowdfunding models? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Business Insider, Indiegogo

bitcoinist	inside-bitcoins-comes-chicago	Inside Bitcoins Comes to Chicago - Bitcoinist.com	2015-06-12T15:00	Inside Bitcoins is excited to host its next bitcoin event on July 10-11 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. The 2-day event will take place at the Navy Pier and feature the most pertinent bitcoin topics. Some of the sessions will be on blockchain-based Startups, investing, security and risk mitigation, fintech innovation, Bitcoin for non-profits, and mobile payments. Also Read: Bitcoin Meetup Growth Around The World (April 20th – May 19th 2015) Perhaps one of the most exciting elements of Inside Bitcoins is the opportunity to be an audience to such amazing speakers. Among the scheduled speakers are Jim Blasko, Co-Founder of CryptoMarket; Connie Gallippi, Founder and Executive Director of the BitGive Foundation; Bobby Lee, CEO and Founder of BTC China; and Matthew Roszak, Founding Partner of Tally Capital. US and Beyond: Current Regulatory Examinations and Enforcement Actions July, 11 2015 Day 2 Another important topic featured at the event will be bitcoin regulation and compliance. This is a hot topic in the bitcoin community and it is especially important for startups entering the arena. In this session, a panel of experts will discuss recent events, trends, settlement agreements, tips for regulatory exam preparation, and political and legislative insights. The session will be moderated by Joe Ciccolo, Founder and President of BitAML. Joe Ciccolo is a leading expert on regulation and compliance for businesses and startups and is also a Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS), Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE), and Anti-Money Laundering Certified Associate (AMLCA). BitAML provides BSA/AML compliance services to digital currency startups. Why AML certifications Are Important for Bitcoin Companies Joe Ciccolo stresses the importance of AML certifications as they apply to digital currency companies: “Setting up an AML compliance program is a must for digital currency exchanges, BTMs and others. Building an AML program should begin on or even before Day 1. As we’ve seen in the recent enforcement action with Ripple Labs, the piecemeal building of one’s AML program over time is not acceptable to regulators. In fact, FInCEN Director Calvary has stated publicly on numerous occasions that digital currency businesses are MSBs and will be held to the same standard as legacy players.” Digital currency compliance services, such as BitAML, help startups build an AML program that’s right for their business. BitAML provides BSA/AML compliance services to digital currency startups. Joe states: “Regulators have been quick to spot “cut-and-paste” and DIY compliance programs, as have many trading and other community platforms. Unfortunately, some digital currency businesses have spent precious time writing and developing an AML program only to later find out they must have it professionally prepared. The value of our expertise and regulatory compliance education throughout the building process is invaluable.” This type of service, he says, saves businesses precious time, which can be used for growing and innovating, rather than figuring out regulation and compliance on their own. Inside Bitcoins Startup Competition As if Inside Bitcoins wasn’t already exciting enough, a startup competition will be held for startups and entrepreneurs to pitch their bitcoin business ideas and strategies. This event will take place on July 10, Day 2 of the event. A panel of judges will choose one winner who will be awarded $1000 dollars, a featured speaking slot for a future Inside Bitcoins conference, and a free consultation with an industry influencer. Interested startups should e-mail [email protected] Find out more on the Inside Bitcoins Chicago event or sign up here. Will you attend the Inside Bitcoins Chicago conference?

bitcoinist	inside-bitcoins-new-york-day-3-morning-noon	Inside Bitcoins New York Day 3: Morning and Noon - Bitcoinist.com	2015-04-29T21:01	Here is Bitcoinist’s day 3 coverage of the Inside Bitcoins New York conference! Also read: Inside Bitcoins New York Day 2: Afternoon and Evening Solving Real Business Problems with the Blockchain Peter Kirby, President of Factom, opened day 3 of Inside Bitcoins New York with his lecture on using blockchain technology to solve real business problems. Factom, Kirby’s blockchain project, builds on top of the Bitcoin blockchain — much like how many useful applications are built on top of the Internet. The projects first collaboration is with Healthnautica.com, which is working on a tool for HIPAA compliance. However, the transparency vs privacy remains a pressing issue, with the risk of these blockchain projects getting hacked increasing concern. Therefore, the main focus of this project is making sure that the records stored on the blockchain are tamper-proof. We Are to Act, Not be Acted Upon: How the Blockchain is Fueling the Personal Empowerment Movement Brian Nelson, Founder of BTC Launch and Bond Manager of Alpha Surety Brokerage, offered his views on what Bitcoin and the blockchain have to offer. Are we making our own descisions? Sometimes, it feels as if powerful institutions are making our choices for us. With the blockchain, people will be able to reclaim their autonomy by harnessing the information the blockchain is capable of providing. However, the big question is how Bitcoin will make it into the mainstream. According to Nelson, the key to mainstream success is the development of simple tools, self-empowerment, and education. How To Make Bitcoin Easy For Small Business The following session was led by Steven Michaels and Bryan Skarlatos. Michaels is the President of the Digital Currency Institute and Founding Member of the San Diego Bitcoin Association ; Skarlatos is a Partner at Kostelanetz & Fink, LLP. This session addressed the issue of making Bitcoin work for small businesses. The duo said that the key to having Bitcoin success is building local Bitcoin communities. Businesses should start and support local meetup groups, while also joining meetup groups for other local businesses. This type of community building will allow local companies to establish a consistent Bitcoin presence in the community that offers educational resources. Michaels and Skarlatos also spoke about Bitcoin taxes. The most important part of properly reporting your Bitcoin earnings is consistency. There are a number of options for reporting Bitcoin income, but businesses need to stick with one method. However, it is worth researching the various reporting methods so that businesses can choose the one that works best for them. As with any other taxable income, the best way to be compliant is to do adequate research and contact tax professionals. How Washington is Impacting the Digital Asset Industry Perianne Boring delivering her lecture The last lecture before lunch was delivered by Perianne Boring. She is the Founder and President of the world famous Chamber of Digital Commerce. Bitcoin is an agent of change that has the long-run potential to impact industry, government, and humanity as a whole. However, there are problems concerning Bitcoin regulation that will hinder Bitcoins short-run capacity for change. AML, QFAC, consumer protection, privacy, and cybersecurity all need to be addressed before Bitcoin can have a substantial impact on global commerce. Boring noted that these issues have elicited a lot of complaints about Bitcoin, and that the community needs to come together to address these problems and develop solutions.

bitcoinist	inside-bitcoins-ny-day-2-afternoon-evening	Inside Bitcoins New York Day 2: Afternoon and Evening - Bitcoinist.com	2015-04-29T04:29	Here is Bitcoinist’s coverage of the afternoon and evening sessions of the Inside Bitcoins day 2 coverage! Also read: Inside Bitcoins NYC Presentation Day 1 (Morning till Noon) DigitalFX: A New Asset Class for Investors After the lunch break, Brian Kelly, contributor for CNBC’s Fast Money, Founder and Managing Member of Brian Kelly Capital LLC, and author of The Bitcoin Big Bang, took take the stage to talk about investing in Bitcoin and start-ups in the Bitcoin world. According to Kelly, Bitcoin is a payment system, a method for transferring value and information, and a tool for clearing and settlement. However, Kelley also believes that Bitcoin’s potentials extend far beyond its use as a currency. At its core, Bitcoin depends on the blockchain technology, which is capable of of much more than facilitating monetary transactions. The blockchain can enable businesses and organizations eliminate middle men, potentially allowing them to streamline business and make commerce more efficient. According to Kelley, Bitcoin’s birth happened in the right time and place. When Bitcoin was created, the world faced Economic upheaval, mistrust in the banking system, and demand from the Millennial generation for a different way of banking. Bitcoin, in the midst of these societal changes, offered the establishment of an entirely new financial sector. Additionally, the advent of Bitcoin offered a new asset class, an innovation resembling the rise of foreign currency trading in the 1970s. Industrial Mining: Powered Warehouse Shell vs. Hosted Cloud Offerings The next session was a panel that looked at industrial Bitcoin mining. The panel consisted of: Guy Corem CEO and Co-Founder, Spondoolies-Tech Juan Garavaglia CEO, 112 BIT LLC Francois Poupard Chief Editor, BitcoinVOX Marco Streng CEO and Co-Founder, Genesis Mining Jihan Wu Co-Founder, BitMain David A. Johnston Co-Founder, BitAngels and Managing Director, Decentralized Application Fund (Moderator) One of the things discussed in this panel is the issue of whether or not Bitcoiners should buy directly from miners or from the market. The argument in favor of buying from miners maintained that large purchases on the market create disruptive fluctuations in Bitcoin’s purchasing power. On the other hand, buying directly from miners would likely allow the market to avoid enduring those purchasing power fluctuations. Furthermore, buying from miners creates the possibility of getting a better deal on Bitcoin. The panel also discussed a problem of cloud mining. There are currently no validation systems implemented in the cloud mining industry, creating a large risk of fraud. According to panel speakers, this potential for fraud was responsible for the various Ponzi scheme’s uncovered in the cloud mining market. The panel advised that the best way to validate a firm’s validity is to ask for a tour of its facilities. Firms with hidden operators or facilities should be treated as a red flag. The Economic Impact of the Blockchain on Institutional Investors The next panel talked about Bitcoin as an investment. The members of this panel consisted of: Daniel H. Gallancy CEO and Founding Member, SolidX Partners David Namdar Partner and Head of Trading, SolidX Partners Garrett Nenner Managing Director, Rosenblatt Securities Michael Casey Senior Columnist, The Wall Street Journal (Moderator) One of the main points that came from this discussion was that investors can look at the underlying value of Bitcoin and its current price in several ways. to look at the underlying value and the current price. Consensus and scarcity play a huge role in determining the health of Bitcoin from an investment perspective. Additionally, the important thing to focus on when investing in Bitcoin is not the tokens themselves, but the blockchain and the state of the ecosystem surrounding Bitcoin. It is essential that the ideas for potential applications of the Bitcoin technology actually come to fruition; if the ideas never develop beyond the brainstorming stage, then the ecosystem will not grow and Bitcoin will not be a strong investment. However, this development is a slow process, and investors should take that fact into consideration when deciding on whether or not to buy into Bitcoin. In order for Bitcoin to get the attention of the institutional investment community, it needs to adopt a proof of identity system. A legitimate identity is essential to insitutional investors, because confirming an identity provides a level of certainty that a project can be trusted to handle an investment properly. The Fight to Gain Mainstream Acceptance This panel discussed the acceptance of Bitcoin by the general public. Bitcoin currently has a bad reputation that it needs to shed in order to achieve mainstream adoption. Furthermore, how many people in the mainstream actually know about Bitcoin? The panel explored the possibilities: Rob Cox: Global Editor in Chief, Reuters Breakingviews Grant Fondo: Partner, Securities Litigation and White Collar Defense Group, Privacy and Data Security Practice, Goodwin Procter LLP Juan Llanos:EVP of Strategic Partnerships & Chief Transparency Officer, Bitreserve.org Ted Rogers:Chief Strategy Officer, Xapo Bitcoin is maturing partly thanks to the number of lawyers entering the digital currency space. As Bitcoin grows in popularity and continues to gain attention from regulators, lawyers will play a crucial role in representing the Bitcoin technology and its community, and ensuring that proper legislation is adopted. After MtGox the exchanges changed their work methods and improves the security. However there are benefits from legislative and regulatory guidelines. There has to be some kind of collaboration of every partners out there. However this step might destroy the libertarian Bitcoin. IT is one of those path dependent choices unless the regulation solely on exchanges. Emerging Issues in Regulatory Compliance and Law Enforcement Efforts This is another great panel that covered recent developments in regulatory compliance and legislative actions concerning digital currency. The panel consisted of the following speakers: Jose Caldera VP of Marketing & Product, IdentityMind Global Angus Champion de Crespigny Senior Manager, Financial Services Office, Ernst & Young LLP Brian Klein Partner, Baker Marquart LLP Sarah Martin CEO, Boone Martin Amor Sexton Digital Currency Lawyer, Adroit Lawyer Marco Santori Attorney, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman (Moderator) B ig banks are becoming a little more comfortable with Bitcoin from a compliance standpoint, with some big banks making substantial investments in Coinbase. However, complete Bitcoin acceptance from the banking industry will take some time, as the market looks to governments to make regulatory decisions regarding Bitcoin. Regulatory clarity will make it easier for Bitcoin companies to become compliant, which in reduces the risks banks face when investing in a Bitcoin project. Start-Up Spitfire Session After the panel concerning regulatory and legislative actions, the “spitfire” session allowed start-ups 5 minutes each to introduce themselves and the goals of their projects. The following companies participated in this session: Peter Alexander: CEO and Founder, ProDataLab. Jay Berg: Founder, Satoshi Fantasy. Luke Brown: Management Consultant, Growthink. David Miller: Founder, Leverage Holdings. Will O’Brien: Technology Entrepreneur, Angel Investor, and Crypto Currency Executive. Brock Pierce: Founder and Managing Partner, Blockchain Capital. Paul Puey: CEO and Co-Founder, Airbitz. Allen Scott: Chief Editor, CoinTelegraph. Michael Terpin: Chairman, BitAngels, Partner, AngelList Bitcoin Syndicate and CEO, Transform Group Steve Waterhouse: Partner, Pantera Capital. Bitcoin 2.0 and Blockchain Startups: What Really Matters? The next panel focused on the start-ups that are working towards linking the blockchain to other new technologies, such as smart contracts. The panel consisted of: Jonathan Chester Founder and COO, Bitwage Reggie Middleton Founder & CEO, Veritaseum Michael Perklin President, CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4) and Director, Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. Micah Winkelspecht CEO and Founder, Gem. Rik Willard Co-Founder & CEO, MintCombine (Moderator) Security is one of the main things that the panel hopes to see with Bitcoin 2.0 projects. Everyone claims they have state of the art security, but how do you measure that? According to the panel, the Bitcoin industry needs strong security standards so Bitcoin companies and projects can generate trust with their customers and society in general. Can the blockchain technology actually be applied to these new innovations? Should everything be decentralized? Regardless of the ideal answer to the latter question, the blockchain will not be successfully integrated into every new innovation. Therefore, pockets of centralization will still exist, and the question of whether or not the blockchain can be implemented should be answered on a case-by-case basis.. The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and Digital Money Are Challenging the Global Economic Order This keynote address was delivered by Michael Casey and Paul Vigna from The Wall Street Journal. These two speakers addressed “the age of cryptocurrency.” What made cryptocurrency so important? How did cryptocurrency become a force for innovation? According to Casey and Vigna, the core of cryptocurrency’s power lies in the blockchain. Cryptocurrency provided an alternative means of transacting right in the middle of the devastating financial crisis of 2008. The unprecedented abilities of cryptocurrency generated a huge amount of interest, leading many people to believe that cryptocurrency would change the world. Consequently, Bitcoin and the blockchain technology have developed a cultural movement that continues to grow as Bitcoin progresses. In the middle of the crisis, 2008-2009, there is an alternative. It takes off and people believed they are going to change the world. So a cultural movement is growing around the Bitcoin and blockchain technology.

bitcoinist	inside-bitcoins-nyc-presenation-day-1-morning-till-noon	Inside Bitcoins NYC Presenation Day 1 (morning till noon) - Bitcoinist.com	2015-04-28T21:45	Bitcoin: The Final Piece of the Protocol Puzzle. Bitcoin is VoIP, Bitcoin is TCP/IP, Bitcoin is anything, and Bitcoin is everything. The second day of the Inside Bitcoins Conference in NYC was phenomenal. Inside Bitcoins NYC Keynote The first session of the second day of Inside Bitcoins NYC was kicked off by keynote speaker Mr. Dan Morehead. Morehead is Founder and CEO of Pantera Capital Management. He created Pantera Capital Management in 2003. In his keynote speech, Morehead touched on the general development of the Bitcoin industry and perceptions of such. The oft-quoted comparisons between Bitcoin and the Internet are not entirely correct; rather, Bitcoin complements the internet. Bitcoin is the next link and the price feed. Everything is on the rise, except that we talk about it. Mobile money is on the rise: in Kenya, 45% of the GDP is mobile money. Why is that? It is all about cross-border flows of this money. We have all heard about the promise of Bitcoin for remittances, we will be able to do away with the fees charged by Western Union all around the world soon enough. Morehead laid out different phases that Bitcoin will attain. Bitcoin is progressing in phases: – decentralised BTC buying and investing in Bitcoin, infrastructure (startups, etc.), – creation of new use cases; for example, micropayments and companies like change tip bitpesa and others, – non-financial blockchain applications – the disruption of payment monopolies and oligopolies. The next session was a panel that consisted of 6 people, plus the moderator. This panel, which was a gathering of quite influential and successful businesses and representatives in the crypto community, spoke about successes and failures in their past. The panelists were: o Rodolfo Andragnes: Founder, Argentinian Bitcoin Foundation and Co-Founder, Global Bitcoin Alliance o Joel Cano: Seasoned Executive, Entrepreneur and Angel Investor o Peter C. Earle: Chief Economist, Humint o Connie Gallippi: Founder and Executive Director, BitGive Foundation o Nimrod Lehavi: Founder & CEO, Simplex and Board Member, Israeli Bitcoin Association o Steven Michaels: President, Digital Currency Institute and Founding Member, San Diego Bitcoin Association (Moderator) When asked why they were interested in Bitcoin, the panelists responded varyingly. Joel Cano emphasized that “we are looking for a pragmatic currency.” Peter C. Earle described Bitcoin as both disruptive and innovative, stressing that education would play a large role in furthering the cause. Connie Gallippi saw the potential for non-profits and new avenues of funding for charitable causes through Bitcoin. Her work with BitGive has helped many, especially in developing countries. Nimrod, as a coder, found the coding of Bitcoin elegant; Andranges, on the other hand, found Bitcoin it mind blowing and a better currency in principle. Bitcoin Startups The next session was also a panel focusing on the possibilities of Bitcoin today. What is currently a good business model and why is that? What Bitcoin startups are there and what are they doing? The panel consisted of: o Christopher Hopkins: Partner, Akerman LLP o Joey Krug: Lead Developer, Augur o Justin Newton: Founder and CEO, Netki o Brock Pierce: Founder and Managing Partner, Blockchain Capital o Houman B. Shadab: Professor of Law, New York Law School o Vadim Telyatnikov: CEO, AlphaPoint o Eddy Travia: Co-Founder & Chief Startup Officer, Seedcoin (Moderator) Crowdfunding, especially distributed crowdfunding, is undeniably exciting. A decentralised system is the best way to maintain objectivity and a free market. One example of a Bitcoin startup is a Bitcoin exchange, of which many countries have new ones. One issue faced by new Bitcoin exchanges, and Bitcoin companies in general, is that regulations are often still hazy. Looking to the future of the blockchain and its incorporation in everyday life makes many entrepreneurs happy. The IP, smart contracts, etc that will happen on the blockchain will change the world. Trends in Bitcoin’s Competitiveness. In this session, Mr. Jaron Lukasiewicz, Chief Executive Officer at Coinsetter, focused on staying competitive in the Bitcoin space. He talked about credit cards and Bitcoin, and how superior technology will eventually rise to the top like cream. The more use cases, the price will also go up. As mentioned by other panelists, one of these applications is remittances. Western Union currently has a consumer friendly (step by step process). Bitcoin is quite difficult to understand and the inherent price volatility also scares newcomers away. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Foundation In the next session, the new Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Bruce Fenton, took the stage. He explained the current situation and what he intends to do to remedy said situation. Can a centralised company even help a decentralised product like Bitcoin? Fenton admitted that transparency is one of the main points that needs to be addressed. There are new steps being taken place that will be soon presented to members. How to Stop Bitcoin Theft: Multi-Signature Wallets Make Bitcoin Secure and Useful for New Industries After Fenton’s session, the microphone was passed to Ben Davenport, CTO & Co-Founder of BitGo. He is one who sees that businesses and everyone in the crypto industry are quite vulnerable. This vulnerability is largely due to the lack of the multi-sig Bitcoin wallets, according to Mr. Davenport. Multi-sig is best way to get a way to secure and eliminate single points of failure. There are inherent risks in holding keys yourself or trusting another party to hold it for you. If the owner holds key, he or she needs to watch out for malware, forgotten passwords, data loss, coercion, weak passwords, etc. If a service holds the key, the owner should be worried about employer’s negligence, hacks, insider theft, fractional reserves, government seizures, frozen funds, etc. However, by combining both owner and service key ownership, we are better protected. Cold storage and multi-sig are best together. Bitcoin in the Enterprise This next session focused on the blockchain-esque technologies and what benefit they could offer to large enterprises. John Velissarios, who is Co-Founder, Professional Services & CISO, Armory Enterprise Security LLP, spoke to us about these possibilities. For example a game company might wonder: How do you develop a secure development lifecycle? Blockchain-esque technology could help there. Hardware is important as they provide us the possibility of using physical keys. However, they are quite rigid. On the bitcoin side, there are a lot of devices out there but the focus is currently more on functionality than on security. Velissarios concluded that the area of enterprise Bitcoin security and blockchain security/use still has lots of room for improvement. “Inside Bitcoins 2029:” A Historic Look at 20 Years of Global Digital Currency Payments. In this session, Steve Beauregard, CEO & Founder of GoCoin.com, took us for a glimpse at his vision of the future of Bitcoin. He extrapolated on the Millennials’ huge distrust of established banks and asked where would their money go? Will Bitcoin even be the most prominent digital currency then? Is it reasonable to assume that there will be other coins that may come out that will be better, superior, or faster and maybe more secure than Bitcoin? Biometric technology and other wearable devices will definitely be a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. All that data will be collected and stored. Who knows what could happen in the future. Bitcoin Investing: Do’s and Dont’s The last session for the day sesion was by and for Bitcoin investors. The panelists in the session were: o Gil Luria: Managing Director, Wedbush Securities o Brendan O’Connor: Chief Executive Officer, Genesis Trading o Matthew Roszak: Founding Partner, Tally Capital o Tone Vays: Head of Research, Brave New Coin o Paul Veradittakit: Vice President, Pantera Capital o Harry Yeh: Managing Partner, Binary Financial o Michael Terpin: Chairman, BitAngels, Partner, AngelList Bitcoin Syndicate and CEO, Transform Group (Moderator) They all agree that Bitcoin is the greatest innovation in the last 50 years. Bitcoin is a long term investment for most of these panelists, and most of the readers as well. However, investing in companies for the infrastructure is also desired. Bitcoin is progressing through its phases right on schedule. If these conferences are any sign of the future, the world is growing person by person as Bitcoin knowledge spreads.

bitcoinist	inside-bitcoins-san-diego-bitwage-founder-jonathan-chester-speaks	Inside Bitcoins San Diego: Bitwage Founder Jonathan Chester Speaks	2015-09-11T08:00	Today, we have an interview with the founder of Bitwage, a company that aims to pay workers with bitcoin that in turn pay bitwage through wire transfers. The instructions are fairly straight-forward. Bitwage will send you a bank number, you tell your employer to wire transfer your paycheck to said bank number and voila, bitwage will then pay you in bitcoins. Also read: Inside Bitcoins San Diego: Digital Currency Institute’s Steven Michaels Speaks What is Bitwage? “Bitwage is the largest bitcoin payroll provider in terms of users and volume. We make it incredibly easy for anyone to send and receive wages in bitcoin. We offer three main solutions, payroll individual, payroll employer and international payroll. Payroll individual allows anyone, regardless of their employer signing up, to receive their wages in bitcoin. Payroll employer allows employers to offer the benefit of paying employees in bitcoin. International payroll enables this system to pay employees all around the world by leveraging bitcoin as a payment rail, saving employers, employees and freelancers 90% or more on international wage payments while making the entire process feel like they are using their everyday local currency.” What are the benefits to using Bitwage to receive your payroll? “ It costs 8% on average to send funds from one country to another, it often takes up to 5 business days for the funds to arrive, and in the meantime, no one knows where the funds are. Bitwage is building the future of international payments and we are starting with one of the most important pillars of todays society. The representation of your time & creativity. Your wage. Instead of payments moving through a series of 6, 7 or even 8 intermediaries, with each financial institution taking a fee, delaying the transaction, and increasing the risk of your funds getting lost, we move your funds internationally through the blockchain. The blockchain is a new, revolutionary technology that has opportunity to change the entire financial industry like the internet did with the telecommunication and publishing industries. With just the click of a button, funds can be sent instantly anywhere around the world, nearly for free. No intermediaries at all, so you always know where your funds are. The problem with the blockchain is how to get local currencies onto and off of this new payment rail. Bitwage takes this amazing technology and allows you to have all the same benefits of the blockchain, while allowing you to send and receive the currencies you use in your everyday life through our bank to bank, cloud savings and debit card solutions.” Which countries prevent the use of Bitwage? “It all has to do with the funds flow. The case of argentina is a great one. Because of the way their current system works, it costs between 30% and 40% of a payment to send the payment to Argentina. This mainly has to do with the difference between an official exchange rate and the actual exchange rate. All transfers of money from USD to ARP originating outside of the country must go through the state at some point and must be converted at the official exchange rate. However, Bitcoins are not considered money according to the Argentine government. This means that you can pay someone in bitcoin and then they can later “bring” that bitcoin from the US to Argentina and then convert locally at the local exchange rate. So, in this instance, it is not legal for us to send payments directly as USD to ARP with bitcoin as the rails, but it is legal for us to pay the employees in Bitcoin and for us to make it easy and convenient for them to convert at the local exchange rate. We currently have freelancers doing this in conjunction with our cloud savings solution, which allows you to hold your funds in the value of 20 different currencies and precious metals, including USD and Gold, and then paying out bitcoins into ARP from this account as needed.” How is Bitwage trying to revolutionize the current payment system? “Imagine, being able to pay your employees in Philippines, Russia and Argentina as cheap and easy as sending a text message and later that day the Philippine employee comes home with the soccer jersey his son always wanted, purchased with the extra funds he received. At Bitwage, we are seeking to build a system that provides an alternative to the current banking systems and payment rails. It is all about connecting people to financial freedom. Not only does our system provide the most seamless and automated way of bringing the 2.5bn unbanked aroundthe world into the digital financial systems, we are providing employers, employees and freelancers all around the world the ability to remove themselves from the grasps of the slow, costly and inefficient international foreign exchange oligopoly. ” What lies ahead in the future of Bitwage? “We are the only company specialized in payroll payments leveraging bitcoin. This means we have more privacy features, the ability to pay out in local currency, the ability to hold your funds in cloud accounts in the value of 20 different currencies and precious metals, debit cards, a seamless mass payment system, the ability to receive wages and benefits without your employer signing up, and the best bitcoin payroll api.” Bitcoin’s role in our society has been in upward movement since its creation. Consumer use, rather than price, is the most important when considering Bitcoin’s viability in the real world.

bitcoinist	inside-bitcoins-san-diego-digital-currency-institutes-steven-michaels-speaks	Inside Bitcoins San Diego: Digital Currency Institute's Steven Michaels Speaks	2015-09-09T24:00	The Inside Bitcoins conference in San Diego will be held from December 14 to the 16 of this year. The conference has been covered by Bitcoinist in many states such as New York, and this is the beginning of many interviews with the speakers that will be attending the conference. Today, we have Steven Michaels, the founder of the Digital Currency Institute, an educational and certification service founded to help individuals better understand the benefits of Bitcoin and related currencies. It needs no introduction due to the popularity of its certification program which would make you a certified bitcoin consultant by its standards. Without further ado, the interview Also read: Hackers Steal Record Number of Apple Accounts With iOS Malware What role do you want the Digital Currency Institute to attain in bitcoin related circles? “I want DCI to be known for its support and training of the cypherpunk ideals – primarily the idea of sound money that empowers mutual, voluntary exchange while being resistant to third-party interference. Our instructional focus is on: 1. Wallet security best practices 2. Economics of Bitcoin 3. Familiarity with the tools that make using Bitcoin easier while preserving or enhancing its privacy and censorship resistant nature.” What are your thoughts on Bitcoin XT ? Do you plan to address it at the conference? “I’m not a computer scientist but I do have a good understanding of economics. From that perspective, the most important features of Bitcoin, in my view, are 1) Its potential to act as a long-term store of value; 2) Privacy; and 3) its ability to act as a tool for self-defense against tyranny.” “I’m not a fan of XT Coin personally but I’m glad it was released because it has forced the public debate on many levels. It is also a “stress test” for Bitcoin itself. At any rate, it looks like Bitcoin is working like it is supposed to. Consensus is hard and it should be extremely difficult to make changes to the core protocol. Ultimately, the market always decides and I think it is making the right choice at the moment by rejecting XT Coin in its original form.” How much time have you been aware of bitcoin. Consequently, working with it? “I was first introduced to Bitcoin in January of 2011 but I didn’t really take noticeuntil the June, 2011 article in Gawker Magazine which was a story on The Silk Road. When I learned that a persecuted minority of the population could trade freely usingthis amazing new currency I immediately saw its potential for enhancing individual liberty. It is truly revolutionary. I’ve been hooked and involved full time ever since.” What are your thoughts on Bitlicense ? “I am against violence in every form. All licensing is simply the use of violence by some people to restrict the lives of other people. Licensing – and most laws – are the act of committing an immediate and certain crime (restricting voluntary association) with the hopes of stopping a possible, future crime. Licensing is anti-human and anti-life at its core. Committing an immediate crime to hopefully prevent a future crime is unacceptable in a free society.” What do you hope to achieve at the upcoming Inside Bitcoins conference? “My goal is to always promote tools that can maximize individual liberty and provide for self-defense against tyranny. Bitcoin is one of these tools if used properly and I hope to convey this message to all who care to listen.” Consider the pros and cons of using Bitcoin. Which pro outweighs most of the cons? “Without a doubt it would be its potential to act as a long-term store of value. Capital always flows to where it is respected and protected. Bitcoin protects capital because bitcoin is in limited in supply, it is relatively easy to protect, and it is useful in trade. Capital (property) is the product of our life energy. Capital is the fruit of our labor. Capital is life. Bitcoin is life. If you value your life you should pay attention to Bitcoin.” Bitcoin conferences open the door for speakers to express their ideas regarding a certain subject or to propose new ideas that have yet to be explored by bitcoin companies. Most importantly, receiving insight into a speaker’s mind helps you understand how their mind operates in respect to their ideals, morals, innovation. We have not explored the full capacity of the blockchain which leads me to believe that the exploitation of its innovation is just a matter of time. I love interviewing speakers as I can understand their mindset on bitcoin and Michael was able to transmit it to me through a few questions. I will see you on the next Inside Bitcoins San Diego interview. Will you be attending the Inside Bitcoins Conference? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	insurance-companies-blame-bitcoin-for-ransomware-increase	Insurance Companies Blame Bitcoin for Ransomware Increase - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-23T09:00	Insurance companies, such as Chubb, are making a ransomware Bitcoin correlation, saying that the cryptocurrency’s rising price is leading to more ransomware attacks. Few things are as aggravating as having to pay a criminal ransom in order to gain access to your own files. Ransomware attacks have targeted everything from major corporations down to a local transit authority, and they’re increasing in frequency. Some of the insurance companies who have to deal with the fallout of such attacks are making a ransomware Bitcoin connection, saying that the rising number of such attacks is the cryptocurrency’s fault. Blaming Bitcoin In an interview with Bloomberg, three insurance companies laid the blame for an increase in ransomware claims upon Bitcoin’s shoulders. One such company is Zurich-based Chubb, and one of their executive vice presidents, Michael Tanenbaum, said that it’s the increased value of the cryptocurrency that is driving hackers to strike more often. Tanenbaum says 2017 has seen a “massive escalation” in both the number of ransomware attacks and the amount of payments made in bitcoins. As insurance companies are on the hook (as long as the company has such a policy), they keep a keen eye on how much such hacking costs them. How big are the payouts becoming for insurance companies? The largest claim before 2017 was $17,000. That amount is pocket change as Tanenbaum says that, around midyear, the top payouts for ransomware attacks on corporations went over $1 million. That’s quite a jump. Hackers Becoming More Emboldened Two other ransomware specialists, Kivu Consulting and Navigant Consulting, agree with Chubb over Bitcoin and the increasing ransomware attacks. They note that the frenzy surrounding the increasing value of Bitcoin has emboldened hackers. Winston Krone of Kivu Consulting notes that ransom demands from $250,000 to $500,000 are now a weekly occurrence but were totally nonexistent six months ago. An executive at Beazley Plc, Kimberly Horn, says that ransomware claims at the company are up a staggering 70% this year. She adds: Because the price of bitcoin has seen a dramatic spike in the latter half of 2017, it has made the overall price of demands much larger. It may be true that there is a ransomware Bitcoin correlation. Criminals love the anonymity of cryptocurrency, but just because bitcoins are worth more doesn’t necessarily mean that more attacks are going to be made. If a hacker wanted a higher payout for their crime, they could always ask for a higher ransom. However, the instantaneous and anonymous nature of using Bitcoin can be a component of the increased attacks. Having to deal with wire transfers and other means of ransom payments could get complicated. Having a sum of virtual currency sent to a wallet address is so much easier. Then there’s the fact that success breeds imitation. Companies were quite willing to pay ransomware demands, especially if the demands were not too high, as it was cheaper than fighting back. Acquiescing to criminals always ensures that more criminals will line up to rob you. Another factor in increased attacks and payment demands is ease. With just some malicious code and the click of a mouse button, an attack can be unleashed anywhere in the world, and the hackers can range from single individuals to rogue states, such as North Korea. In the end, as long as there’s money to be made from a ransomware attack, they’re going to keep on happening. Do you think that there’s a ransomware Bitcoin price correlation?

bitcoinist	internal-revenue-service-irs-asked-provide-clearer-cryptocurrency-tax-framework	Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Asked to Provide a Clearer Cryptocurrency Tax Framework - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-20T17:00	At least two US institutions have requested that the IRS propose a definitive structure for taxing cryptocurrencies in the country. As authorities see the lucrative appeal of virtual currencies, they also see that they can benefit from this wealth in some way, specifically through taxing crypto holders. However, even though cryptocurrencies may only have been thrust into the mainstream spotlight last year, taxation queries are not as recent. According to CNBC, Tyson Cross, a US-based tax attorney, began assisting clients with declaring their digital currencies from as early as 2013. His clientele has continued to grow, along with interest in the industry. Cross said: I did close to 1,000 consultations last year where I talked to people who have income from cryptocurrencies and tax questions. They realize the wild west days are coming to an end. He added: The IRS knows many people have made tremendous wealth with cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency Not Actually Currency Based on this, 2014 saw the country’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) implement guidelines on how crypto should be taxed. However, despite its name, the government did not declare it an actual currency. Jeff Bandman, a former FinTech advisor for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, explained: They said, ‘yes people call them currencies, but we’re not legally treating it as a currency because it’s not issued by a sovereign’. The IRS was relatively forward-thinking for a government body. The agency now has a dedicated in-house virtual currency team and according to the Daily Beast, have called on the services of Chainalysis to “trace the movement of money through the Bitcoin economy”. The IRS also requested that Coinbase release information on over 14,000 US taxpaying citizens using the exchange. IRS Requested to Provide Definitive Processes However, even though the industry has grown exponentially since 2014, the IRS has not issued any new regulations. This has prompted the American Institute of CPA’s to request that the agency “release additional, much needed, guidance on virtual currency.” The Treasury Department’s Inspector General had a similar request, asking that the IRS provide definitive policies regarding cryptocurrencies. Lisa Lewis, a CPA at TurboTax, had this to say: The main question we’re seeing is: how is Bitcoin taxed? People don’t understand that if you’re holding Bitcoin, you’re not taxed. https://t.co/r6XIW8rvfM #IRS will view #Bitcoin & other crypto currencies as property. Here's some filing guidelines. — Holly Forsman (@Holly500) January 19, 2018 What Crypto Holders Can Do in the Meantime In the interim, Cross had suggested that crypto holders try to preempt any tax-related issues by taking a few preventative measures. The first one being establishing a record-keeping process. Because they’re considered property in the eyes of the IRS, capital gains tax should be implemented for every crypto transaction. Holders should get into the habit of regularly downloading their transaction history on their exchanges, as well as keeping a separate record of these transactions as a backup. This could get tricky for some crypto holders though, Cross explained: That places a big burden on taxpayers. Cryptocurrency investors can have tens of thousands of exchanges [or transactions]. He also touched on the importance of keeping backup records: When you have lost records, it’s your job as a taxpayer to reconstruct those records as best as possible. After every transaction has been recorded, holders need to determine their gains and losses. With regard to the former, virtual currencies held for less than 12 months are seen as a short-term gain, while those held for longer are seen as a long-term gain. Jerry Brito, executive director of cryptocurrency think tank, Coin Center, explains: It’s no different than any other asset. If you bought a currency and hold it more than a year, your tax rate is probably going to be less than you’d otherwise pay. Cross adds that there is software available, like Bitcoin.tax, which also offers a list of crypto-aware accountants, and Cointracking.info, that will make the calculation process easier. He said: It will calculate all of your capital gains, and then you can export that as a report and use it to file your taxes. There are two ways to work it out: the “first-in, first-out” method and the “last-in, first-out” method. As the terms suggest, gains calculated by the former method are taken from the first purchase, while in the case of the latter, gains are calculated from the last purchase. Cross suggests the first option until the IRS determines otherwise: When there’s not a prescribed method, you have to use the method that is most reasonable. First-in, first-out is certainly going to be considered reasonable; it’s the most common method. Even though cryptocurrencies are taking the financial world by storm, some accountants are at a bit of a loss when dealing with them. Cross has some advice: One issue people are having is that their CPA just doesn’t know what to do. They should find a tax preparer who is familiar with cryptocurrencies. Even though a solid framework may be lacking, Cross advises that crypto holders keep their ear to the ground, or the eye to the screen in this case, for any changes in the industry. He concluded: We have no answers from the IRS on the finer details. People go to prison for not reporting their foreign bank accounts. We don’t know if a cryptocurrency exchange is a foreign financial institution. The fact that the IRS hasn’t said if people should be reporting these accounts is unfortunate, to say the least. Do you think people should be taxed on their cryptocurrencies? Will 2018 see the IRS implement more defined and clearer processes? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	interview-andrew-zimine-exscudo	Crypto Exchange Market 'Already Too Big for Current Players' - Exscudo CEO	2017-02-21T03:00	Andrew Zimine, Founding Partner and CEO of Exscudo, spoke with Bitcoinist in detail explaining his view of the cryptocurrency industry and how blockchain platform Exscudo is aiming to bridge traditional finance with the cryptocurrency market his blockchain platform. Bitcoinist: Can you describe the current cryptocurrency market? Andrew Zimine (AZ): The evolution of the cryptocurrency market makes this sphere less chaotic and more regulated each year. This is a natural process of any nascent market. The most progress is shown by those regions and jurisdictions that are most interested in both the blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies in particular. Transaction processing is a new trend in the cryptocurrency market. International companies are exploring cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument. Besides, traditional financial institutions show great interest in the blockchain, since it has enormous potential to transform the financial business. Bitcoinist: Why is the financial sector adopting blockchain solutions? AZ: The blockchain can be applied in many different ways and for different tasks. The most popular are the decrease of transaction costs, optimization of the workflow processes. The blockchain can also guarantee a higher level of security of personal and business data. Besides, I believe that it will be widely used in the validation and verification of financial transactions without third-party services. Bitcoinist: How did you come up with the idea for Exscudo? What is your mission? AZ: I have been collaborating with a major cryptocurrency exchange and consulted the team on security issues. When I saw the backend organization from inside, I understood that this sphere lacks professional players. The reason was that the market is still too small for big players, but already too big for current players. We want to create […] a system where an unbanked person can trade on the stock exchange just as simply as an institutional investor. You can easily assess it by simply reading the news: $50 mln stolen from this startup, another exchange hacked and lost $60 mln… Such scandals are part of the daily routine in the cryptocurrency market. Knowing this, I decided to create a professional trading instrument and develop an infrastructure of services around it, eliminating the need for middlemen. Our mission is to create a platform that unites the world of traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. We want to create a new global center of liquidity for all groups of users. A system where an unbanked person can trade on the stock exchange just as simply as an institutional investor. Our main goal is to create an easy-to-use, fast, legal and secure access to the cryptocurrency market for every person with access to the Internet. Bitcoinist: Why do you think your solution is better than others that are already on the market? AZ: We have a client-oriented system, and we are creating something more than a project with a return on investment within 1-2 years. Exscudo is running a marathon, not a sprint. Besides, our team consists of highly qualified specialists in all fields, from security of stock exchange trading to usability and legal questions. I think that our main advantage is that there are no analogous solutions. There is no other project that offers this wide range of products under one roof. Bitcoinist: How did you build up the team? Have you run any other projects together before? AZ: Building up the team was hard and painstakingly. For each position, I needed not only to find a highly qualified professional, but someone who has interest in Exscudo, who shares our view and spirit. The fact that the person must qualify as an expert is a must. The development of Exscudo took many years. During this time, we saw in practice, whether the person fits in or not. We also had some negative experiences when people resign or were fired. There was pretty much everything. Bitcoinist: How did you raise the initial funds for the development? AZ: Despite Exscudo, I am running other businesses, such as software development, for example. The income generated by those enterprises makes the development and functioning of Exscudo possible. Bitcoinist: Why have you decided to make the core of the Exchange centralized? AZ: Because otherwise the liability would be ill-defined. We would not be able to take responsibility for the actions that take place on the Exchange. The proprietary core is a perfect solution for this problem. This [blockchain] technology allows Exscudo to handle transactions between Exscudo Stock exchange and international banks[.] Bitcoinist: What do you need the blockchain for? AZ: EON, the blockchain, is the fuel of the whole Exscudo ecosystem. It uses the smart transactions algorithm that is similar, but not equal to the smart contracts mechanism of the Ethereum network. This technology allows Exscudo to handle transactions between Exscudo Stock exchange and international banks, as well as cryptocurrency wallet users and fiat accounts holders. It also grants our independency from third-party developers. Bitcoinist: Who are the target audience of the project? AZ: Exscudo is an ecosystem that consists of various products that have different target audiences. For example, the mobile ‘Chatwallet’ app targets private users that may even not know anything about cryptocurrencies, because the app can be used for secure communications only. On the other side, the trading terminals have been developed for professional traders. To say it shortly, Exscudo unites everybody who is interested in the cryptocurrency market, be it private users or international financial institutions. When will Exscudo be launched? AZ: We plan to launch the first line of products in Q2 2017. Images courtesy of Exscudo, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	interview-libretaxi-free-uber-lyft	Interview with LibreTaxi: The 'Free Alternative' to Lyft & Uber	2017-02-01T05:00	Bitcoinist spoke to Roman Pushkin, founder of LibreTaxi, an open-source ridesharing mobile app that will soon support Bitcoin payments, to find out more about his vision for this “free alternative” for Uber and Lyft. Ride sharing applications are becoming part of our daily lives. However, there are just some areas apps like Uber and Lyft don’t cover and a certain currency – Bitcoin, of course – that these simply do not accept as a payment system. However, new alternatives are popping up, shifting the focus on rewarding the driver and empowering the user by retaining no profits and making the app accessible to anyone. Such is the case with LibreTaxi, a cash-based, ride-sharing mobile app that will soon to integrate Bitcoin support. Interview with LibreTaxi Founder, Roman Pushkin Bitcoinist: What is LibreTaxi? Roman Pushkin (RP): It’s free alternative for Uber, Lyft, etc. It doesn’t compete with these companies directly. I made it for a remote area where I was born and found that people around the world like it. Uber probably won’t go to remote and rural areas, so LibreTaxi is perfect for that. Bitcoinist: Who is working on this project? RP: It all started as my side-project, it’s 100% coded by me. My father and friends were working on the idea, suggesting features for MVP and functionality. I discussed it a lot with people who live in rural areas and who really need this app. I just think Telegram is nice, and it’s the secret sauce that allows individuals to compete with corporations. Bitcoinist: What are the main differences between LibreTaxi and other transportation and ridesharing apps? RP: I wouldn’t compare functionality. Well-known companies have thousands of employees, but I was working on the app by myself only. Of course, LibreTaxi lacks some features at the moment. But the main difference and what makes it stand out is philosophy. LibreTaxi is free, there is no goal of earning money, there is no goal of doing a business. It’s free, has open-source spirit inside, friendly to all people around the world. Technically it works through Telegram app at the moment. However, there is no hard dependency on that (and there is even a console PoC). I just think Telegram is nice, and it’s the secret sauce that allows individuals to compete with corporations. Bitcoinist: What problem does LibreTaxi solve? RP: People need a ridesharing service in remote and rural areas where big companies will never go. At least I started with this idea in mind. Now I see how people are starting to use it in some cities as an Uber replacement. Also, you can never predict what type of taxi you want – boat, helicopter, rickshaw etc. LibreTaxi is open-sourced under MIT license. People can update it relatively easy or add vehicle types and run Uber-like services for their areas independently. Bitcoinist: Is LibreTaxi decentralized? Or does the app store any funds and information from the user? RP: It is centralized. The only reason for this is that anyone should be able to run a clone of LibreTaxi in a matter of hours and it should work nicely without any issues. The app stores the minimum required information to make it possible to work. However, we think security is important. We try to follow the same principles as the Telegram app and its founder Pavel Durov. You can read about them here. Bitcoinist: Crowdfunding is becoming widely popular, are there any plans for a LibreTaxi fund raiser? RP: I don’t think about money at the moment. But it would be nice if I could work on LibreTaxi full time. I’m looking for ways to do that. Bitcoinist: Since no registration or approval is required, how can users be sure about the quality of the ride before using this app? RP: I can confirm this problem exists at the moment. There is a technical roadmap on our GitHub page and this is something I want to improve soon. However, for some countries, it’s not the case. For example, in Russia or India, every car on the street is your potential taxi. Yes, we have a plan [to support Bitcoin], and some significant work on that has been done already… people will love how it works. Bitcoinist: According to Github, Bitcoin payments are coming. Why did LibreTaxi decide to add Bitcoin? RP: Because people want it. It was not my plan initially, but I hear this almost every day – do you have any plans to add Bitcoin integration? Yes, we have a plan, and some significant work on that has been done already. I don’t think I’m ready yet to share all the details, but people will love how it works. It’s the one of my core principles – make it cool, nice, so people will love it. Bitcoinist: When can we expect this feature? RP: I usually suck at predictions, especially when it comes to features (other software engineers suck too, but they don’t admit it). So I would say it this way: definitely by the end of 2017. Bitcoinist: How will Bitcoin payments work? Is there some sort of escrow? RP: There will be some sort of escrow. I’d like to, but I just can’t share all these details right now because of a signed NDA. I can only say integration will be seamless and secure. Bitcoinist: Are there plans to integrate other cryptocurrencies or payment methods? Perhaps ShapeShift, for example, to enable payments with multiple cryptos? RP: Have you heard about the WeChat messenger app? It has a built-in payment method. It’s really easy to use – I was amazed how easy it is. So some part of the integration will be done right through the Telegram app. There’s no payments support at the moment, but all I can say – there were rumors that it will be added by the end of 2016. I was also thinking about ShapeShift and some other options. As you can see, it’s a very interesting and challenging task. [T]he main idea of LibreTaxi – we don’t charge drivers and never will no matter what. Bitcoinist: Arcade City is an Ethereum-based Dapp that has been dubbed as the ‘Uber killer.’ It has received a lot of criticism for being vaporware or even a scam. What are your thoughts on Arcade City? RP: They have Facebook group and I got banned there only because of saying I have an idea of an Uber-like app in development — I even said it in the comments. It was expected, since they’re focused on earning money. I think they don’t understand that drivers don’t want to pay 20-30% cut to corporations. That’s the main idea of LibreTaxi – we don’t charge drivers and never will no matter what. I’d better live under the bridge than cut 1% for using the app. They may have a future, and I like some of their technical ideas, but I think without the right philosophy behind their service they’re doomed. Bitcoinist: Uber has been regulated in certain countries and even banned. Is this a problem that may affect LibreTaxi? RP: Anything could happen. I was building this app with the idea in mind that it should never be able to get banned. So initially, the source-code is not dependent on Telegram, and Telegram is just one of the channels. Right now, I can add another channel relatively easy and it can communicate [with the app] without any problems. I like the spirit of Telegram because the founder fights for freedom. I don’t believe Telegram can ban us because of some regulations. Especially when LibreTaxi does not take any money for itself. In some states, this circumvents a lot of the regulations. Bitcoinist: Are you targeting any specific markets, cities or demographics? RP: Our main market is rural areas, but it seems like it’s expanding into cities now. I have to think about improving and polishing functionality to make it even more easier to use. Bitcoinist: What is next for LibreTaxi? Any exciting updates coming, besides Bitcoin support? RP: Yes, we’re going to add medium-sized truck support and scheduled services. I like how lugg.com works, I tried it once when I moved to Silicon Valley from Russia. There are some problems we need to solve prior to this, but I think it’s possible. You can j oin our LibreTaxi news Telegram channel for updates: https://telegram.me/libretaxi_news. What are your thoughts on LibreTaxi’s vision? Can it become a viable service? Images courtesy of Shutterstock, LibreTaxi.org
bitcoinist	interview-with-dmarket-the-first-cross-game-marketplace-for-in-game-items	Interview with DMarket: The First Cross-Game Marketplace for In-Game Items - Bitcoinist.com	2017-08-11T16:15	Bitcoinist spoke with Volodymyr Panchenko, Founder and CEO of DMarket, a first-of-its-kind marketplace that allows gamers to buy, sell, or trade in-game items from any game on any gaming platform. Bitcoinist: What is DMarket? VP: DMarket is the first cross-game marketplace that allows gamers from all over the world to trade or exchange in-game goods originating from any gaming platform. In fact, DMarket will allow more than two billion gamers to buy and sell their items. Existing games and platforms are currently covering only 6% of gamers worldwide. We will give this opportunity to everybody. Bitcoinist: What is the difference between you and Steam, for example? Are there any other competitive advantages that your platform has comparing to the other existing ones? VP: As I just mentioned, our platform will satisfy the “trade needs” of all gamers, as opposed to the other platforms that currently cover 130M (6%) video game players. I am not saying we are better and they are worse. Ours is just a different approach. We use blockchain technology that makes this set-up possible. Let me explain: technology actually lies at the core of the problem. To make trading possible on a large scale we need to synchronize hundreds of thousands of databases. We are using a decentralized database on blockchain to address this. All operations are fast, secure and synchronized in real time. The important part is that a sale or exchange of any virtual item from any game or platform can happen in one click. This turns each and every virtual item into a real commodity for billions of gamers worldwide. Bitcoinist: How does DMarket work with game developers? VP : Using our API, any game developer can easily connect its game to DMarket. These days we are talking to Unreal, Unity and CryEngine developers to feature DMarket libraries on their engines. This will simplify and improve game developers access to our platform. Bitcoinist: Are there any benefits for game publishers? VP: Both mobile and PC game publishers will benefit from working with us. We can help them drive their direct revenues. DMarket gets a commission from every deal and the major part of it goes to the rights holder. There’s also what we call “shared marketing”. By promoting our platform, we promote all the video games available there. As a result, the game publisher doesn’t need to invest as much into marketing. Marketing budgets can be reduced! The third benefit is the increased lifetime value. By giving gamers worldwide the opportunity to make money by trading, exchanging and “hunting down” rare in-game items, we are prolonging the lifetime of the games. Based on our experience in game trading, out of 10 thousand games that we trade every day, 80% are more than 2 years old. Our platform increases the life cycle of the games. Bitcoinist: You’ve just mentioned about your experience in game trading. Could you please tell us more about your expertise? VP: Being the founder of Suntechsoft company, I can say that I’m quite an expert when it comes to game trading. Suntechsoft is the number one private merchant of digital games in the world. In the past 5 years, we sold over 15 million games via eBay, G2A, and Kinguin. I am also the founder of skins.cash, the 2nd biggest virtual items marketplace (12M items sold in the past year alone). With total annual revenues of $50M. So yes, I’ve got expertise in virtual items and games trading. Bitcoinist: What about the rest of the DMarket top management team? VP: We have a core team of 3. We all come from different work backgrounds. Co-founder of DMarket Alexander “ZeroGravity” Kokhanovskyy has 17 years of experience in eSports. He is the founder of Na`Vi (Natus Vincere), one of the most popular and successful eSports teams in the world. In 2016 he became a shareholder of ESforce Holdings, the 3rd biggest eSports entity funded by USM Group (Mail.ru, VK.com, Megafon) which raised over $100M of investments in the latest round. There’s also Andriy Khavryuchenko, the senior developer of DASH cryptocurrency (world top 7, market cap $1.4B). He has 4 years of experience in crypto development and 26 years of experience in software development. Bitcoinist: Since you have experience in trading and cryptocurrency development, are you planning token emission? VP: The only technology allowing Dmarket to run is decentralized blockchain. Since we can not put a hundred dollar bill into the smart contract, we definitely need to have tokens. Dmarket tokens will be the only native currency of the platform for all trades, exchanges, and fees. DMarket launches the first round of token sales on August 17, 2017. The second round will follow in November 2017. Tokens will be available to trade within 30 days on major cryptocurrency exchange. Bitcoinist: What are the minimum and maximum amounts of money you plan to collect during ICO? VP: The minimum amount we aim for is 5 million DMarket tokens with 1 ETH being equal to 1,000 DMarket tokens. The maximum amount is 50 million tokens. Bitcoinist: What are the reasons to buy DMarket tokens? How can you guarantee the value of your currency? VP: Every purchase, sale, exchange or any other transaction on our platform will require the use of DMarket tokens. No further emissions are planned beyond the first two trading rounds. The amount of trading and exchanging transactions on the platform will naturally grow fast over time and so will grow the need for the tokens. That is the best guarantee of DMarket tokens value. Bitcoinist: What makes you think that the amount of purchase, sale, exchange and other transaction on your platform will go up? VP : They will go up as the industry as a whole grows. We are witnessing a rapid growth of the gaming industry. It’s estimated that 2.2 billion gamers will generate $108 billion of revenue this year. This is a 6.8% growth on 2016.

bitcoinist	interview-with-esports-game-changer-eloplay	Interview with eSports Game Changer Eloplay - Bitcoinist.com	2017-10-10T15:00	Bitcoinist spoke with Vitaly Balakhonov, CEO of Eloplay, the eSports platform that allows players to organize and participate in tournaments with decentralized prize pools through the use of its innovative blockchain-based Smart Tournaments. Eloplay’s ICO begins on October 16, 2017. Bitcoinist: How did you come up with the idea for Eloplay? VB: At first it was a simple idea to create a service for one-on-one video games competitions. In April 2016, the platform hosted the first trial battles where opponents were chosen randomly. That was exciting to watch first battles happening. The feedback from players encouraged us greatly as well. During this time we needed some fast and convenient way to reward our players and we chose Bitcoin for that. I remember that it cost around $400 then. Eloplay was initially created as a platform for one-on-one eSports tournaments. Still, the team eventually realized that the project might become a full-fledged eSports platform hosting team-vs-team tournaments. Over 18 months, we’ve been testing various hypotheses related to involving players in different game modes. We tested different options of matchmaking and profile upgrading, which resulted in the introduction of Elo Rating based on FIDE rules. We also developed tournament modules: we abandoned one-on-one battles for team tournaments, which include Best of N, Single Elimination, and Double Elimination. At the same time, we looked into our monetization options. Eventually, the team discovered blockchain technology that caused us to take a fresh look at classical problems of an eSports platform. Issuance of tokens and introduction of smart contracts opened the gate for a completely new functionality like smart tournaments. Bitcoinist: What was the impetus behind the decision to connect eSports and blockchain? VB: Blockchain gives our world a lot of new opportunities. We see that it should be definitely be used in our eSports industry. Then we came out with the idea of decentralized prize pools. Such approach will give users and sponsors amazing opportunities for tournaments participation. Tournaments are the most exciting esports events. Eloplay proposes Smart Tournaments as a solution to the challenges faced by eSports today. Smart Tournaments are eSports skill competitions with decentralized prize pools. In these tournaments, prize pools are funded by players or tournament organizers. Funds are gathered in Eloplay Tokens and the Smart Tournaments can be either player-organized or sponsored. The main idea behind player-organized Smart Tournaments is to give users the freedom to create tournaments and make up decentralized prize pools. Once the entry fee is set, the prize pool is formed out of all entry fees paid by the participants. Prize pools of $5,000 and higher are considered major. In order to raise such funds for a tournament of 1024 players, one player would have to pay only $4.88. The organizing player would have 8% of this fund, i.e. $400. It is important to note, however, that USD prices are for explanatory purposes only, and in actuality, all settlements will be conducted in Eloplay tokens. Currently, Smart Tournaments are the only opportunities for an amateur player to battle for a major prize pool, which can be scaled from $5,000 to $1,000,000 and so on. Bitcoinist: Why do you need smart contracts for tournaments? VB: Smart contracts are used to form decentralized prize pools for tournaments. Smart contract receives Eloplay tokens before the start of a tournament. Tokens can be added by players, sponsors of tournaments or by Eloplay. When tournament ends and system defines a winner, smart contract receives winner’s ID’s via API and makes token distribution among winners’ wallets. Using smart contracts for tournaments has two main benefits: Decentralization of prize pools. We remove a controlling node which can influence on speed and honesty of prize pool distribution. That also keeps low transaction fees. Transparency of conditions and execution of prize pool distribution conditions. Since prize pool distribution conditions get to the smart contract before the tournament starts, no one can affect these settings and players can be sure how the prize pool will be distributed among winners. Bitcoinist: How long has Eloplay been in operation? VB: Eloplay is soon to celebrate its two-year anniversary. The project kicked off in November 2015 with the idea to create a service for one-on-one video games competitions. In April 2016, the platform hosted the first trial battles where opponents were chosen randomly. The winners received bitcoin rewards. Today Eloplay is an operational esports platform with 90,000 registered users and 80,000 finished battles. We’ve already hosted 3,500 one-on-one and team tournaments. There are 3 competitive modes on the platform: quick battles (matchmaking with random opponents), duels (select with whom to fight), and tournaments. The site offers both Russian and English interfaces. Eloplay is a community-driven startup. Most ongoing tournaments are organized in cooperation with enthusiastic eSports organizations of post-Soviet countries. That keeps the Eloplay team connected with our audience. And we’re determined to keep on that approach in the future when it comes to work with global esports organizations. Bitcoinist: What games does your platform currently support and will you be adding any new games in the near future? VB: Today Eloplay supports 4 most popular eSports disciplines in the world: League of Legends with 100,000,000 monthly active players worldwide, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft (70,000,000), Dota2 (12,500,000), Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (11,600,000). These are also the most watched games on Twitch. Nearly 200 million gamers make up the global target Eloplay audience. To attract such numbers to the platform we plan to spend 40% of funds raised through our upcoming token sale on marketing. As for new games, we plan to add Starcraft, Overwatch, WoT, and FIFA. Plus we’re looking to integrate gaming consoles (Xbox and PS) to Eloplay. Bitcoinist: What has the players’ response been to the new Smart Tournament features on Eloplay? VB: Players are really excited. We asked a number of players and eSports experts and got positive feedback from them. Our eSports advisor, professional CS:GO player Danil Teslenko, has said that “Eloplay creates an amazing opportunity for young players to raise own game level and show their skills to the whole world. I really like the platform and the idea of Smart Tournaments”. In addition to attracting players, Smart Tournaments will also attract brands and sponsors to the platform who want to hold their own tournaments to engage with our eSports audience. Bitcoinist: What are Eloplay tokens and how are they used on Eloplay? VB: Eloplay t okens are the main accounting unit at the platform. They are the basis for the Eloplay economy and bonus system. Token holders will use them for tournaments but also have an opportunity to change tokens to Ether, Bitcoin or fiat money. In fact, that is universal exchange unit for Eloplay audience. Having our own token for the platform also keeps transaction costs lower which is obviously good both our users and for us. Bitcoinist: Can you tell us about additional blockchain-based features that you plan to implement? VB: First of all, we plan to implement an advertising module which allows brands to promote their products and services directly to eSports audience. Recently we agreed to a partnership with Adex.network which allows us to integrate their blockchain based advertising module. We also know that eSports betting market is huge and some evaluate it even bigger than eSports market itself. After we get the relevant licenses, blockchain-based betting will be implemented to Eloplay. The next step would be a system for players’ contracts and transfers between teams. This will be done using smart contracts and all transfers will be paid with Eloplay tokens. New partnership @AdEx_Network and #EloPlay eSports platform for Marketing and Advertising efforts. https://t.co/J3SBShhzSW — Rayah Major (@RayahMajor) September 28, 2017 Are you an eSports gamer?

bitcoinist	interview-with-jincor-co-founder-and-coo-vagan-abelyan	Interview with Jincor Co-Founder and COO Vagan Abelyan - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-24T14:00	Even though everyone is talking about smart contracts and their advantages over traditional paper contracts, only a handful of people are addressing the elephant in the room: most of the businesses don’t know how to use smart contracts yet. Vagan Abelyan, the COO and co-founder of Jincor, is among those few who are trying to make smart contracts and other blockchain technologies more accessible to modern businesses. [Note: This is a sponsored article.] At Jincor, Abelyan and coworkers aim to integrate companies, employees, and businesses under a single blockchain ecosystem, eliminating the legal and technical complications that are currently associated with smart contracts and cryptocurrency payments. Recently, Bitcoinist had the opportunity to sit down and chat with COO Vagan Abelyan about Jincor, smart contracts, and the company’s future plans and we are pleased to share with you the transcript of that interview. Bitcoinist: How did the team come up with the idea for the Jincor platform? VA: I speak both for myself and Vladislav Kirichenko, my friend and the second co-founder of Jincor, when I say that the idea for Jincor emerged from our life-long fascination with innovative technologies with the power to change people’s lives. We at Jincor believe that modern technologies should be used to improve the quality of human lives by automating routine activities that prevent people from fully realizing their personal potential. No other technology in recent years has had such a huge transformative capacity as smart contracts, and we are excited to be at the forefront of smart contract development. Bitcoinist: How do you think will businesses benefit from Smart Contracts? VA: Businesses that decide to embrace smart contracts and cryptocurrency payments at very least can greatly increase their efficiency and speed of transactions. So far, only some of the largest enterprises in the world have been able to benefit from smart contracts due to the inherent complexity of the technology. That’s what we would like to change. Jincor, the company we are building, aims to be the place where every business—large or small—can easily benefit from cryptocurrency payments and create smart contracts that work flawlessly right out of the box without any coding whatsoever. Once we bring smart contracts to businesses worldwide and enable them to integrate the technology into their activities with no legal or technological complications, we expect that they will be used for anything from bypassing bureaucracy to expanding outside of local markets, increasing the speed of turnover, and much more. Bitcoinist: Which particular sectors do you believe will benefit the most from Smart Contracts? VA: Every sector that relies heavily on traditional paper contracts can benefit from smart contracts. Recent research indicates that investment banks alone could save up to $12 billion per year by adopting smart contracts, and I expect to see similarly huge savings across the finance sector. The legal sector is also likely to eagerly embrace smart contracts as a way to cut down on paperwork and speed up processing times. Worth mentioning is also the public sector, which could use smart contracts for more efficient outsourcing and improved transparency. Bitcoinist: Does Jincor currently have any competitors? VA: As far as I know, there is currently no other solution that is doing what we at Jincor do – developing a platform that makes smart contracts easy to use and integrate by anyone without any coding or worrying about legal, technical, or operational complications. For example, Monetha is bringing easy crypto payments to retailers, BlockCat is trying to simplify the creation of smart contracts, and Aragon is building a digital jurisdiction. Jincor solves all of these problems at once, and it even includes a digital arbitration system to settle disputes related to the performance of smart contracts. Bitcoinist: How is Jincor planning to establish itself in the global market? VA: We see how the global economy is shifting toward crypto, with cryptocurrency payments being accepted by increasingly more retailers around the world and new blockchain companies popping left and right. Huge sums of money are being poured into smart contract projects, and many of the largest enterprises in the world, including Microsoft and IBM, are trying to grab the spotlight. Jincor wants to be the project that makes the cryptocurrency-driven vision of the future happen by allowing companies of all sizes to use the same cutting-edge technology as the largest players in the market. We address cost-related and complexity issues, handle the legal side of things, and ensure that all interactions between our users meet regulatory and corporate compliance policies. Bitcoinist: How long has the team been working on the Jincor platform? VA: We’ve been developing Jincor since May 2016, and have recently successfully completed a closed beta test with 30 small and medium-sized businesses across different industries. Since we wrote the first line of code, our vision of what Jincor should be has changed significantly, but I’m proud to say that our original backers have stayed behind us and are happy with the current state of the platform. When developing a project in a space that changes so rapidly as crypto does, I think it’s only natural that not every eventuality can be accounted for at the start. On top of that, our entire team has gained a tremendous amount of experience, and we are now more certain than ever before when it comes to our long-term goals and the future of Jincor. Bitcoinist: In which countries/continents are you planning to expand in the future? VA: Early in 2018, we would like to focus on the Japanese market and then launch marketing campaigns in Europe and the rest of Asia – countries with existing cryptocurrency legislation. Considering the pivotal role Japan has been playing in cryptocurrency development since the launch of Bitcoin, we see the country as the shining city upon a hill that all other countries look up to and see as an example. If we gain tracking in Japan, Europe and the rest of Asia will be easy. At least I hope so. Bitcoinist: Does Jincor currently have any partnerships with corporations or businesses? VA: Absolutely. We have completed our closed beta in cooperation with 30 small and medium-sized businesses across different industries, and we already have over 300 companies from all over the world lined up for access to our open beta. Before 2018 is over, we expect that well over 10,000 business customers will have participated in the open beta. At the same time, we are negotiating with a number of well-known companies, but I can’t name any of them before we have everything on paper and signed. Bitcoinist: How are you planning to secure customer’s information and funds? VA: Apart from being a piece of software that solves essential problems, Jincor is also an infrastructure, a private permissioned distributed ledger based on non-mining consensus algorithm, that allows users to create smart contracts of the highest confidentiality level. And that additional level of security is an extremely important feature for any tech solution that is supposed to store any business-related information. To use the platforms key functionalities, all registered users have to go through KYC/AML procedures to confirm their identities. For further security, Jincor also makes it possible to create multisig wallets, which require approval from a number of authorized people to get a transaction processed. Bitcoinist: Where do you see the Jincor platform in the next 5 years? VA: In the next 5 years, we would like Jincor to include corporate cryptocurrency accounts with multisig support, smart contract templates, and even a decentralized arbitration system for settling disputes. We would like all this to happen in a user-friendly way and with no legal or technical complications. We have a realistic roadmap to make all this happen. Naturally, we can also envision many other related products and services that can be organically added to Jincor, but we like to take things one step at the time and not get too ahead of ourselves. By the end of the day, we want to create that perfect one-stop place on the internet where all the businesses can embrace emerging blockchain technologies and easily roll it out to improve all existing operational processes making them faster, more transparent, more cost-efficient, and secure. Will Jincor’s smart contract solution pave the way for more businesses to begin integrating blockchain technology? Do you have any questions for Vagan Abelyan? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	interview-with-token-fund-the-etf-alternative-for-cryptocurrency-investing	Interview With The Token Fund: The ETF Alternative for Cryptocurrency Investing - Bitcoinist.com	2017-09-25T21:30	Bitcoinist spoke with Viktor Shpakovsky and Vladimir Smerkis, the founders of The Token Fund, which allows investors an easy portal into the world of cryptocurrency trading, investment, and management. Bitcoinist: Tell us about The Token Fund in your own words. What makes The Token Fund similar to other funds and in what ways is it unique? Vladimir: We launched The Token Fund in March 2017. Over the past five months, the portfolio under our management has reached about $2 million USD, and our performance updated to the date is 380% in USD. The model here resembles that of classic ETFs (exchange-traded funds), something that for the past 20 years has remained one of the most popular tools for both institutional and private investors, primarily due to the entry and exit features. Just like with shares in traditional ETFs, investors of The Token Fund buy the fund’s tokens (TKN), paying in BTC and ETH. The price of tokens depends on the size of the assets in the fund’s portfolio. Viktor: Higher liquidity of our investments sets us apart from a number of hedge funds on the cryptocurrency market. We have decidedly done away with entry barriers that have hampered consumers in the past. At The Token Fund, there are no requirements for minimum investment sizes or onerous terms. To join our ranks, all one needs is some BTC or ETH in his or her wallet. That is also where the funds will be returned whenever one decides to exit the fund if they choose to do so. Moreover, blockchain enables full transparency of all the operations. Our investors can see the wallets and all the activity that occurs, which ensures that any fraud or manipulation is impossible. Our portfolio is managed manually and changes at least once a day, and all actions are transparent to our investors throughout the day. At the moment, we have over 25 different crypto assets in our portfolio. Bitcoinist: Can you tell us about your journey into the crypto-market as well as your experience in the cryptocurrency world? Viktor: Five years ago, a friend of mine told me he was mining BTC. I remember having zero clues as to what he was going on about, so I couldn’t actually maintain the conversation. However, that awakened my curiosity so I did my due research more carefully. After all, I didn’t mine anything myself, but as a trader, I was fascinated by the dynamics of that nascent market. I started following and analyzing it. After a couple of years, the inner workings of the intricate mechanism more or less dawned on me; I finally had in my head the full picture of the system and its potential. It was at that point when I switched from theory to practice, starting to trade independently in blockchain assets. Later, with a few years’ experience under my belt, I partnered with Vladimir to shape the idea of a fund. We have an excellent team at The Token Fund, but I’ll let Vladimir tell his side of the story. Vladimir: I was brought to the cryptocurrency market following the story of the founder of Ethereum, Vitaly Buterin. I was Deputy Vice President for International Development at the Mail.ru Group back then, and as a person with a digital and marketing background, I was intrigued and fascinated by this whole thing. So I started to study the market and follow the events. Over time, just like Viktor, I started investing privately. In my portfolio, there are over 25 different crypto assets, the lion’s share of which are ETH-based projects. Hordes of new ICOs inflate the volume of transactions, which in turn stimulates more demand. Besides, if you’re holding long-term, Ethereum is a technologically superior platform to the date. By comparison, BTC transactions take a lot more effort and time. Bitcoinist: Why is crypto investing the new hot way to invest? What are the opportunities that have arisen from digital currencies? Vladimir: The initial wave of funding came to the industry for the genuine advantages of the blockchain technology, such as free, open transactions. Today, the market dynamics and its potential depend on additional factors, which is attracting a much wider circle of investors. Four years ago, the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem was valued at roughly $1 billion USD. Today, it’s above $130 billion USD, but that amount is just a drop in the bucket when compared to the overall investment opportunities worldwide. The cryptocurrencies market is far from overheated, and it has tremendous potential for further growth. The influx of professional and private investors, including some very large players who are just beginning to appreciate the field, promises manifold growth in the next 2 to 3 years. Viktor: Crypto assets are a good hedging opportunity in the eyes of many investors. A recent case in point is the spark of interest that arose in BTC and other cryptocurrencies when the US and North Korea started trading bold, sharply-worded statements. At the moments of geopolitical turmoil, more and more people begin to appreciate BTC, and cryptocurrencies in general, as reserve assets that are also a more reliable instrument of saving. Bitcoinist: How different is crypto portfolio building compared to traditional investor portfolios, and what about the management of these portfolios? In what ways can The Token Fund help investors? Viktor: Bitcoin investors must understand and keep in mind not just the eye-popping profits but also the extreme volatility of this market. Its fluctuations far, far exceed what investors in traditional funds and markets are used to. Always expect drastic changes in rates as there is always a possibility of correction. Vladimir: To retain profitability, there are two winning scenarios for investors: either trade 24/7 or, in the case of a more passive approach, plan for an investment horizon of 6 months or longer. Just like with any investment strategy, it makes sense to set a fixed timeline for turning a profit. After that, use the earnings accumulated to make further investments. Viktor: Besides, there is the well-known golden rule: don’t keep all your eggs in one basket. At any given moment, our portfolio contains over 20 different assets in varying proportions. Along with BTC and ETH, it can include a number of more notable alt-coins, along with tokens of tech and infrastructure projects. We have a staff of professional analysts with traditional backgrounds in banking and investment, and they are always up to speed with the market. They keep assessing and reassessing the market situation, making several changes a day. Vladimir: It should be noted that the strategy of The Token Fund is at the lower risk end of the spectrum: moderate growth, minimized risks. We prefer not to chase excessive profits, opting instead for safer bets in the interest of the safety of the assets under our management. Before exposing our portfolio to a new instrument, we carefully analyze the market, take a good look at the team and their background, and study the documentation, particularly the white papers. We examine the shares in terms of balance and profitability. For those investors who share our lower risk approach and prefer passive investment strategies, buying TKN, our share-representing crypto tokens, may be the optimal go-to-market strategy. Bitcoinist: Is it good that there is a flow of traditional investors joining the crypto market? What can they add, and how do they benefit from something like The Token Fund? Viktor: Large players and traditional institutions are only beginning to study this market. However, even the biggest sharks in the sea, such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, admit that there’s no way they can further ignore the potential of cryptocurrencies. Consultants from the Big Four are hunting for professionals in this new field and have recently begun to offer legal and tax support for their customers’ blockchain projects. The arrival of the traditional players may drastically increase the size of the market while simultaneously decreasing the market’s volatility a great deal. However, this change will take its time: the market will take the next 2 to 3 years to saturate, stabilize, and establish clearer rules and regulations. Vladimir: We also predict that as the market grows, traditional investors will have to study the technology and learn to work with crypto assets. The market will need new infrastructure solutions to facilitate interactions between the players. The Token Fund’s team is currently planning to develop a new infrastructure ecosystem that will change the way traders interact with passive investors, the announcement of the Tokenbox.io is coming soon. Stay tuned! Do you think that more investors will dip their toes into the realm of digital currencies through The Token Fund? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	invisible-war-how-to-stop-being-screwed-by-centralized-crypto-exchanges	Invisible War: How to Stop Being Screwed by Centralized Crypto Exchanges - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-24T01:30	The impetus behind Bitcoin’s success is, without doubt, society’s increasing demand decentralize money. Rapidly growing dissatisfaction with banks and governmental monetary policies have led people to seek new methods of storing and transferring value that would eliminate intermediaries, central authorities and regulators. Being controlled by an algorithm and maintained by a decentralized community of miners, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have created endless opportunities for the underbanked and unbanked. Add to that the decreased risk of fraud, censorship, and forced inflation, and it’s no wonder that cryptocurrencies have gained so much popularity. Like all new technologies, however, there are growing pains. A s the cryptocurrency market grew, a major flaw became evident – a rigidly centralized infrastructure that was too critical to the ecosystem to be able to do anything other than grin and bear it for years. Our New Crypto Overlords We are, of course, talking about the cryptocurrency exchanges. Back in the days of Bitcoin’s infancy, when cryptocurrency felt more like a brilliant game than anything else, we did not have a need for these institutions. Coins were stored in personal wallets and transferred in a peer-to-peer fashion. But then Bitcoin became a valuable commodity, while at the same time dozens – hundreds – of new alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) were being introduced. Handling multiple cryptocurrency wallets quickly became cumbersome and, with the growing interest in altcoins, coupled with tokens becoming more popular, small trade forums could no longer keep up with growing demand. Given the explosion of the crypto market, it was, perhaps, inevitable that someone would come along and create a large platform for cryptocurrency trading. Frequent and large-scale switching between crypto and fiat money required a traditional point of exchange. Those platforms had owners who became the intermediaries and guarantors, overseeing and facilitating thousands of trade contracts daily which were no longer trustless. In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, which we see as being free, decentralized, and trustless, these centralized exchanges are a self-defeating concept. But what other alternative did crypto traders have at the time? We were, as they say, caught over a barrel. So the crypto community willingly handed their tokens and money into the custody of these new intermediaries, trusting that they would be safe. Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, Cryptsy, and other exchanges taught us otherwise. Our cryptocurrencies were vulnerable on these centralized exchanges – both to the possibility of an outside hack and to the threat of unscrupulous exchange operators. Hackers and shady operators aside, centralized exchanges suffer from serious inherent flaws. The worst of these flaws are a lack of transparency and prevalent censorship. While it might never be proven, some exchange hacks are still thought by some to have been inside jobs and there is no getting around the fact that exchanges can make or break the fate of a token by virtue of their ability to unilaterally decide which tokens to list. Making Cryptocurrency Decentralized Again With the advance of blockchain technology and smart contracts, attempts were made to create autonomous decentralized exchanges meant to make the cryptocurrency marketplace a trustless and intermediary-free place again. This new breed of exchanges essentially provides the infrastructure for seamless peer-to-peer trading. This offers a number of very clear benefits compared to centralized exchanges: No centralized points of failure that can be easily compromised. No verification is required which guarantees anonymity and high accessibility. Since there is no ‘owner’ operating these exchanges, they are immune to price manipulations, inside jobs and account freezes. Users retain complete control of their digital assets. Decentralized exchanges do not require that users store funds on online servers, instead allowing users to trade directly from personal wallets. All interactions are run on tokens’ main blockchains which guarantees transparency and security. Even with all the obvious benefits, decentralized exchanges have so far failed to gain the popularity of their centralized counterparts. Ironically, the reasons they should technically be better than centralized exchanges are the reasons why they remain unpopular. Being non-profit services, decentralized exchanges suffer from slow trading engines and an extremely limited set of market instruments. Lack of even the most basic trading features like margin trading and lending make them ill-suited for active day-trading or speculation. As a result, most traders prefer to take risks for the sake of the features and more reliable performance that centralized exchanges provide. Hybrid Solution Today we are standing on the cusp of a major paradigm shift. The cryptocurrency market reached unthinkable heights last year and cryptocurrencies are becoming a widely used commodity. At the same time, with unrelenting hacker attacks and governmental pressure, it is just a question of time until the next centralized exchange goes kaput. A new solution is needed – one that mitigates the risks inherent in centralized exchanges while offering the tools and performance that traders need. The team at EXPREAD believes that they have found that solution. EXPREAD co-founder Tamar Menteshashvili states: The system is a hybrid model effectively designed to combine the advantages of decentralized and centralized cryptocurrency exchange infrastructure and governance features. Combining the best of both worlds, EXPREAD boasts sophisticated functionality and high-performance engine combined with high security, fully transparent and auditable operations, joint governance, and no single point of failure. In a nutshell, while EXPREAD ecosystem will retain the concept of individual centralized exchanges, said exchanges will be connected in a seamless ecosystem all sharing one order book, trading engine, and liquidity pool. With a shared liquidity pool, anyone will be able to create and maintain their own node of exchange, achieving formidable decentralization and great synergy value from the network effect as an added bonus. Leo Liu, CEO of EXPREAD, notes: 2018 promises to be an important year for our platform as the team puts forth a global agenda in order to ensure its fast and sustainable development through acquiring strong partnerships and further funding. He further adds: We are inviting the active crypto enthusiasts to join our telegram global community in order to gain more insight directly from the founders and technical team of the platform. Like other decentralized exchanges, however, the success of this platform depends upon global adoption and a loyal community of traders willing to maintain this infrastructure for the common benefit.

bitcoinist	ios-app-cash-bits-stores-spare	Who Needs ATMs? This iOS App Cashes Out Your Bits at Retail Stores	2017-01-11T03:00	Spare app has added Bitcoin payment support, allowing users to cash out in national currencies in select U.S. regions using any iOS device. Spare: Cash Out Bits at Your Local Store Spare, an alternative finance app that allows users to withdrawal cash on-the-go through various merchant locations, now supports Bitcoin. Using the Spare app, users can now cash out their bitcoin at certain local stores. The services is currently available in certain parts of the U.S, including New York, Colorado, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Washington DC. While there are currently a few alternatives to cash out bitcoins such as exchanges and Bitcoin ‘ATMs’, Spare bypasses these legacy methods using a secure QR code that is shown to a pre-designated merchant, who will then give you cash in exchange once approved. Spare founder and CEO D’ontra Hughes told Bitcoinist, SPARE is mainly solving the issue of liquidity with your own bitcoin balance. So, when you don’t have a bitcoin ATM nearby – you would use our merchant network. The merchant does not have to accept bitcoin, as the technology converts and issues a market value that can be redeemed in cash. The Santa Monica-based service also claims to benefit small businesses by “increasing foot traffic” and reducing the liability of having extra cash on hand while reducing the operating and security costs of housing a Bitcoin ATM. “I get people asking if I have an ATM all the time. Now I can finally help them with SPARE and do it all from my iPad,” reads one review from a merchant called Rose Market. U.S. residents can download the app right now to see how many participating merchants are nearby. Bitcoin ATMs: Few and Far Between The Bitcoin infrastructure has growing immensely throughout the years, with a growing number of merchants and services accepting Bitcoin, alongside online exchanges enabling users to convert into almost any currency. Bitcoin ATMs have also evolved and grown in popularity since the first one was placed in Canada in 2013. There are currently 945 ATMs throughout 55 countries according to Coin ATM Radar with the highest density in North America and Europe. Additionally, not all machines are “two-way,” i.e. you can only buy bitcoins but not receive cash for your bitcoin deposit. Despite the growing numbers however, their availability is still just a drop in the ocean when compared to regular ATM networks and legacy banking infrastructure. Even if there is one in your hometown, they can be hard to find and more often than not, you’ll have to travel to reach it. “No more you have to waste time searching for Bitcoin ATMs, as everything can be done directly from your iOS device,” adds Hughes. The Underbanked & Unbanked Bitcoin enables peoples to transact directly without involvement of governments and middlemen with limited infrastructure — only an internet connection is needed. Thus, it can also help the unbanked and underbanked population who do not have access to financial services. Currently, there are an estimated 2-3 billion people in the planet with little or no access to financial services. Moreover, more than half of adults in the poorest 40% of households in developing countries lack a bank account. But while Bitcoin can be used to transfer money internationally for much lower fees than traditional payment methods, converting them into cash can be a problem. This is commonly known as the “last mile” problem in remittances. Spare’s approach of ‘crowdsourcing’ merchants to replace ATMs could prove to be a helpful tool in getting cash into peoples’ hands from their received bitcoins. Meanwhile, the company has also announced it will be extending its services internationally to Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Italy, Spain, and Nicaragua. Therefore, such a solution has the potential to close the loop, and deliver on the promise of much cheaper blockchain-based remittances compared to legacy services like Western Union. Can merchants be a better solution for cashing out than Bitcoin ATMs? Share your thoughts below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Coinatmradar, Spare
bitcoinist	iota-shoots-fourth-highest-market-cap-massive-rally	IOTA Shoots to Fourth Highest Market Cap In Massive Rally - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-06T05:00	IOTA has posted nearly 400% gains since the beginning of this week, pushing it up through the top 10 market caps in a matter of days to displace Ripple as the fourth largest cryptocurrency. It’s official: IOTA is mooning. The altcoin opened up the week with prices hovering around $1.40 on December 2nd. Today it reached an all-time $5.55, a staggering increase of nearly 400% over a matter of four days. Soaring Ever Higher The price increase added more than $12 billion to its market cap, quickly pushing it through the top 10 cryptocurrencies to where it currently sits at #4. Should IOTA’s price surge to $10, it would push Bitcoin Cash out of its long-held third place position. A price of $16 would displace Ethereum from its throne in second place. The rally coincides with an announcement last week by the IOTA Foundation that it had joined with several large tech companies such as Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco, Volkswagen, and Huawei to launch a secure marketplace for data. IOTA aims to build a blockchain-based network for companies to share and sell data between one another. IOTA is built around the concept of an “Internet of Things,” where physical devices such as vehicles, appliances, and other gadgets are able to share data via embedded technology. These seemingly unrelated devices would then be able to autonomously communicate with each other and share useful information, such as medical or location data. Collecting the Data Likewise, the IOTA network would allow companies to gather, manage, and share data between one another on an immutable ledger. Although 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are generated on a daily basis, the vast majority of it is either lost, goes unused, or becomes lost in a never-ending scramble of new information. Solving this problem has already generated countless new fields of study, from data analytics to data warehousing. IOTA differs from traditional blockchain projects due to its blockless “Tangle” ledger. The Tangle ledger is able to settle transactions on the IOTA network with zero fees. With this, IOTA plans to provide a way for companies to securely and transparently gather data while allowing them to exchange it with other companies on the network. IOTA is currently only traded on a handful of exchanges including Bitfinex, Binance, and a few Korean exchanges such as Coinone and OKEx. Bitfinex currently accounts for roughly 60% of it’s trading volume, while Binance handles roughly 16% of all transactions. Because Bitfinex no longer offers services to US customers, some Redditors reported trouble accessing Binance during the rally earlier this evening. Did you manage to snag some IOTA before the rally? Is IOTA poised to change the cryptocurrency world as we know it? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of CoinMarketCap and Pixabay.
bitcoinist	israeli-company-sued-for-misleading-crypto-mining-statements	Israeli Company Sued for Misleading Crypto Mining Statements - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-02T07:45	An Israeli shell company, Apollo Power, had its stocks soar after revealing that they had harnessed solar power for crypto mining. However, such claims turned out to be exaggerated, and they are now being sued. One of the most intriguing debates about cryptocurrency is the power used in mining and for transactions. Some have said that the total power consumption used by Bitcoin miners is more than the total of 19 European countries. Then there’s the fact that most of Bitcoin mining occurs in China, which uses coal to fuel their power plants. Such issues are why people are looking very hard for ways to reduce power consumption when mining cryptocurrencies. It seemed that a solution had appeared when an Israeli company said that they had completed a successful experiment using solar power for crypto mining. However, the company is now being sued as such a claim is being labeled as misleading. Harnessing the Sun for Crypto Mining The whole ruckus began when Apollo Power, based in Tel Aviv, made a filing to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in mid-December. In that filing, they said that the company had just completed a successful experiment where they used solar power for mining cryptocurrency. The result was that their stock immediately shot up in value. It went from $10.7 million in value to $14.9 million. People were excited as Apollo Power said that they had achieved a technological breakthrough. The company also said that they had filed a patent with US authorities for a modular solar system that contained a built-in crypto mining component. A win-win for the environment and for crypto miners. But Wait Just a Minute The euphoria and increased stock value were short-lived. Later in the day, just before the market closed, Apollo Power filed a second document. This was due to the Israeli securities authority asking for further clarification on this “technological breakthrough” that would energize cryptocurrency mining. The second document revealed the truth. The test that Apollo Power conducted lasted for 30 minutes, and the total amount of crypto mined was 0.00054 ETH. This boils down to a whopping 4 cents. The net result of an entire year of mining using the solar power technology would only equate to $130. Another tidbit in the document was that the power generated by the solar unit was not enough to mine bitcoins. The Horror of FOMO Once the updated news got out, the company’s stock value fell down to $10 million. One investor in the stock, Eli Buchris, has sued, stating that Apollo Power filed a report that was “partial, misleading, false, deceitful, and at the very least negligent.” Buchris maintains that the first filing was done to convince investors into buying the company’s stock. It does look like this is a pretty open-and-shut case. Situations like this show how FOMO (fear of missing out) works. Some major news hits the wires, causing people to begin investing their money to beat the rush and to cash in on the new thing. Far too often, such spectacular announcements turn out to be too good to be true. This fear is compounded with crypto as people have endlessly heard about those who bought into virtual currency early on and are now millionaires. Fortunately for many individuals, Apollo Power was forced to provide more concrete details to regulatory authorities. As always, one should always do as much research possible before investing and never forget the old adage of “buyer, beware!”. Do you think solar power can eventually be harnessed to mine cryptocurrency? Would you have bought shares in Apollo Power right off the bat after they made their first announcement? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	january-crypto-crash-nothing-new	5 Reasons Why January's Price Slump is Nothing to Worry About - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-18T06:00	With more people entering the crypto markets than ever before, the seeds of fear, uncertainty, and doubt has a greater impact on price volatility. Newbie traders jumping in and out on the whims of social media hype, and then panic selling, causes what happened over the past couple of days. However, looking at historical crypto charts, this January dip is nothing new. There are a number of reasons why the markets crash in January, and many originate in Asia where the bulk of crypto trading occurs. According to Coinmarketcap, which no longer includes South Korean exchanges, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies fell from $750 billion to $420 billion in four days. At the time of writing, they have since recovered and are on the way back up again, currently sitting at a total of $575 billion. FUD vs FOMO Reason #1: A lot of the impetus for crypto price action comes from Asia where the news has not been good in recent weeks. China is constantly trying to quash the entire industry, and South Korea just can’t make its mind up with regulatory hype and clampdown fearmongering emerging on an almost weekly basis. The FUD is as infectious as the FOMO, and panic selling over the past few days has sent all coins into freefall, with some losing as much as 40%. Looking back on historical Bitcoin charts reveals that a January selloff has happened before, several times in fact. Bitcoin is the gold standard for crypto, and a lot of the altcoins did not even exist back then. Crash Catalysts Reason #2: It has been speculated that one factor causing this is the Chinese Lunar New Year, which usually falls in February. It is a time of year when people take time off work and travel to visit family, and for this, they will need fiat, not crypto. Since nations in Asia are responsible for the lion’s share of crypto trading, it stands to reason that this could contribute to the annual selloff. Reason #3: Another factor could be the end of the tax year approaching where investors are planning to pay their annual taxes. Again this has to be done in fiat, not crypto. While not the only catalyst, it could have some influence over price action. Reason #4: The ending of the first ever Bitcoin futures contract may also have contributed to traders shorting the asset. Once the big players, such as CBOE and CME, get involved, smaller markets can be manipulated by the institutionalized investors, and we could see more of this action until things stabilize. Reason #5: As more new and inexperienced traders enter the market, these chart oscillations will amplify. Only when they realize that this is a natural cycle and crypto is not dead will things settle down a little. Since total market investment in cryptocurrencies has jumped over 2500% in less than a year, we are still at very early stages of what could be a game changing industry. Did you panic sell your crypto or hodl it? Share your experiences below. Images courtesy of CoinMarketCap, Bitcoinist archives, and Pixabay.
bitcoinist	japan-legal-bitcoin-ny-bitlicense	Japan's New Bitcoin Law Could Do More Damage Than NY BitLicense	2017-04-01T09:00	According to IndieSquare Co-founder Koji Higashi, new regulations in Japan, which will make Bitcoin an official form of payment (starting today April 1), may do more harm than good for the fledgling industry in the country. Japan to Introduce Own ‘Bitlicense’ Following the disastrous demise of the infamous Japanese exchange, Mt. Gox and the arrest of its CEO Mark Karpelès, regulators in the country decided to introduce regulations for Bitcoin. The regulatory framework has been in the works for over two years. The first bill was submitted to the Diet in Japan (the legislature consisting of the Lower and the Upper Houses) last March, and the Payment Services Act and the Act on Preventing of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds were amended in May 2016. Now, new drafts for detailed regulations and guidelines have been approved. The new law, which is now in place starting today (April 1), is meant to protect consumers and to help them distinguish safe, i.e. approved exchanges, from fraudulent operations. The law also recognizes approved cryptocurrencies as a legal method of payment in Japan, preventing users from investing in so-called scam coins, fake digital assets, and IOU tokens. Although praised by western and Japanese media alike, the new regulatory framework may pose serious problems for the Japanese Bitcoin community, according to Koji Higashi, Co-Founder of IndieSquare and Community Director at the Counterparty Foundation. In a blog post, Higashi outlines the major issues with what he calls “Japan’s Bitlicense” due to the similarities found between the two, saying: I’d actually argue that this law may turn out to be more damaging to the Japanese industry in the long run than what Bitlicense has been to NY. Why It Could Be Worse Than NY’s The Bitlicense introduced in New York has been widely perceived by the community as damaging for Bitcoin startups in the region due to the bureaucracy and high entry barriers for small startups. It resulted in several startups like ShapeShift and LocalBitcoins halting services for NY-based customers. Now, Japan is doing the same, explains Higashi. “If you are not a fan of the excessive cost for legal and compliance fee for Bitcoin startups, however, the new law in Japan is certainly not exciting news for you,” he notes. Among others, the requirements involve the submission of a 3-year business plan, segregated fund management, KYC/AML requirements, segregated fund management, frequent reporting to authority, and external audits. Some experts estimate that the costs involved with becoming a compliant exchange could be as high as $300,000-$500,000 USD. Moreover, additional fees and paperwork will also apply to companies beyond trading platforms and will affect P2P decentralized exchanges as well. Higashi: It’s hard to say whether the regulation in Japan is more costly than the Bitlicense but I can say it’s expensive enough to put serious financial pressure on startups and may force them to go out of business completely in some cases. Another issue with the new regulatory framework is that it will require virtual currencies to be accepted into an official list of approved coins. Although this system may protect users from being scammed out of their savings, it may end up damaging the reputation of coins that don’t make it to the list, which will most likely be a conservative one at best. Bitcoin in Japan The new regulations may affect Bitcoin startups negatively but are also likely to push adoption forward and to create a sense of trust for new users in the virtual currency space. Japan is the fastest growing country in the Bitcoin market. For example, trading volume in Japan has recently surpassed that of China and the U.S. The country is experiencing growing interest in Bitcoin from users, investors, and merchants. Blockchain is also a technological focus point both for companies and the government. The Japanese community is also one of the biggest investors in crypto-related crowdfunding campaigns and Initial Coin Offerings, according to Higashi. [Note: This article was originally published on February 9, 2017. It has been updated as today (April 1) is the first day Japan’s new cryptocurrency law comes into effect.] Will the new regulations drive companies away from Japan? Or will it usher a new age for cryptocurrency adoption in the country? Images courtesy of CryptoCompare, Shutterstock, Counterparty.io
bitcoinist	japans-largest-financial-group-launch-virtual-currency	Japan's Largest Financial Group To Launch Own Virtual Currency - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-16T14:30	Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) is launching an initiative to open a new exchange and issue its own virtual currency: the “MUFG coin.” By controlling the exchanges themselves, MUFG plan to suppress fluctuations in the price of MUFG coins in order that they can be used stably for settlement and remittance. The MUFG coin, due to their distribution being made available on a centralized exchange, can be directly overseen by the bank. In addition, the bank can also control the value of the coin, which is aiming to be worth approximately 1 yen. Users can then use these coins, accessed from their smartphones, to pay for goods and services in a secure fashion. MUFG is aiming to increase adoption with suppliers and retailers throughout Japan for the payment platform and is aiming to launch later in the year. The move demonstrates how cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech are slowly being realized by traditional financial institutions, who are eager to benefit from the reduced operational costs that virtual currencies can offer. Legislative Hurdles and Financial Regulation MUFG has already notified the Financial Services Agency on their plans to issue coins and open an exchange. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ will make full preparations for the MUFG coins issuance, with plans to organize contests to generate ideas for business usage of the MUFG coins in March. In order to establish a virtual currency exchange in Japan, it is obligatory to register with the Financial Services Agency, and there are still some hurdles left. As the Fintech industry continues to grow, further legislation for responding to new services like MUFG will continue to be developed in the country. Bitcoinist previously looked at the state of the Fintech industry in Japan here. Online Responses To The MUFG coin Announcement Users took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the upcoming coin launch. They were quick to point out that the MUFG coin is not OMG and that the price is to be capped at 1 yen per coin. Mainichi Shimbun: Japan's largest bank, MUFG, is *planning* on launching a #cryptocurrency exchange. Even the largest bank of the country can no longer ignore the exponentially increasing demand for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) January 15, 2018 It's not related to $OMG. We Japanese don't take it seriously. I think MUFG Coin will fail. Nobody is gonna use it. — ヒロ(Blockchain Hero) (@btc883n) January 15, 2018 This is a MUFG coin by Mitsubishi Bank Japan. The value is ¥1 = 1UFJ coin. It has nothing to do with J-coin or OMG. Just like to clarify this to Crypto enthusiast outside of Japan. The government will regulate the coin so it won't be more than ¥1 / coin. — Edward (@ETHtrenpreneur) January 15, 2018 The Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo, is Japan’s largest financial group and is the 2nd largest bank holding company in the world, holding around $1.8 trillion USD. Will we see increasing cryptocurrecy initiatives such as this, with centralized banking controls? Do they offer the same degree of security as other decentralized cryptocurrencies?

bitcoinist	jpmorgan-suffers-whiplash-say-bitcoin-new-gold	JPMorgan Suffers Whiplash as They Say Bitcoin Could be the New Gold - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-05T03:00	A strategist at JPMorgan Chase now says that Bitcoin could be a legitimate asset like gold even though CEO Jamie Dimon rips into the cryptocurrency. Will JPMorgan suffer whiplash from this constant back-and-forth? Is there a doctor in the house? We could use one as JPMorgan Chase once again does an about-face concerning Bitcoin, which may lead to a case of whiplash. The banking and financial services giant has a dubious history with the popular cryptocurrency, mainly due to their CEO, Jamie Dimon, who has publicly and repeatedly lashed out at Bitcoin while praising the underlying blockchain technology. Now one of their strategists says that Bitcoin could be the new gold and be a legitimate asset. Going Back and Forth A global markets strategist at JPMorgan Chase, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, recently issued a report that painted a far warmer picture of Bitcoin than the company’s CEO. The fact that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has approved the launch of Bitcoin futures trading for CME and the Cboe Futures Exchange puts the status of the digital currency in a new light. In his report, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou says: The prospective launch of bitcoin futures contracts by established exchanges in particular has the potential to add legitimacy and thus increase the appeal of the cryptocurrency market to both retail and institutional investors. Panigirtzoglou goes on to add: In all, the prospective introduction of bitcoin futures has the potential to elevate cryptocurrencies to an emerging asset class. The value of this new asset class is a function of the breadth of its acceptance as a store of wealth and as a means of payment and simply judging by other stores of wealth such as gold, cryptocurrencies have the potential to grow further from here. All This Pivoting Makes My Neck Hurt The flip-flopping between the various personalities at JPMorgan is enough to give anybody whiplash. We now have one of their strategists touting Bitcoin, and the company has been actively involved in blockchain technology for quite some time. They began work on Quorum, their open-source transaction network for data privacy, back in 2015. JPMorgan Chase is also a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and recently went into partnership with the developers of Zcash. Yet Jamie Dimon, their CEO, absolutely loathes Bitcoin, calling it a fraud. Back in 2016 at the World Economic Forum, Dimon said : Bitcoin the currency, I think, is going to go nowhere. And it’s not because of anything to do with the technology. Governments, when they form themselves, form their currency. Governments like to control currency, know where it goes, and who it goes to, and control it for monetary purposes. There is nothing behind a Bitcoin, and I think if it was big, the governments would stop it. I mean that’s my own personal belief, I may be dead wrong. This last September, Jamie Dimon once again ripped into Bitcoin, saying: Who cares about bitcoin? The world economy’s so big, JPMorgan alone, $6 trillion, we move all this money, and bitcoin in total, all these currencies, $50 billion dollars, maybe a billion dollars trades a day. It’s almost like JPMorgan is Jekyll and Hyde. The company is banking on the blockchain while their CEO continually badmouths the cryptocurrency that helped bring the technology into the limelight. I’m surprised that they don’t have an in-house doctor to treat all the whiplash that must be going on. What do you think about JPMorgan’s various stances on Bitcoin?

bitcoinist	katy-perry-showcases-her-crypto-claws	Katy Perry Showcases Her Crypto Claws - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-26T07:00	Katy Perry is the latest celebrity to jump on the cryptocurrency bandwagon, recently posting an image of her crypto-inspired nails. You know a particular thing has hit the mainstream when you see celebrities flocking to be associated with it. In their never-ending quest to stay in the public eye and remain relevant, they’ll glom onto the latest trends and hold on for dear life. The latest example is Katy Perry, who has definitely jumped onto the Bitcoin and digital currency bandwagon. She recently posted an Instagram image of her cryptocurrency-themed nails. A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Jan 25, 2018 at 12:49am PST Bitcoin Going Hollywood In her Instagram post that’s captioned “$—CrYpTo ClAwS—$,” Katy Perry sports some eye-catching fingernails. Her nails are embossed with the symbols of some of the most popular cryptocurrencies out there. Naturally enough, we see Bitcoin taking center stage on one hand. Her thumbs boast the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency, and her remaining digits feature the likes of Litecoin, Stellar, and Monero. This isn’t the first time Perry has flirted with cryptocurrency. Back in November 2017, she posted an image of her talking to investor Warren Buffett. In the post, she says that she’s asking Buffett his thoughts on cryptocurrency. (Hopefully, she did not follow his advice.) Celebrities and Crypto However, Katy Perry is certainly not the first celebrity to jump on board the crypto bandwagon, and she definitely won’t be the last. Floyd Mayweather was one of the first celebs to tout crypto by hyping the Stox ICO. He later pushed digital currencies by posting an image of him holding a Titanian Centra debit card, which is a card for various cryptocurrencies, while in an upscale shoe store. Spending bitcoins ethereum and other types of cryptocurrency in Beverly Hill https://t.co/q9VZ3MzpK8 pic.twitter.com/BYyOFUnm8W — Floyd Mayweather (@FloydMayweather) September 15, 2017 The saddest case of a celebrity tying themselves to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is Paris Hilton. She hyped the ICO of a marketing platform called LydianCoin. However, she quickly deleted any endorsements after people pointed out that the person behind the project had been convicted of domestic assault. Chances are that we’ll continue to see celebrities pushing themselves onto the crypto scene. Some may have a legitimate interest, but the majority will probably be doing it for the publicity. However, one wonders how many crypto projects will pay for celebrity endorsements in the future. ICOs raise a ton of cash, some of which could be used to hire a famous spokesperson. What do you think about Perry’s crypto claws? Will we see more celebrity endorsements of cryptocurrency in the future? Let us know in the comments below.

However, as distrust is built, they were able to get Dan Metclaf to review the code for their anonymous implementation. Dan currently works in XCurrency which, as KeyCoin, tries to bring privacy for all of those who use it. He is also a consultant at ATC Corportation. Dan had been approached by the development of KeyCoin so that he could review the code, and prove to the community that the code was in fact as advertised, and that it would work once released. This was a great move by the entire KeyCoin team as it builds trust among their community which is a very important aspect in any altcoin. Here, the short review by Dan at the bitcointalk thread. You can find the entire post here : The Actual Code: “KEY is 100% Proof-of-Stake, with checkpoints, active POS checkpointing server, and a POS Maximum Age of 120 days to prevent long term accumulation attacks. The code has been well audited by both members of the community and exchange operators.Key’s anonymous solution is an unique hybrid which leverages on-demand encryption and clustered pools to randomize mixing. To prevent leakage the transaction is passed through the clustered mixing pools twice, thus rendering the transaction untraceable on the blockchain and also prevents even the sender from tracing the transaction on the block chain. While the anonymous system is indeed based on XC, it is a highly modified and unique version.” Peer Review “In reviewing the code, I did a basic review of the entire code base and a more in-depth analysis of the anonymous related portions.The additional clustering abilities within the protocol itself provide an ideal solution in preventing block analysis, and to take it even 1 step further, the developers have implemented a ring layer on the protocol allowing the transaction to take multiple pass’s through the cluster, further anonymizing the transaction.Since the entire protocol including the enhancements are encrypted it is impossible to gain any information by sniffing the network.The protocol enhancements have been integrated correctly and based on my own testing perform as expected and haven’t created any security vulnerabilities.” Personally, I found this action by the developers to be incredible as they were able to build upon the basis they had established with regards to the coin itself. They are able to calm down the community, and show that what they have been doing is completely real. This is something we do not see everyday. Most coins die due to a lack of communication by the developers which ultimately causes distrust by the community. A characteristic which is not good to see present in any coin. Ultimately, this definitely builds some trust to be shown towards KeyCoin. Yet, it does not assure us that what has been promised will be delivered. We must still wait and see how KeyCoin shows its anonymous implementation. It should be an exciting few days in KeyCoin, and hopefully they deliver on what they have said.

bitcoinist	kraken-continues-ma-cryptowatch	Kraken Continues M&A Spree: Acquires Cryptowatch Charting Platform	2017-03-01T13:00	Kraken has acquired charting platform Cryptowatch in an effort to improve its interface and cryptocurrency trading experience. Kraken Snatches Cryptowatch San Fransisco based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has announced the acquisition of Cryptowatch, a popular charting and trading platform to improve its own trading platform. The latest move by Kraken will allow clients to have direct access to an upgraded Cryptowatch trading interface through the Kraken platform itself, introducing users to a tool that is already used by thousands of traders online. Instructions on how to use the trading interface can be found here. Cryptowatch, whose user-base has increased by roughly 700% during the last two years, is used by thousands of traders online and provides data for over 150 currency pairs and 22 digital assets. The platform was founded in January 2014 by Artur Sapek who will continue to oversee its development as part of the Kraken team. “In just 2 years Cryptowatch grew into one of the pillars of the digital asset trading community,” said Sapek. “Teaming up with an exchange was the natural next step, and Kraken was my first choice.” Kraken CEO Jesse Powell added: As the industry’s leading charting tool for traders, we plan to devote more resources and talent to further enhance its offering. And we’ve purposed the technology to provide a great new charting and trading platform to Kraken clients as the first step in improving our own interface. Merger & Acquisitions Galore This is only the latest in a series of landmark M&A deals for Kraken, which also includes CleverCoin, Cavirtex and Coinsetter acquired last year. The latter enabled the exchange to expand into the U.S. and Canada. In December, Kraken also acquired wallet provider Glidera. Moreover, last May, Kraken announced it would be the first and only exchange enabling clients to use the (ETH) Dark Pool Trading, allowing users to “discreetly” place large trading orders without exposing the order book to the public. Kraken was also the first cryptocurrency exchange to pass a cryptographically verifiable proof-of-reserves audit. In December, Kraken partnered with The Economist to provide an answer to one of the most frequently asked question in the cryptocurrency investment space (Bitcoin, Ether or Both?) through a competition that was held between thirteen participating teams from various MBA (Master of Business Administration) programs around the world.

bitcoinist	kyc-legal-founder-we-are-creating-a-global-universal-personal-identification-alternative	KYC.Legal Founder: 'We are Creating a Global Universal Personal Identification Alternative' - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-21T14:45	Daniil Rausov, the founder of KYC.Legal, sits down with Bitcoinist to discuss his company’s unique service, the similarities between its business model and Uber, and the client verification procedures designed to make life easier for all market participants. Bitcoinist: For starters, tell us about KYC.Legal? What makes this a unique product on the market? How is it convenient for the client? DR: In short, this is a simple and quick way to complete client identification procedures, which can then be used to verify the client’s identity during various financial operations (so-called KYC (“know your customer”) requirements that financial institutions and companies working with the money of private individuals use to identify and verify counterparties before starting a financial transaction – author’s note ). Our product is the base program that makes it possible for a client to enter his or her details, while we use various automated methods to check them. Bitcoinist: In essence, you are creating a sort of universal global alternative to personal IDs? DR: Yes, that is exactly it. Bitcoinist: You have said that a person could enter any of his or her information. What if this information is knowingly false? How will you verify it? DR: In the second stage of our check, the client is visited by an agent, who confirms that the client was the one who entered the information. The agent checks that he or she is a real living person, and is the person in the photograph on the identification document. This allows us to achieve the greatest possible level of credibility and legitimacy for work with all businesses around the world. Bitcoinist: Let’s imagine a situation: a courier comes to your client, looks at his or her passport, but the documents provided by the person turn out to be fake. How can this be checked? DR: Of course, the agent that visited the person cannot check whether or not the documents are fake. A bank can’t do so either. That check is performed by the police or the specialized state agencies authorized to do so. In our case, we involve all possible services available on the market today and help to check the information. Bitcoinist: What does a person need to do to use your service? DR: All one has to do is download the app and enter their information. The application consists of two parts. The first part is self-verification, where the user independently enters his or her information. The second is full verification, with a visit from an agent. After completing the procedure, the user receives a notification that he or she has passed our verification procedure, and this information will be accepted by all the structures with which we work, from banks to pharmacies, which can issue prescriptions remotely for those who have received our verification. At the request of the various services, we can also perform additional checks. Bitcoinist: And who are these agents who perform the verification procedures? How do you work with them? DR: We do not have full-time employees who work as agents. They are just people who have some free time, who can earn some money by going to the house next door to verify a user for us. Our company will verify all of our couriers, so that we can trust them to verify our clients. Bitcoinist: So, your service runs on a business model similar to the one used by Uber. DR: Your comparison with Uber is very apropos. From day one we oriented ourselves on the Uber taxi business model. We created a model under which ordinary people can earn some money by performing certain actions. Bitcoinist: What information will the final decision on a person contain? Of course, you will have his or her age, name, and passport details. But what else? DR: Right now, we have just started the first stage: we enter a person’s name, surname, citizenship, address, and the information from his or her identification document. Later we will introduce certificates on education and all kinds of other documents that pertain to this person and can be verified. Bitcoinist: What about someone’s credit report? DR: We are prepared to compile “blacklists” for companies. If someone who has passed through our verification procedures subsequently gets into trouble, we will be able to provide this information to outside organizations. This will prevent this person from using certain services. Bitcoinist: Will it be possible to somehow get yourself taken off of a “blacklist”? DR: For our part, we can only enter the relevant information on a client. It is up to the corresponding services themselves to then decide whether or not to grant the person access to their products. It is the same as passing through AML (anti-money laundering– author’s note ) procedures: there are acceptable levels, and critical levels. Bitcoinist: What do you need to do to get “blacklisted”? DR: That depends on what the person does in the services that he or she is authorized to use through our system. Bitcoinist: Do you track the activities of your clients in any way? DR: That is the third stage of verification. We will add information to the initial data on a client, and during registration the services will be able to see what a person has got himself or herself involved in. By the way, if they wish credit organizations can also receive a person’s credit record from us, for example. We are currently developing this system. Bitcoinist: Are there, alternatively, any bonus points available to your clients? Say a person has used your KYC services, and he is an upstanding and conscientious client… DR: Our system works in two directions. We have only touched upon the negative side, but the positive aspect is the most important. For financial organizations, it is very important that a client has a positive record. This gives him or her the chance to receive additional bonuses in similar areas. Bitcoinist: Banks have a separate security service that performs client verification using a multi-stage verification system. How do you plan to check the good faith of your clients? DR: The first thing we do is to confirm the information entered by a person. We make sure that the information is accepted by the databases that have integrated with us. We can also use AML, which I mentioned earlier, or something similar like a secure care service to perform additional checks. This will increase the trust in our verified users. Bitcoinist: Let’s imagine another situation: a person has passed through the verification process, taken out a loan in a bank, and disappeared. The representatives of partner companies come to you and say: “You checked this person, and he disappeared. How do we find him?” What will you do in this case? DR: This situation is similar to the one that already exists and is in operation on the banking market. The mechanism for searching for a person and holding him accountable is the same. The client does not receive protection by hiding behind our application. We keep information on him. We have his name and surname, information from the bank that he worked with, the information from additional checks… When he ordered the agent verification service, he also made a payment, meaning that we have that information as well. If it comes to court proceedings, we will have enough information on the client to hold him accountable or to help the bank to get to the bottom of his case. Bitcoinist: Getting back to the security services of banks, do you plan to work with ordinary credit institutions instead of cryptobanks? DR: Yes, we do. We are currently negotiating on possible integration with a fairly large bank headquartered in Russia. We would like to simplify their client verification procedure because it fits with the mechanism used in our service. I think that banks will be interested in our service because it will cut the costs of this service considerably. For example, they will not need to engage an additional agent to perform the same functions as those offered by us. Bitcoinist: So, users will save time thanks to you and your business? DR: Of course! After all, it’s better for any service to accept a fully verified client, rather than occupying itself with external verification of a person, which requires additional time and money. Today, it is very important that a person can come and immediately use a service, without waiting weeks or even months for access. This is exactly what many are looking for, so we are tried to design everything to ensure that there would be no time delays. Bitcoinist: Are KYC principles different in different regions, or are they identical? DR: Each bank in each region uses its own criteria, and we try to unify them. We do everything to ensure the greatest possible verification of users, so that they not only have access to one local bank and one local service, but to all the advantages of these services. Bitcoinist: What are the target markets for your service? Are you targeting only America or only Russia? DR: Our service is universal. Our lawyers were tasked with preparing a solution that would make it possible for a user to work with services in different regions and in various countries. Thanks to the analysis performed by our lawyers, we have created a solution that is suitable for work in the majority of developed countries. Bitcoinist: In other words, if I, say, passed through verification in Russia, and then moved to America, I could use your service there as well? DR: Yes, of course, By granting you access to our service, we confirm your identity, and the fact that your documents have been properly registered and checked. If necessary, we can perform additional checks based on specific criteria for each region. Bitcoinist: Will you do this for individual regions, or at the request of businesses? DR: At the request of specific businesses. Say there is a financial institution that works with clients in different regions, and they have certain requirements for each region. We will use universal solutions that allow a person to be checked. But only after the AML check has been completed. The solution is integrated with all of our partners who use our service. Bitcoinist: What areas of business are you focusing on in terms of partnership and the use of your product? DR: We work with brokerage services, with microcredit organizations, and with funds that work with institutional cryptoasset buyers. Negotiations are also currently underway with two cryptoexchanges. We have also started negotiating with the companies acting as a link between banks and exchanges. Bitcoinist: Will it be possible to use KYC.Legal to buy a plane ticket, for example, in the not-so-distant future? DR: I think that will be possible. That is one of our areas of activity, the purchase of tickets and insurance services. We are already establishing relations with various companies working in this area. Bitcoinist: Why did you decide to hold an ICO for your project, and to use blockchain for its implementation? DR: Our solution can only be implemented if the data that we use for verification cannot be hacked. Blockchain has made this possible. If it wasn’t for blockchain, the data would be stored on some server, which could be hacked both in theory and in practice. Therefore, the trust in these data would be minimal. Bitcoinist: What can be used to pay for your services, and how? DR: The services will be paid after the agent is called using an ordinary bank card or PayPal. That is what will subsequently be used to identify payments. Bitcoinist: Do you already have an idea what you plan to charge for your services? DR: At present, the cost of the full verification procedure using an agent is from $10 to $50. Bitcoinist: Why such a broad range? On what does it depend? DR: The cost of the agent’s visit depends on the region. For example, in Eastern Europe the cost of a courier starts at EUR 10, in Asia and India it is slightly higher, in Russia it is RUB 500-600, and in the USA, which has the highest priced labor, the cost might reach $50. Bitcoinist: Returning to the Uber business model on the market of banking products and services. What other banking services do you think may be outsourced in the future? DR: An enormous number of these services will appear, making it possible for someone to put their abilities to use and work independently. This is a huge market, and it continues to grow, which is why I am sure that many businesses will be able to use this solution. Do you think that KYC.Legal will replace current KYC measures? How does KYC.Legal improve on current offerings? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of KYC.Legal
bitcoinist	lawyers-moving-into-the-bitcoin-space	Lawyers Moving Into the Bitcoin Space - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T16:00	Many law firms are rapidly adapting to the business environment that Bitcoin technology offers. As a result, these law firms, as well as independent lawyers, are increasingly accepting payments in Bitcoin for legal services. Law Firms Are Adapting to the Crypto Environment Many law firms are accepting Bitcoin as payment because customers request it. Others are accepting Bitcoin because they fear missing out on the opportunities that the new business environment promises. As Law.com reports, Carol Van Cleef, a Washington DC lawyer, who for many years has been representing clients involved in cryptocurrency businesses but has not been accepting payments in Bitcoin, clearly conveys this sentiment when she says: I’ve known for a long time that my opportunity to expand in certain areas has been affected by not taking it. On the other hand, some law firms that have been involved in cases involving Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency businesses have already been accepting the cryptocurrency for many years. For example, in May 2014, New York-based McLaughlin & Stern, one of the oldest U.S. law firms, established in 1898, become the first major U.S. legal practice to start accepting payments in Bitcoin. The trend of accepting payments in cryptocurrency is now gaining momentum and expanding to a wide range of law firms, including solo attorneys. John Wagster discusses how "More Law Firms Are Accepting #Bitcoin Payments" with @BloombergLaw #blockchain https://t.co/ex7jJm7XL7 — Frost Brown Todd (@FBT_law) September 7, 2017 Some law firms such as Frost Brown Todd accept bitcoin to demonstrate their commitment to their clients working in the crypto space. Frost Brown Todd advises clients launching Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and establishing hedge funds specializing in cryptocurrency assets. International Law Firms Accept Payments in Bitcoin Lawyers that undertake international assignments find that Bitcoin can significantly facilitate cross-border payment transactions because Bitcoin facilitates remote confirmation of transactions. Moreover, Bitcoin offers low transfer fees, transparency in real time, fast settlements, and the execution of cryptographically-secured transactions. In this regard, Nordic Law, after receiving requests from its foreign clients, started to offer these clients the option to pay in the cryptocurrency in October 2017. Nordic Law’s press release explains : In our view, all relevant actors, including law firms, must adapt to the new business environments, wherein virtual currencies have a continuously growing significance. Interest in Bitcoin and its technology continues to grow among law firms, lawyers, and academics. As result, a group of lawyers founded the Digital Currency and Ledger Defense Coalition (DCLDC), whose mission is to foster innovation in these technologies. According to their website: The DCLCD was founded to help protect individual constitutional rights and civil liberties in connection with regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny and efforts relating to digital currencies (e.g., bitcoin) and ledgers (e.g., blockchains). Bitcoin’s growth will most likely continue to encourage clients to request lawyers and law firms to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment for legal services. Do you think foreign clients will continue to push law firms to accept payments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Let us know in the comment section below. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Images courtesy of Pixabay, Twitter
bitcoinist	legal-investor-sec-statement-ico	Legal Experts: Investors May View SEC’s Statement as Validating ICO's - Bitcoinist.com	2017-08-02T08:00	Bitcoinist decided to dig deeper into the SEC’s newly issued guidance on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and its implications for investors. We chatted with three legal experts, namely Alfredo Silva, Joshua Ashley Klayman and Daniel Kahan. Joshua Klayman is a founding member and the head of MoFo’s Blockchain + Smart Contracts Group. Her practice focuses on finance and corporate matters including advising on leveraged finance transactions, commercial transactions, and corporate governance matters. Daniel Kahan is an Emerging Companies and Venture Capital lawyer and a member of MoFo’s Blockchain + Smart Contracts Group. His corporate transactional practice focuses on venture capital and private equity investments, as well as strategic technology transactions. Alfredo Silva is a securities lawyer and a partner in the Corporate Group. He represents public and private companies and investors in a broad range of corporate and securities law matters, including compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws. SEC Says ‘The DAO’ Token is a Security, But What Else? Bitcoinist: Unsurprisingly, SEC’s guidance specifically deemed The DAO tokens to be securities. However, it did hint that other tokens could be as well. Is this solely determined by the Howey test? Alfredo Silva: No. The basic definition of a “security” set forth in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), is very broad in scope, covering a number specific instruments, like stock, bonds and options, as well as any “investment contract.” The Howey test, first articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1946 and refined by subsequent case law over the years, is intended to help understand what “investment contract” means where there is doubt or question. When we talk about the Howey test, we’re referring collectively to the original Supreme Court case as well as an entire line of subsequent court cases and guidance by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in applying the Howey test when interpreting Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act. Some have expressed surprise that the logic first set down in a 71-year-old court case is now central to the discussion in determining whether novel instruments like digital tokens fall under regulation by the Securities Act. However, Howey is an oldie, but a goodie – the Court recognized the inevitability of innovation in financial transactions, so it articulated a test that is intentionally designed to look to the underlying substance of any given instrument, not the form or the name. That means that even though digital tokens currently are not specifically named as one of the clear categories of securities expressly defined as securities under the Securities Act, the facts and circumstances analysis under Howey means that some digital tokens that look like “investment contracts” may be securities. That said, there are other tests for whether an instrument is a security. For example, in its 1990 decision in Reves v. Ernst & Young, the Supreme Court adopted the so-called “family resemblance” test, articulating four factors to determine whether an instrument classified as a “note,” one of the explicitly named categories of security under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act. This test included consideration of the parties’ motivation for entering into the transaction, whether there was a trading market for investment in the instrument, the expectations of the investing public, and whether there were other regulatory schemes applicable to instrument that could reduce risk to the buyer. Interestingly, the Supreme Court subsequently held that even if an instrument did not qualify as a named type of security under the family resemblance test, it still might qualify as an “investment contract” under Howey. In addition, the states and certain territories each have their own securities regimes, called “Blue Sky” laws, which often mirror federal securities laws in many, but not all, ways. The definition of “security” under Section 25109 of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, for example, is clearly derived from the definition in the Securities Act. However, in interpreting its definition of “security,” courts in California and a number of other states have adopted both the Howey test and a “risk capital” test. This latter test focuses more on an investor’s potential losses than potential gains, and is therefore broader than the Howey test. Bitcoinist: “The Howey test is highly fact-specific. Not all tokens are securities,” explained attorney Marco Santori. What kind of token would absolutely be a security? What type of token wouldn’t? App-tokens? Pre-functional utility tokens? Private currency tokens? Use-or-lose tokens? Where do you think the line will be drawn by the SEC in your opinion? Alfredo Silva: While many people refer to certain token types by category name, as if they are well-established, static categories, it is important to remember that the digital token market is still in its relative infancy and there is not yet a uniform market understanding of or agreement on what those various terms mean. There’s no Platonic ideal of an “app token,” and there’s no set of standard characteristics that distinguishes one “category” of tokens from another – the white papers on the tokens are vague and inconsistent, the categories can blend together and overlap, and new token types are continually being developed and proposed. In contrast, for example, when we talk about “common stock” versus “preferred stock” of a startup, whether we are referring to that of a Delaware, California, Washington or Texas corporation, we still understand what rights typically attach to each because the laws and markets of the major U.S. states have over decades settled at roughly the same terms, with minor distinctions at the margins. If there were clearly defined and long-established token categories, then perhaps the SEC would have provided specific guidance by category. Although it should be noted that the SEC Report in fact left open the question of whether any tokens are not securities, we can apply the analysis laid out in Howey and Reves to help consider whether the SEC might be more likely to categorize any given token as a security. Tokens that look more like stock, bonds and other traditional securities – tokens that entitle the buyer to profit share or specified or potential investment returns based on the business operations of the issuer, or where there is great pressure to buy quickly to get into a good deal or lose the potential for return later – are more likely to be classified as securities. On the other hand, tokens that have some intrinsic value and use to the buyer at the time of issuance and aren’t necessarily intended to be resold or redeemed for greater cash value may look less like securities and more like assets. Ultimately these are shades on a spectrum, and we cannot go beyond that to say that a token type that looks less like a security will not ultimately be deemed to be a security. In the absence of on-point SEC guidance (such as no-action letters, rule making, etc.), we cannot be sure or offer certainty as to any specific token. For these reasons, additional clarity is being sought from the SEC by issuers, legal advisors and others. For example, in May of this year, Ouisa Capital, an SEC- and FINRA-registered broker-dealer that operates an alternative trading system (“ATS”) using blockchain technology, filed with the SEC a petition for rulemaking, requesting that the SEC provide a concept release, as well as potential rules regulating digital tokens and distributed ledger technology generally. The petition also requested the SEC to consider adopting a “regulatory sandbox” (akin to what is being used in certain other countries, such as the United Kingdom) with respect to such regulation. Bitcoinist: Let’s say a token fails the Howey test – could it still be considered a security in some cases? Why? Alfredo Silva: There are two problems with trying to just rely on the Howey test to determine that a token would not be considered a security. First, you can only get a definitive confirmation of how the Howey test applies to a given instrument one way or the other through litigation or an enforcement action – even a no action letter isn’t completely determinative. Proving a negative is always a challenge, no matter the question, and the determination regarding whether a given token is not a security is no different. Second, as discussed above, even if Howey might suggest a token is not an investment contract, the Reves “family resemblance” test might suggest a token is another type of security, and other existing or future U.S. federal case law or guidance may also apply. Further, issuers must comply with state Blue Sky laws as well – even a token that would not be regulated by the SEC may be regulated by one or more of the states in which it is issued or sold. Bitcoinist: Though the SEC called it a currency, can Ethereum be considered a security considering they had their own ICO a few years ago? Dan Kahan: Certainly investment contracts that are based on Ethereum, like swaps or futures contracts, could be considered a security. Similarly, groups that raise funds to make investments in Ethereum could be issuing securities. Ether tokens themselves, while traded and the subject of much investment and many investment contracts, are primarily designed to power the Ethereum blockchain, and in many ways function and look more like a commodity, like oil, than like a traditional security. Yet, as noted earlier, given the early stage of the digital token market and token offerings generally, and the lack of bright-line guidance from the SEC and others, it’s not presently possible to say with certainty whether any token other than The DAO token is or is not a security. Bitcoinist: Mr. Silva reacted to the SEC guidance stating that even foreign-based platforms dealing in cryptocurrencies “must register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption.” What key steps must these platforms take to get an exemption? Josh Klayman: To be clear, this is a quirk of the way U.S. federal laws are written: they generally apply to everyone in the world, with exceptions being available to the extent the person or organization in question doesn’t actually deal in the United States or with U.S. persons or issuers. The key question is: is the exchange truly a foreign exchange, or does it market into the United States or deal with U.S. persons? This question can be difficult to answer given how many token exchanges operate. The larger point that we’re trying to make here is that going “offshore” is not always a solution if U.S. persons can purchase in an offering or if there is potential for post-issuance trading of the securities to persons in the United States. Also, it’s important to realize that the definition of “U.S. person” under Regulation S of the Securities Act (“Regulation S”) is a broad one and is not limited, for example, to U.S. citizens. As we understand it, some issuers had been launching digital token offerings outside the United States with the belief that, so long as a token was not classified as a security in the jurisdiction of its issuance, there was no need to comply with securities laws of other countries, including the United States. The SEC’s recent guidance makes clear what we had long suspected to be the case: The DAO ran afoul of U.S. securities laws despite the fact that it was operated outside the United States. The application of U.S. securities laws to non-U.S. issuers is not a new phenomenon and lawyers who deal with cross-border transactions encounter these issues regularly. Bitcoinist: Argon Group general counsel Emma Channing suggested that Regulation D’s Rule 506(c), which allows general solicitation on a private offering, provides an exemption for ICOs. Could you expand on this? Dan Kahan: Rule 506(c) under Regulation D of the Securities Act (“Regulation D”) is one of many potential safe harbors that may apply to a securities issuance. It allows for issuers to market and make a securities offering known to the public, but it doesn’t allow for indiscriminate sales to the public – the investors who participate still must be “accredited investors” within the meaning of Rule 501 under Regulation D based on the investors’ income or net worth, and the issuer must take reasonable steps to verify this. Accordingly, this is not a true crowdfunding rule. In fact, it’s quite the opposite and is often relied upon for the sale of preferred stock in traditional venture capital financings. Essentially, using Rule 506(c) to conduct an ICO means selling tokens in much the same way an issuer would sell stock in a private financing (i.e., to “accredited investors” and not to the general public), while permitting some public disclosure of the offering Bitcoinist: How does this guidance impact the current ICO landscape? Former Bitcoin Foundation chairman Jon Matonis stated that it “reduces the overall pool of offerings and increased the prospects for the non-US ICOs.” Would you agree? Alfredo Silva: In the short term, this may well cause some token issuers to seek to conduct their token offerings entirely outside the United States. However, issuers that were paying attention to compliance with the legal requirements around tokens before this announcement often already knew, or should have known, that certain tokens should properly have been treated as securities, and either chose to conduct such token offerings as securities offerings in the United States or launched their token offerings in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Even prior to the SEC’s digital token guidance last week, many responsible attorneys were advising issuers that one conservative approach with respect to token offerings was to try to avail themselves of an exemption to registration in the United States, such as under Regulation D (by marketing, offering and selling tokens only to “accredited investors”) or Regulation S (by marketing, offering and selling tokens only to those who are not “U.S. persons”). While not necessarily legally dispositive, some issuers took the steps of requiring token purchasers to complete investor questionnaires and provide to the issuer certain representations and covenants at the time of such token purchase, and some issuers tried to block U.S. IP addresses from being able to access token offerings in an effort to deter U.S. persons from participating. And even if in the short term token offerings move offshore, that may only be a temporary phenomenon. Consider that certain potential non-U.S. jurisdictions may themselves have no, or very little, definitive guidance regarding the classification of digital tokens or the treatment and requirements of digital token offerings, leaving offerings in those locations subject to similar risk as the United States. While other jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, may have provided some guidance, that guidance may be based upon a particular type of token (such as Ether), and there may be uncertainty as to whether such guidance will continue to be applicable to tokens with characteristics that differ from that particular “test case” token. Query whether staff at the SEC may have connected with their counterparts in foreign jurisdictions in which token offerings are taking place and discussed these issues and whether those other jurisdictions are looking at what the SEC is doing and considering taking steps to follow suit. Indeed, just this Tuesday, August 1, 2017, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which had previously been seen by many as a jurisdiction par excellence for token offerings, issued a press release clarifying that certain tokens with equity- or debt-like features may be subject to the requirements of Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act. It comes down to this – if an instrument is not a security simply because one has taken it out of paper form and moved it into an electronic ledger, then theoretically, what would stop any issuer from taking any traditional security and tokenizing it so as to avoid the securities laws of various international jurisdictions? This is of course an absurd result, and as foreign jurisdictions begin to better understand what blockchain tokens are (i.e., a new technology, a new form for representing a set of rights, but not a universally new set of rights itself), we expect that they will begin issuing guidance that is relatively in line with the SEC’s report. Josh Klayman: Consider also that conducting an offering “offshore” (meaning completely outside of the United States) is harder than it looks. It is critical to remember that the token offering on which the SEC focused its enforcement action last week was an-“offshore” offering. The DAO token offering was launched from Switzerland by a Swiss foundation, but it, nonetheless, was subject to U.S. securities laws and likely violated the rules and regulations of many, many jurisdictions. Even if a token is initially issued in a proper offshore offering, there may be a “flowback” issue, if tokens initially issued to non-U.S. persons, nonetheless, end up being held by “U.S. persons” due to secondary transfers. Among other things, this may trigger ongoing reporting requirements by the issuer under U.S. law. So as long as the U.S. is a market that issuers want to reach, U.S. laws will be relevant. Going offshore can also be fairly difficult as a practical matter. Beyond just choosing a launch jurisdiction – some of the more popular jurisdictions have included Singapore and Switzerland, but many others, including Gibraltar, Luxembourg, Cayman Islands, Malta and others are being used or contemplated – and finding experienced local counsel and other advisors in those jurisdictions to help structure the token offering and prepare relevant documentation, there are many other considerations: Tax guidance with respect to digital tokens may be uncertain or unclear, and if there is a nexus to the United States or proceeds of the token offering need to be brought into the U.S., there sometimes may be little or no tax benefit to launching the offering outside of the United States. In certain jurisdictions, there may be a token offering organizational structure that is used that differs from what we may see in the United States, such as, in Switzerland, the foundation model, or, in Singapore, use of a plc as issuer. These structures may require the use of complicated intercompany agreements or arrangements, and the organization types involved may have particular governance and other requirements that may be unexpected, undesirable or onerous – for example, a requirement that a director of the issuer must be a citizen of a particular jurisdiction. While some non-U.S. jurisdictions use English as an official language others do not. Unless one is fluent in the local language, it may be challenging for an English-speaker to operate in a foreign jurisdiction. In addition, it is important to bear in mind that, while some countries, like the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore, operate under a common law regime, not all nations do – some have civil law systems and, notably, Switzerland has a triple layer of law, including cantonal law. Finally, issuers, investors and others need to be aware that securities laws are not the only laws that apply in the token offering context and that they will need to understand and comply with a full range of applicable laws. This is true not only in the United States, where, among other things, many financial services regulatory (including, for example, money transmitter laws) and other laws need to be considered, but also in other jurisdictions. For example, in its August 1 press release on token offerings, the Monetary Authority of Singapore confirmed that money laundering and terrorist financing risks apply to certain tokens, in addition, potentially, to Singaporean securities laws. Josh Klayman: The recent SEC guidance may, in some ways, actually expand the pool of potential token offering investors and increase the aggregate amount of capital that is invested in token offerings. By providing some structure and acknowledging token offerings as a new capital-raising method, some – including venture, private equity and hedge funds, established large financial institutions and Fortune 500 companies, and accredited investors generally – may view the SEC’s statements as validating token offerings as a viable financing method and making it a safer space in which to invest. Greater legal certainty also may attract reputable issuers wishing to attract capital from such sophisticated – and, often, well capitalized – token purchasers, while deterring token launches by those potential issuers that do not wish to comply with important investor-protection laws and wanted to market, offer and sell tokens to the general public (including potential purchasers who may be unsophisticated and inexperienced investors). Bitcoinist: What advice do you have for token issuers — who have completed an ICO or are looking to launch one soon — to avoid breaking the law? Josh Klayman: Hire counsel! If there is any doubt that your token is likely to be classified as a security, a more conservative approach would be to market and sell them as securities. Remember that regardless of how the U.S. securities laws apply, there are also other bodies of law – money transfer laws, tax laws, consumer protection laws, corporate governance laws, etc. – that may apply and should be carefully considered as well. And stay tuned! There is a lot that the SEC has not yet addressed, including whether The DAO should have registered as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “’40 Act”), an area in which our investment management colleagues are focused. Bitcoinist: What advice do you have for US citizens — who have participated in ICO’s or are looking to participate — to avoid breaking the law? Dan Kahan: Thankfully for token investors, the SEC’s regulations are in place largely to protect you. In fact, one of the SEC’s main concerns for potential investors is that they be wary of buying into fraudulent schemes. To that end, last week, the SEC released an entire bulletin to help protect investors from the risks associated with token offerings. At the same time, those who have purchased tokens and believe that such tokens may be securities should be mindful of various limitations and obligations that apply to transactions in securities, including antifraud rules and restrictions on resales. Bitcoinist: Is this is the first step in a critical maturation process? What kind of follow up do you expect from the SEC and when? Dan Kahan: Yes, we think so. The SEC made clear that new technologies like token offerings and distributed ledgers are not free from compliance with existing laws and regulations. In order for token offerings to become and remain a viable capital raising method that attracts sophisticated investors, responsible issuers and other reputable market participants, this message needed to be sent. Now, the maturation and development of the token market – including the education and protection of token purchasers – is underway. Alfredo Silva: With The DAO token, the SEC gave us a perfect example of when a token is a security. A next step may be to tell us when, in its judgment, a token should not be considered a security. While the SEC may be unlikely to come out and say directly that a given token is not a security, it can indirectly – but clearly – indicate its stance on a particular matter, including by issuing a “no action” letter. What we mean when we refer to a “no action letter” is something like this: if a potential token issuer petitions the SEC, proposing to issue a token that will not fall within the definition of a security under the Securities Act, and describing to the SEC in detail the characteristics of that token (including the proposed rights of the applicable token holders) and the offering process therefor, the SEC may, in its discretion, respond in a public writing that, based on the facts and circumstances described in the issuer’s petition, the SEC would recommend that the SEC enforcement division take “no action” against the issuer for failure to register the token offering (or avail itself of an exemption from registration) or to otherwise treat the token as a security. It is important to remember, however, that the SEC’s issuance of a “no action” letter cannot necessarily be relied on as precedent for a different token or offering, particularly one that does not share the same characteristics as the token or offering described in the petition to which the “no action” letter responds. Josh Klayman: Additionally, the SEC has not yet addressed numerous other relevant questions, including whether The DAO was an investment company. As such, we expect that we may hear more from the SEC in the near term, especially if additional enforcement actions are brought by the SEC or retail investors suffer significant widespread harm.

bitcoinist	lets-build-the-first-participative-regulated-tokenized-and-cryptocurrency-compatible-bank	Let's Build the First Participative, Regulated, Tokenized and Cryptocurrency Compatible Bank - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T13:15	Hush’s ambition is to create the first regulated, participative and tokenized model for simplified services so that users cans use their money in FIAT and/or crypto-currencies. Hush is a neobank that has been conceived of and created by Éric Charpentier, ex-founder of Morning which is also a neobank. In order to rethink and reinvent the mutualism banking model combined with a mobile and decentralized environment, he is now working with a small which its members have skills in the banking regulation area and in crypto-currencies. Hush CEO Éric Charpentier states: The increased usage of crypto-currencies, especially the Initial Coin Offerings (raising money through tokens), opens new perspectives in order to transform the traditional banking model, supported by users’ community which will allow to innovate as well as ensure a long- lasting economical independence. Our aim is to federate an active community of users with a double objective: Offering to well informed users concerning the crypto environment, a regulated model in order to develop a daily utilization of crypto-currencies/euro; Opening new perspectives to the inexperienced users about the crypto-currencies sector as well as enjoying an innovating mobile bank service using FIAT. In addition, today, many banks block transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges, preventing cryptocurrency users from freely using their cryptocurrency money. That’s why Hush wants to be a native NeoBank to understand and meet the expectations of cryptocurrency users. Indeed, Hush’s approach will be practical, rational and educational. after applying for the Payment Institution authorization, Hush will propose several functionalities in accordance with users expectations with our Premium model, and particularly: Opening accounts by invitation or sponsoring programs with the users’ initiative; A premium payment card including a reinforced security and an innovating usage ; A crypto wallet in order to safely manage user’s investments; An instantaneous conversion service of crypto-currencies with the possibility for the users to spend their money whenever they want to; Proposition of proactive insurances; An account project for users so that they can finance and realize their project and fix objectives for For Hush, the ICO’s strategy is to guaranty for its users a stable fund management and to provide a financial independence. Hush has the ambition to organize a collective and decentralized governance model for users and to federate a community with strong convictions and be opened to the crypto-currencies. The token USH, created as an instrument of values, is the key point of these objectives. Our unique economic model with this token USH enrolls these long-term objectives. These USH tokens will provide several services to the holders: a participative and contributive voice in this project a payment method proposed by Hush, in which paying a Hush service with USH Token brings a 50% reduction on commissions. a reward tool thanks to a loyalty and engagement program: Hush Ambassador a reward of the contributive activity and the use of Hush services in order to redistribute USH Tokens to the most active users in Hush’s Ambassador program. To define this token, Hush has been assisted by well-known experts from Deloitte France and bitconseil.fr. The tokens sale will start next 22nd January 2018 at the occasion of the launching of the pre-ICO. The eligible payments could be realized in Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and by payment card in order to allow an important number of participants to build a neobank community. Despite our issuance of 60,000,00.00 USH tokens, its objective is reasonable with a hardcap of 10M€. This amount will provide the resources needed to develop our activities and offer better perspectives for the investors. With this ICO, Hush should bring the two sectors closer with a regulated banking offer which will include the crypto-currencies in order to imagine the future decentralized banking model.

bitcoinist	london-startup-uk-bitcoin-atm	How One London Startup Plans to Conquer the Bitcoin ATM Industry - Bitcoinist.com	2017-04-22T10:30	Bitcoinist spoke with Landry Ntahe, head of operations at BCB ATM, a London-based Bitcoin ATM startup that currently holds the number two position by market share in the UK. UK Bitcoin ATM Scene Today, BCB ATM has 16% of the Bitcoin ATM market share in the UK with seven locations in London where their Lamassu machines can be found. With an aggressive strategy of expansion to other UK cities and beyond, it’s planning to take over this nascent industry by undercutting their competition, offering customers much lower fees when buying bitcoin. While the number of Bitcoin ATMs has already broken the 1,000 mark, the scene in London is thriving in particular, with new machines being added every month. Besides simply buying bitcoin, BCB ATM is aiming to provide additional services through their machines such as sending money abroad, topping up mobile accounts and more, which should help bring Bitcoin closer to mainstream adoption. Bitcoinist: What has been your biggest challenge in running a BTM business? Landry Ntahe (LN): Lack of awareness of Bitcoin in the elder generation, which makes them reluctant to place a BTM in their establishment. More needs to be done to educate others about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. That’s why we’re here to bring online currency to the high street. Bitcoinist: What competitive advantage are you relying on to become the number one BTM company? LN: We are always working hard to find new ways of bringing our services to the masses. Our next plan is altcoin adoption across our ATM network. Bitcoinist: How big is your team? LN: We have a core team of 5 from different working backgrounds including a young apprentice as well as agents throughout the UK. Bitcoinist: Have you considered producing your own machines? LN: We leave the hardware to the manufacturers, our main focus and interest is on the software and developing relationships with the manufacturers to suggest features that we feel would be should be implemented in the future to improve the services offered. Bitcoinist: What features do you feel should be added besides buying bitcoin? LN: We’d like to merge everyday payment services such as topping up your mobile phone with our BTM’s. We would like to see everyday household bills paid with our machines. That is gas, electricity, Internet, phone etc. Bitcoinist: How are you able to offer your customer 4% fees compared to your competitors’ 8%? LN: With strategic planning to reduce overall overheads and costs as well as a risk strategy to manage volatility and also working very closely with an upcoming Lithuanian based exchange who we met at the recently held Bitcoin & Blockchain conference in Moscow. Bitcoinist: Does that mean you’re looking at Russia to grow your BTM network? LN: We have been approached by a few countries to expand our network but we have made a promising friendship with a development team along with a manufacturing company in Russia. Bitcoinist: Are you currently only focusing on London however? LN: We’re currently open to any city in the UK. We have an installation due in Birmingham coming soon. We’re also in talks with CoinFestUK to get a BTM installed and assisting a venture to increase awareness in Manchester. Bitcoinist: What’s your market share threshold that you’d like to reach before expanding into other cities? LN: Our plan is that we want to expand to every major UK city within the next 18 months. Bitcoinist: Are your machines one-way or two-way as well? LN: We currently have one-way machines but our new two-way machines are due to be installed at one of our Central London locations next week. Bitcoinist: From a business standpoint, is one type more profitable to operate than the other; or does it depend on location? LN: From online studies and articles, there is a higher demand for one-way BTMs. However, we would like to stay ahead of the game and have taken a business decision to install 2-way machines moving forward. We couldn’t say as of yet if it would be more profitable but in our opinion location is the key factor in determining sales and profit. Bitcoinist: What do you look for in a location or merchant when placing a machine? LN: Presentation of the establishment, open attitude towards cryptocurrency or willingness to learn about. Bitcoinist: What does one need besides cash to buy bitcoin from your BTM? Is there a buy limit? LN: Our current policy doesn’t require any identification such as passport or driving license at the point of sale. But we are currently working with developers to find a way of implementing this without the need of a physical ID to comply with KYC procedures. The buy limit currently is £600 per transaction. Bitcoinist: Who is the typical BTM customer? LN: We wouldn’t know, that’s the beauty of Bitcoin, anonymity! Bitcoinist: Where do you acquire your bitcoin? LN: We use an array of suppliers from exchanges and miners. Bitcoinist: What would you tell someone who wants to start their own BTM business? LN: Don’t do it, haha. Bitcoinist: Can you share where we could see a BCB machine next? LN: We have 8 installations due in the next 6 weeks, keep an eye out on social media for updates. Facebook facebook.com/bcbatm Twitter @bcb_atm Add us on Snapchat as we regularly snap videos and pics of installations and updates @bcbatm Bitcoinist: Thanks for the insight into your business. Best of luck with your expansion plans! Images courtesy of BCB-ATM.com, Shutterstock, CoinATMradar.com
bitcoinist	macro-trader-mike-novogratz-says-wall-street-nearing-bitcoin-adoption	Macro Trader Mike Novogratz Says Wall Street Nearing Bitcoin Adoption	2017-11-14T05:00	Former hedge fund manager turned cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz just said he believes institutional investors are only weeks away from adopting Bitcoin and Ethereum en masse. Novogratz also said this Wall Street “migration” will cause crypto prices to surge. Fortress Investment Group alumni Mike Novogratz once again offered his bullish opinions on the crypto space in new comments from the first day of New York’s Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit. “The institutionalization of this space is coming,” Novogratz said. “It’s coming pretty quick.” Novogratz pointed to developments like CME Group’s launch of Bitcoin futures in Q4 2017 and CBOE president Chris Concannon’s recent projection of bringing Bitcoin ETFs “to market” as signs that Wall Street and institutional powerhouses the world over are about to start investing in the top cryptocurrencies – both indirectly and directly – like never before. Novogratz noted that investing in these crypto futures and ETFs will become exceedingly easy for institutional investors, which likely means a tsunami of institutional funds will soon begin pouring into the space. Consider, for example, that the CME is the largest regulated foreign currency exchange in the world – their BTC futures will give thousands of institutional clients the ability to join the Bitcoin boom. Per Novogratz: “When it’s that easy [for institutions to invest], the price of bitcoin or ethereum is going to go much higher. And that is a lot closer than people think.” Big money is coming to bitcoin: ex-Fortress executive Novogratz https://t.co/ZDcuA6mv9z pic.twitter.com/R1T92W7LvA — Reuters Top News (@Reuters) November 14, 2017 Novogratz’s estimate is that it will take six months for critical mass to be reached insofar as institutional adoption goes. The macro hedge fund maestro also noted how these cryptocurrency futures and ETFs will be inherently attractive to more conservative-minded investment firms, in that they’ll provide a safer, less volatile outlet for capitalizing on the ever-surging crypto community. Wall Street to Pave the Way to Novogratz’s $10k BTC Projection? Back in October, Novogratz – who famously picked up 500,000 ether back when they were still $1.00 each – appeared on CNBC’s Fast Money program and estimated the price of bitcoin would hit $10,000 by August 2018. That would be an astounding, unprecedented price point for the current #1 cryptocurrency, but after Bitcoin toppled multiple all-time price highs in October 2017 alone, hitting $10k per coin within the next few months is clearly reasonable. And what makes this $10k price point seem more like an eventuality than a possibility are developments like the CME’s coming Bitcoin futures and the recent Wall Street Journal report that Goldman Sachs is considering launching a Bitcoin trading operation of its own. As Novogratz aptly put it in his Fast Money interview: “I can hear the herd coming.” Just how high could #bitcoin go? Hedge fund legend @novogratz says $BTC will soar to over $10K in the next 6 to 10 months pic.twitter.com/b3ZKS1hXau — CNBC's Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) October 10, 2017 And the herd is Wall Street. And they’ve got trillions of dollars they can migrate into the crypto space in the years ahead. For his part, Novogratz is personally banking on the space continuing to explode, too, as the founder of Galaxy Investment Partners – an operation explicitly dedicated to cryptocurrency projects. And soon enough, his firm will be able to buy Bitcoin futures and ETFs just like everyone else. Do you think Novogratz is spot on? Are these institutional investors going to power cryptocurrencies to new heights? Be sure to sound off in the comments below! Images courtesy of Rick Wilking / Reuters
bitcoinist	maidsafecoin-decentralized-internet	MaidSafeCoin: Decentralized Internet - Bitcoinist.com	2014-05-08T18:00	As Bitcoin had an ambitious dream to decentralize currency, MaidSafeCoin has an ambitious dream to decentralize the internet. The coin is only half the story, it is to be used in tandem with the SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) network. Why should we decentralize Internet, it seems to be working fine right? Well for now, at least. According to MaidSafe’s whitepaper, datacenters that support the Internet’s backbone are having increasingly trouble to cope with the 2.4 billion people connected to it, a number that is expected to increase to 3.6 billion by 2017. On top of that it’s highly expensive, as datacenters consume 1.3% of the world’s electricity on top of the specialized server equipment required. With this highly centralized situation that is bound to fail, decentralization, which MaidSafeCoin is trying to do, should occur sooner than later. It plans on doing this by taking “all the Internet services currently available today and decentralizes them removing centers and other central points of weakness.” Besides increasing reliability and stability of the internet if this were to happen, we would gain several other advantages such as privacy, anonymity, easier file sharing, and network resistance to MITM attacks just to name a few. How does it plan on accomplishing this goal? With their version of mining, which goes under the name of Proof of Resource. “Farmers” or miners in other cryptocurrencies, rely on mathematical proofs. With MaidSafeCoin, coins are earned by donating resources (CPU processing cycles, bandwidth, etc.) to the network, basically a p2p server system. They donate these resources through a “vault”, similar to a Masternode in Darkcoins network, in that it is a node running on the network. Farmers are expected to receive 800 coins daily on average, according to MaidSafe’s website. With current prices however, being around 1.4 cents, that’s around $11.20. So even at fairly low prices, the reward is competitive with that amongst mining. What MaidSafe is trying to do is revolutionary. Perhaps even more revolutionary than the idea of a decentralized currency. It’s going to go over its fair amount of hurdles as well, such as cooperation from corporations, getting enough users to become farmers to make this feasible, and possible laws that might interfere. However, if enough people come on board. I believe in the end everyone will benefit. This just shows that the concept of decentralization, the removing of a central figure, can be applied to all sorts of aspects of life.

bitcoinist	make-money-cryptocurrencies-irrespective-volatility	How to Make Money in Cryptocurrencies Irrespective of the Volatility - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T12:30	Mark Twain said, “During the gold rush it’s a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.” Why? Because pick and shovel businesses make money even when the people who use them don’t find gold. This is a perfect metaphor for how to make money in crypto irrespective of the volatility. In this case, the pick and shovel businesses are the exchanges, wallet providers, and all the other crypto service providers. Unfortunately, most of these companies are private and therefore not open for investment. But, there are some exceptions… FinLab – German Listed Investment Company Over the past five years, FinLab-shares (Bloomberg A7A:GR) have increased tenfold because FinLab focuses on investments in these pick and shovel-esque crypto service providers. For example, FinLab has a 25% stake in the Bitcoin/gold trading platform Vaultoro, a company whose business has grown dramatically over the last six months on the back of the crypto boom. Furthermore, FinLab recently announced their stake in Iconiq Lab, the world’s first batch-controlled initial coin offering ( ICO ) and token sale accelerator program. According to industry rumors, they are also working on a cryptocurrency investment bank. FinLab is part of Christian Angermayer’s empire. The German serial investor and entrepreneur is tipped as Germany’s No. 1 powerbroker in the financial services and technology space. Angermayer was responsible for recruiting Peter Thiel as a co-investor in two of FinLab’s portfolio companies – the deposit platform Deposit Solutions, which quickly became one of Europe’s most valuable fintech startups, and nextmarkets, a social trading platform. He also orchestrated the Chinese HNA Group’s 9.9% stake in Germany’s largest lender, Deutsche Bank. It is clear that Angermayer, whose investment holding Apeiron Investment Group is headquartered in Malta, has a fantastic global network, which consistently delivers exceptional returns.

bitcoinist	malaysian-taxman-gives-luno-cold-shoulder	Malaysian Taxman Gives Luno the Cold Shoulder - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-16T23:30	Tax authorities in Malaysia have indefinitely frozen Luno’s local account used in the country, BitX Malaysia, while they investigate possible tax concerns. London-based cryptocurrency exchange, Luno, has had its Malaysian account frozen pending an investigation by the country’s tax authority, the Inland Revenue Board (IRB). In a statement sent to The Edge Markets, the exchange said: As part of this, IRB has requested that we provide them with information on all our Malaysian customers: identification, deposits/withdrawals, and transactions. We are working closely with the IRB to limit the parameters of this broad request. As set out in our privacy policy, we value your (Luno customers’) privacy and strive to protect your personal information. We will only provide personal information where we are legally required to do so and are working with our local advisers to ensure that any disclosure is consistent with our obligations to you, our customers. The Taxman Cometh Luno called on its Malaysian clients to respect and follow the country’s financial requirements: Bitcoin and digital currencies are a new area of development for everyone including regulators, financial institutions, tax authorities, and many others. Navigating this requires everyone to work together to figure out optimal solutions to ensure the industry is safe and conducive to business. We are supportive of the recent measures by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) to come up with reporting requirements for digital currency exchanges. In a similar manner, we are working closely with our banks and the IRB to come to a swift conclusion with regard to this investigation. Funds are Safe and Secure Even though the exchange does not know when the account, locally trading as BitX Malaysia, will be up and running again, they did offer reassurances to their clients: “Unfortunately, we can’t give a time estimate for this to be resolved, but we’ll notify you (Luno customers) as soon as we have another update. In the meanwhile, you (Luno customers) can still buy, sell, send and receive digital currencies like ETH (Ethereum) and BTC (Bitcoin) with your MYR local currency balance. All your funds, local and digital currencies, remain safe with Luno and all other services remain unaffected.” #Malaysia Remains Open To #Crypto Trading https://t.co/bzfBKdGdKj pic.twitter.com/pgdwXvvS6N — Bitcoinist.com (@bitcoinist) January 3, 2018 No Crypto Ban in Malaysia Last November, Malaysia vocalized its plan to introduce a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the country. Even though Malaysian authorities have said that they will not ban cryptocurrencies, exchanges operating in the country will have to adhere to certain criteria, which may or may not be related to Luno’s current predicament. Do you think Malaysia will ramp up regulation efforts in the not-too-distant future? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock
bitcoinist	malicious-wallet-generation-software-could-produce-known-private-keys	Malicious Bitcoin Wallet Generation Software Could Produce Known Private Keys - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-30T22:00	An anonymous user on Pastebin has provided evidence that some wallet software may be generating private keys that can be easily discoverable, and therefore easy to take any bitcoins associated with that address. There has been no word on what wallet software is possibly affected, nor if this is a malicious act or a simple coding error. TL;DR – Scroll to the last subsection What is a Private Key? I’m going to give a little bit of background and explain some terminology for those who don’t know how bitcoin works under the hood. The first thing is a private key. If you think of your bitcoin wallet address as a lock, the private key is the key used to unlock it and spend the funds inside. When you generate a wallet on your device, whether it be on a computer or phone or whatever, what it actually does is generate a random set of numbers of letters and numbers (also known as a ‘string’) that is your private key. Your private key is the only thing that gives you legitimate ownership of your coins. Control of your private key is what allows you to spend the coins that are in your wallet. An example private key looks like this 6c951c460a4cfe5483863adacafad59e5de7e55876a21857733ca94049d7d10c Once your private key is generated, it is run through a hash function. A hash function is a mathematical function that, when you put a number or string it in, will return another string that has no relation back to the first number/string. It is very easy to find the second number from the first, but mathematically impossible to find the first from the second. The reason for this is that the sheer number of possible private keys is so large, it dwarfs the number of seconds since the dawn of the universe by several orders of magnitude. This second number is known as your public key, and this is hashed again to give you your Bitcoin wallet addresses. You can click here for more information about how private keys, public keys, and wallets work. “Discovering” a Private Key On to what is actually going on. Since a private key can be literally anything, you could technically take any phrase or string of numbers and letters and use it as your key. You could just throw anything into the hash function and generate the wallet. The public key would be derived from that, and you’d be on your way. This is generally not recommended since it goes to follow that if you can think of your private key so can someone else. It wouldn’t be truly random, which what is needed to create a secure wallet. BrainWallet.io has a nifty tool that allows users to input whatever they’d like and then derive a private key/public key pair from that. Since the blockchain is an open public ledger, you can go look at some addresses that have been derived from common phrases. Someone used “satoshi nakamoto” to create a wallet, and the addresses associated have had small amounts of bitcoins sent to it, but they were cleared out immediately after. Other phrases like “ I find your lack of faith disturbing ” and “ these aren’t the droids you’re looking for ” also have been tagged with a small transaction. There’s no reason to use these as your keys because they’re insecure, but people have sent coins just to leave a mark on the blockchain. Anonymous Pastebin Guy noted: If you peer into the blockchain, you will find that people have ‘played’ with the chain by sending small amounts of bitcoins to addresses corresponding to private keys generated using Sha256… It’s quite obvious these were _meant_ to be found. It turns out there are a lot of these addresses. (Keep looking and you will easily find some.) This is nothing new and has been known to the bitcoin community for a while. The user that posted these findings, who has chosen to remain anonymous, goes much further down the rabbit hole. He began thinking of other ways to “discover” common private keys and downloaded a complete index of all bitcoin addresses that were publicly available on the blockchain and started trying different things to discover keys that possibly had a few bits associated with them. It was kind of a pet project. Testing Private Keys to Find Bitcoins The Pastebin user started using pieces of data that are publicly available on the blockchain to see if any of them had been used to create wallets. He used block hashes for every block since the Genesis Block, Merkle roots from every block, common words and phrases that had been hashed multiple times, and finally started testing all bitcoin addresses. Most analysis of all bitcoin addresses will only involve addresses that have unspent balances, but he also decided to include addresses that had a balance of zero. His first experiment involved checking every block hash to see if any of them had been used as a private key. This is kind of a smart way of remembering your private key, because you’d only need to know the block number to be able to go recover your key. Sure enough, over forty addresses existed that at one point over the past seven years been sent bitcoins. All of them had long been swept, but the user decided to keep investigating. He then used the Merkle roots of some blocks to check for discoverable keys, and once again found addresses that had coins sent to them. Unfortunately, the balances were all zero, but the hunt was heating up. The third experiment was tested using common words that were hashed multiple times, such as “ hello ” or “ sender ”. The hashes of these words are then hashed again and again, giving another layer of added security and much less of a chance that the key will be discovered. If you can hash a word once, you can do it a million times. “ hello” was hashed, and that hash hashed, over and over and eventually, it produced a private key that had been used. Several addresses were found using the method that all had transactions sent to them at one point or another. One of the funniest, in my opinion, is the word “ password” which after hashing its 1,975 times you get a valid private key that has had funds sent to it. It’s very likely that the creator of this address was born that year. The last experiment is where the user started asking some questions. He took his index of all bitcoin addresses and tested every public address to see if it had been used as a private key. And again, he searched a fraction of the blockchain and found dozens of addresses. The difference with many of these was that they had received and emptied the bitcoins associated with them within the last weeks or days. The idea of using a public address as a public key doesn’t really make sense and is very risky because it is discoverable. These addresses were receiving bitcoin and taking it within minutes or hours of it being confirmed. At this point, Anonymous Pastebin Guy started to smell something fishy. So, What’s Going on Here? Pastebin Guy’s claim is that some third-party wallet custodial service, such as a mining pool, gambling site, or just a straight-up web wallet, may have malicious code in their backend that will generate private keys based on public addresses, allowing someone to easily steal the coins associated with the address as the private key is public knowledge on the blockchain. He goes on to say that this code has been at work for years, with bitcoins being siphoned out the whole time. He also makes it clear, however, that there is a chance that this is a simply a bug in the system that is creating non-random private keys. The user created a bot to constantly scan these addresses and snag any bitcoin that was sent to them, and through dumb luck, he caught a transaction of 9.5 bitcoins to an address with a discover-able private key. Unfortunately, the bot was not working as expected and didn’t generate a transaction in time. The bitcoins were swept from the wallet, off to their next destination. He started getting very suspicious, however, and continued running the bot and noticed the same “collection address” being used for many of these key discovery methods. At least one address from all the methods was funneling bitcoin, bit by bit, to whoever was controlling this system. He was watching 6+ transactions come through his database of private keys per day. /u/fitwear’s missing 9 BTC A Reddit user by the name of /u/fitwear posted about his blockchain.info wallet getting hacked and getting just about nine bitcoins stolen. You can see the original Reddit post here. Blockchain.info support’s response was the typical “your account must have gotten compromised” canned reply, but in reality /u/fitwear had done everything right. A good password, proper two-factor authentication – none of it mattered and the coins were still gone. The anonymous user from the Pastebin article managed to find the 9 bitcoins on an address to which he had a copy of the private key in his database. /u/fitwear was lucky and the user returned the coins to him/her, but further investigation of the address proved to be concerning. According to /u/fitwear: I entered the security key in Blockchain.info on my fully security enabled 2fa account & manually entered all of the information to avoid copy and pastes e.t.c……The 9 BTC left my account & hit my new block chain wallet. After 4 seconds it then bounced to a random address that I have no connection with a high transaction fee to push it through quickly. I’ve tried emailing support and they insist that someone must have my account information or I have some malware that has injected my copy & paste. A compromised key managed to get imported into /u/fitwear’s blockchain.info wallet. Some non-blockchain.info-damning scenarios include someone compromised his account in the past and is just now claiming funds, or that there was some browser malware that affected the blockchain.info wallet. The thing that really doesn’t make sense is that if it was malware, it is logical that the developer would create a private key off of some private piece of info, not just some random address. The fact that it is a random address gives anyone who has caught on to this scheme a chance to take the coins before the hacker can send them to a wallet under his control. It just doesn’t add up. The code that would be needed to generate discovered private keys is surprisingly simple – it’s just a couple of hash functions. If it was some third-party wallet provider, this bit of malware would be hidden among the thousands and thousands of lines of code that make up a back end. Also, this function wouldn’t draw too much attention during a code audit because it is just hashing a public address. Hence the hiding in plain sight analogy. If the malware was coded in a way that a private key was created that only the hacker and the hackee knows, that would be much more suspicious than coding a key generation system that produced an easily discover-able private key. So, What Now? Are Cryptocurrencies Screwed? While this data is very concerning, Bitcoin’s underlying security is not affected. 99.999% of private keys that are generated are generated randomly, and if a key is generated with a proper level of entropy, or randomness, it is statistically impossible for someone to discover your keys. Back to the number of seconds since the birth of the universe example, trying to discover a randomly generated key would be like trying to guess one specific second out of all the seconds from then until now. It is ridiculously unlikely that you would even guess the same year, let alone the same month, day, hour, minute, or second. If you are using a private wallet where you control the private keys, you are 100% not affected. The people who should be concerned about this are those with coins held by custodial third parties, such as exchanges or web wallets. However, I want to make it very clear that there is ZERO direct evidence proving blockchain.info or anyone else had direct involvement in /u/fitwear’s theft or any other weird transaction that the user found on the blockchain. Basically, rest easy. If you control your own private keys and they were generated randomly, you have no chance of being affected by this possible attack vector. If you want to read more about this user’s findings, you can read the whole Pastebin article here. What do you think about this possible exploit? Are you securing your coins accordingly?

bitcoinist	masked-gunmen-steal-fortune-bitcoin-daylight-uk-robbery	Masked Gunmen Steal 'Fortune' in Bitcoin in UK Robbery - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-28T09:00	The very first UK Bitcoin robbery occurred when four armed men broke into a home and forced a crypto trader to transfer a “fortune” in Bitcoin. The meteoric rise of Bitcoin over the course of 2017 featured a number of positive effects. A lot of people made a good deal of money, and media and public interest in cryptocurrency reached new heights. However, a downside to such attention is that criminals now see physically stealing Bitcoin or money used to buy crypto as a viable way to make money. A family in the UK found this out the hard way when four armed men broke into their home and forced the husband to transfer his bitcoins. Terrifying Ordeal It’s being called the first Bitcoin robbery in the UK, and it took place in Moulsford, Oxfordshire, a wealthy enclave, during the morning hours. The criminals broke into the home belonging to a cryptocurrency trader and his family. The criminals were armed with handguns and wearing balaclavas. They tied up the trader’s wife and put the couple’s baby outside in a pram before forcing the trader to transfer over a “fortune” in bitcoins. (The exact amount that was stolen has not been disclosed.) The criminals then fled, and the police manhunt began immediately after. A police helicopter was used in an effort to locate the hoodlums, but to no avail. Nearby schools were put on lockdown. Police are asking for any camera footage that shows four suspicious males in the area during the early morning hours. One woman apparently saw the criminals. She describes : I saw four young men in black tracksuits with the hoods pulled up, crossing the road to the property where it took place. They were aged 18 to 25, dark-skinned and super-fit. They jumped over the fence on the other side of the road. I didn’t see any gun, but that’s what people locally are saying – and that the men wore balaclavas which I didn’t see either, just the hoodies pulled up. Media Hyperventilates on Bitcoin Fortunately, no one in the family was injured during the Bitcoin robbery. Since the media has no blood and gore to wheeze on about, they’re drudging back up the same old tired talking points that Bitcoin is used mainly for illicit means. Naturally, this is ludicrous as the blockchain is pure transparency. The UK-based cybersecurity firm Elliptic recently released a report that shows less than 1% of all Bitcoin transactions originate for criminal reasons. Of course, hard facts do little to hinder media speculation on Bitcoin and illegal activities. While the rise of cryptocurrencies is tremendous, there is a dark side. There’s been a number of recent criminal attacks upon individuals with a connection to crypto. There has been a kidnapping and multiple accounts of robberies over the last month or so. Sadly, such instances are likely to continue as long as cryptocurrencies continue to gain in value. Are you worried about the seeming rise of Bitcoin robberies? What can be done to stop them? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pxhere and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	meteoric-rise-cryptocurrencies-triggering-cyber-attacks	Is The Meteoric Rise In Cryptocurrencies Triggering More Cyber Attacks? - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-07T14:00	The cryptocurrency market is at an all-time high as coins recover from a brief holiday bear season into a bullish New Year. But could this unprecedented growth in value attract cybercriminals? Currently, there is a huge bullish run by Bitcoin and other alternate coins on the cryptocurrency market even with the recent correction that saw Bitcoin slightly drop in value over the holidays. However, now that the New Year has kicked off, cryptocurrencies are going up in price. But could this surge in value be open season for cybercriminals? For instance, the month of December last year saw Coinbase (a leading exchange in the US) temporarily suspended Bitcoin Cash trading on its platform amid allegations of insider trading. In addition to that, the US Securities and Exchange Commission stopped a fraudulent initial coin offering for the first time. The fraudsters had lured thousands of investors with a promise of doubling their investments within months while the ICO raised $15 million. Insider trading and fraudulent ICOs aside, the real threat to digital currencies still remains cyber theft. Simply put, hackers and cyber criminals pose a much more frightful menace to investors. After all, we are living in a sophisticated digital age and since there are widespread digital tools and avenues that a hacker can use, the average person can hardly avoid or stop an attack once it begins. Frankly, one of the biggest pain points in the world of cryptocurrency is cybercrime. In fact, a report from the US Department of Homeland Security reports that between 2009 to 2015, more than a quarter of Bitcoin exchanges were attacked. Surprisingly, however, such reports have not been enough to keep cryptocurrencies from growing in value. Cyber criminals follow the money, however, and at the moment, it’s easy to see that the cryptocurrency market is where the money is as it currently stands at a market capitalization of about 816 billion according to CoinMarketCap. With the rising price of Bitcoin, cyber heists have become even more profitable as it only takes a single attack to potentially make off with millions of dollars. How to Protect Your Cryptocurrency Holdings With the cryptocurrency prices on the rise, investors need to be more vigilant than ever when it comes to protecting their digital assets. In most countries, the U.S. included, digital currencies are not recognized as legal tender so investors have little to no recourse when their funds are stolen. So, how can an individual investor take measures to protect a digital assets account? No measure is absolutely foolproof but there are steps that you can take to minimize your risk of theft: Installing an antivirus with anti-phishing support Using a VPN to protect your internet connection Adding an extra access protection layer with 2FA Using a hardware wallet to store your cryptocurrencies Setting up firewall protection Do you believe that no one including well-funded corporations is 100 percent safe from hackers?

bitcoinist	minerals-innovation-at-its-finest	Minerals: Innovation at its Finest? - Bitcoinist.com	2014-07-08T07:42	Minerals is a coin with the X11 algorithm and a total of 30 million PoW coins. The PoW phase lasts 7 days, and afterwards, PoS begins with an interest rate of 5%. Other than this, something very important is the lack of a premine or IPO which I find to be a good thing. The big thing that catches my eye about Minerals is the lack of a premine, even more so considering how much the developers have done in order to push innovation into the coin. A quote from the announcement thread regarding the dev’s interest: “The dev team will have the interest in the coin, in its further development and marketing by cutting out the middlemen – pools. There is no reason for miners to pay fees to pool owners, who don’t contribute to coin development and are only interested in instantaneous profit from the coin and easily move on to another coin. ” An interesting thing about Minerals is the way they approached the evasion of Multipools, Asic farms, and others. They went with a method not seen by other coins in which they did not provide the source code or wallet until after the PoW stage ended. This was something I found to be quite awkward considering how a source code is the way to prove a coin’s validity. However, Minerals used third party experts to confirm that the source code was there, proving the coin’s validity. All this being said, what differentiates Minerals from other X11 algorithm coins? Is there any innovation? Well, of course there is. Targeting gamers was the approach taken by Minerals, and in my opinion, a great one too. An E-Sports Betting Service The Minerals development team set out a goal to themselves. They wanted to bring a betting service to the average gamer. They call it E-sports betting in which you can bet with, and be paid through Minerals. Bet on what game you may ask. Some commonly known games, being very popular in their genre of gaming. Starcraft 2, League of Legends, and DOTA 2. Yet, the development team wants to make the process as easy and straightfoward as possible, and for this reason, the betting service is implemented into the wallet. Other than this, an IRC chat has also been implemented into the wallet for public testing of both the betting service and IRC chat. This is just the start of the betting service though. Another interesting feature that the Minerals development team wants to add to the betting service is the ability to stream matches in order to keep track of games you have bet on. They have also posted a development roadmap in which you can see how the betting service will work more in detail. I would like to note that at its current public test, DOTA and League of Legends betting is not available. Solely Starcraft 2 at the time being. Not only will you be able to bet on games though, you will bet on starcraft 2 tournaments as well which are the official ones hosted by WCS. All this being said, a huge part of the development time has gone into the betting service, even though they have said that once the betting service has been released, they will work on anonymity. This is another big thing in my eyes as it will bring anonymous betting in online games which is something I have not seen, and that I find to be unique in many ways Minerals looks very good at first glance, and more so when research is done. However, things are not as good as they seem, and whether that happens to be the case with Minerals is something we cannot foresee. The developers seem to support their coin its totality though, and that is something I admire. I admire them even more because they did not opt for a premine. However, their ability to stick around their coin is yet to be seen. Remember Minerals is a fairly new coin, and its course can be turned quite quickly. We can never be sure whether a coin will succeed or not, yet as I always say, things that most matter are a good community, developers, and innovation. I am a judge in my own eyes, and have a personal opinion on Minerals. Whether to love or hate this coin, its up to you. Make rational decisions based on research you have gathered. Don’t be guided by anything others say. The final decision is made by you Image source: bitcointalk announcement
bitcoinist	moe-levin-tnabc-miami-2016-patrick-byrne-speaking-year	Moe Levin on TNABC Miami 2016, Patrick Byrne Speaking This Year - Bitcoinist.com	2015-12-30T09:00	Moe Levin, the organizer of The North American Bitcoin Conference, has set up an excellent lineup of speakers and presenters for the 2016 show. This year, people like Patrick Byrne, Tone Vays, Bobby Lee, Jerry Brito and others will highlight a packed conference. Also Read: Coinbase Tests Bitcoin XT, Gets Removed From Bitcoin.org The 2016 conference will take place between January 21 and 22. The North American Bitcoin Conference is one of the largest events in the Bitcoin community, drawing in many attendees who come to see renowned figures in the Bitcoin space. In the past, Bitcoin giants such as Jeffrey Tucker, Tony Gallippi and Vitalik Buterin have spoken at the Miami conference. In fact, in 2014, Buterin made history by announcing his Ethereum project at a TNABC event. Bitcoinist was able to interview Moe Levin about this year’s conference, and what we can expect from this monumental Bitcoin event. The North American Bitcoin Conference has come full circle and will be back in Miami on Jan 21-22. What are some of the things you are looking forward to at this year’s event? This is the highlight of the year for us and many people in the ecosystem. The Miami conference gives us time to reflect on the past year, and set the agenda and direction for the next year. I’m looking forward to having Patrick Byrne speaking at the conference. It will be his first time with us, and I’m looking forward to hearing his views on using the blockchain to increase transparency. A lot of what I’m looking forward to is seeing old friends and new friends reconnect and share their experiences over the last year, and work together to make a better tomorrow. What are some of the changes you have seen over the last year that have impacted Bitcoin and the conferences? There remains some difficulty achieving consensus among developers and companies about the direction bitcoin should take. There is no easy way to solve this, but the people at Scaling Bitcoin are making a great effort to get the right people in the room to discuss these tough topics. From a conference perspective, 2015 was slower than 2014, certainly. In 2014, it seemed like there was a conference every other week, and that might have had to do with the great press and high price of bitcoin. As 2015 came around, it looked a bit bleak at times, and I think that translated into people spending more time working on product rather than travelling and collaborating and exploring new and alternative ideas. I hope 2016 will include a stable rise of bitcoin, more collaboration, and lots of sun in bitcoin. Patrick Byrne and Bobby Lee Head a Diverse Lineup of Speakers Who are some of the key speakers you are excited about this year? As mentioned above, Patrick Byrne is a great speaker and pioneer in so many different industries. Bobby Lee will be speaking and offers unique and important views about the ecosystem in China and developments in the region. We’ve got a great mining panel set up with Marco Streng from Genesis Miners, who continues to innovate and expand their operations. J Maurice, from Private Internet Access is one of the smartest CTOs in the space, and I’m really looking forward to hearing his talk about security and how to protect your privacy online. That’s a speech everyone should listen to. How do you feel about the convergence of the blockchain and FinTech over the last year? I think it’s a natural convergence that is still maturing. We won’t know if this convergence is working for at least another while, so best is to remain open and collaborative and support projects that lead to fulfilling some of the original promises of bitcoin. I’m most hopeful of some remittance startups using bitcoin as the backend to really make it big in 2016. Do you have any announcements you are excited about this year? There will be at least three huge product launches in Miami that I wish I could share with you. What are some things we have not touched on yet that you would like to discuss? Bitcoinist.net and bitcoin.com remain the best places for bitcoin and crypto news online and keep up the great work! Thank you Moe for the interview. TNABC Miami is shaking up to be an interesting one this year like the last. Moe teasing big announcements at the show should bring some life to the usual staid conference fair. Bitcoinist will be bringing you interviews with some of the participants as we close in on the show as well as coverage of it as it happens. What presenters are you looking forward to at TNABC this year and what would you ask them? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of TNABC Miami

The new CryptoCelebrities game allows people to buy up contracts of famous, and some not-so-famous, celebrities. Blockchain Meets the Tabloids The premise of CryptoCelebrities is pretty straightforward. Each celebrity has a sole contract that a player can purchase with Ethereum. If another player wants to collect that celebrity, then they’ll have to pay more for the contract, allowing the previous owner to enjoy a small profit. The collecting game is based upon the Ethereum blockchain, and it can get pretty expensive. A celebrity contract that is worth up to 0.05 ETH can be purchased if another player spends double the current contract value. From 0.05 ETH to 0.5 ETH, the price to purchase a contract is 1.2 times the current value. From 0.5 ETH on up, the new contract price is 1.15 times the current contract value. Let’s use Bruce Springsteen as an example. His contract will cost 0.97944 ETH to buy. If you buy it, another person can then snap it up for 1.126356 ETH. You will then get 0.146916 ETH in return. When looking at the current value of Ethereum ($997.90), this means that you’ll have to spend the equivalent of $977.38 to buy Springsteen’s contract, but you’ll earn $146.60 when somebody else buys it away from you. Vitalik Buterin is the number one celeb for CryptoCelebrities. Celebrity Craziness As CryptoKitties has shown, people are quite willing to spend gobs of money on virtual goodies. While the mechanics of CryptoCelebrities ensure that prices will continually rise, the fact that the game uses celebrities from all walks of life could give it legs. People go crazy for celebrities. Just look at the success of the insipid Kardashians (they’re not in the game currently). Then there’s the whole nature of the earning a profit when someone else buys a contract you’re holding in order to pique interest. One does wonder if the game will get any cease and desist letters for using the likeness of celebrities. It appears that the company behind the game is based in San Francisco, USA, and not in some country with notoriously lax intellectual property laws. Celebrities can cash in on their contracts being bought. They’ll have to verity their association with the game, but then they’ll earn 3% of every sale. The celeb can either keep the money or donate it to charity. Right now, the cheapest person on CryptoCelebrities is Håkan Hellström, a Swedish musician going for 0.40154 ETH. The most expensive celebrity is Vitalik Buterin, which is no surprise as he’s the co-founder of Ethereum. He goes for a hefty 20.16182 ETH. Rounding out the top five most expensive celebrities are: Angelina Jolie (13.47069 ETH), Donald Trump (13.47069 ETH), Satoshi Nakamoto (13.47069 ETH), and Emma Watson (7.35665 ETH). To be honest, I don’t see this investment game getting massively popular due to the cost, but the public’s obsession with celebrities should not be discounted. The sky is almost the limit as the blockchain -based game will be adding new celebrities as time goes on. Even deceased celebrities can be part of the collecting action as the game already has Jack Benny and Ronnie Barker amongst the celebrity contracts. What is your opinion on CryptoCelebrities? Will you be trying to snap up the contract of your favorite celeb? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of CryptoCelebrities, Wikimedia Commons, and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	neo-shines-bears-bash-crypto-markets	NEO Shines as Bears Bash Crypto Markets - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-16T10:15	When crypto markets fall, most altcoins take a beating together, as has been the case during this morning’s Asian trading session. All in the top ten are showing red with some, such as Ripple, falling by as much as 15% in the past 24 hours. Only one altcoin is posting positive gains and that is NEO. A bigger selloff occurred last week when fearmongering media outlets misreported a total crypto ban in South Korea. What actually occurred was a ban on anonymous trading accounts to prevent illegal activities, such as money laundering. NEO The Bull According to reports and figures from analytics websites, NEO has risen by 9% in the past 24 hours and over 52% over the last week. Often called the Chinese Ethereum, NEO reached a record high of $195 a few hours ago during Asian trading. The rise has pushed it back into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, where it currently sits at eighth, pushing Stellar Lumens and Iota further down the list. NEO is traded heavily in Asia, which may not be reflected on popular statistics sites such as Coinmarketcap, which has removed South Korean markets. Binance takes the majority of the trade with over 35%, followed by Korean exchange Upbit with almost 25%. At the time of writing, its market capacitalization is $10.7 billion, with $780 million traded in the past 24 hours. US DevCon The NEO community is gearing up for its first major developers conference in the United States. According to the convention’s website, the San Francisco event will have multiple sessions and workshops to bring the NEO community together for a 2 day conference full of innovative ideas and projects. The conference will feature many top speakers from the Blockchain space and provide an opportunity to recap the progress made at similar events in Amsterdam and Shanghai. NEO’s momentum comes from its focus as a smart economy platform, similar to Ethereum but marketed and used in China and the rest of the region. There will be a number of new projects and ICOs based on NEO this year, which could see its potential rising even further. [Disclaimer: the author of this article is a holder of NEO.] Did you bank on NEO or are your altcoins in the red? Add your comments below. Images courtesy of Bitcoinist archives and Pxhere.
bitcoinist	neurogress-locomotive-constant-progress-neurocontrol	Neurogress: The Locomotive for Constant Progress in Neurocontrol - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T14:00	How can a Company transform how people bring their creative and intellectual pursuits to fruition? Here’s one answer: Neurogress develops the AI-driven, blockchain based software for neurocontrol of electronics and machinery, and, as part of its initial developments, integrates it into prostheses and robots that are controlled by human thoughts. Neurocontrol is a technologically facilitated process which allows a person to directly manipulate a device using brain waves. Until recently, the ability to control objects using the power of thought was limited to the shape of our body. As technologies progress, it is becoming possible to turn all human thoughts into actions outside of the human body with the help of neural interface and AI injected software enabling a neural control of the world. Control the World with the Power of Thoughts We at Neurogress have achieved a consistent recognition of brain signals for 8 movements of a robotic arm. The very same methods can be utilized to control many other devices – but, this is only a small beginning. We hope that very soon it will be natural to control a robotic limb using a neuro-control interface. We hope that one day, thanks to Neurogress software, the world around us can be simply controlled with the power of thoughts. Neuro-controlled devices have infinite areas of applications, including in medicine, robotics, gaming, transportation, construction, and IoT. The next big step projected by Neurogress is a neuro-controlled Smart Environment enriched with gadgets and devices controlled with the power of thought. This would allow society to take that radical step of removing the barrier between thought and action. The pseudointerfaces that mankind has created over the years to control devices and objects will rapidly become redundant in a new sort of an environment, built with a human mind and controlled by it – without the need for pseudointerfaces. Revolutionize how People Interact with Technology The creation of a neuro-controlled Smart Environment is achieved through the Neurogress Ecosystem which is aimed to deliver mutual benefits of neurocontrol developments to all parties via the Neurogress platform. The Neurogress decentralized ecosystem ensures that device manufacturers, control users, software developers and algorithm trainers are supported by the Neurogress AI-based software, with all contributing to constantly improve the quality of brain signals. The end goal for Neurogress is not just to encourage developers to bring innovative new neuro-controlled devices to the market, but also to revolutionize how people interact with technology. Through gradually eliminating reliance on cumbersome physical interfaces, Neurogress aims to transform how people bring their creative and intellectual pursuits to fruition, thus becoming a locomotive for constant progress in neurocontrol.

bitcoinist	new-malware-can-mine-cryptocurrency-pc	New malware can mine cryptocurrency on your PC - Bitcoinist.com	2017-09-07T13:45	A new kind of malicious malware has been discovered. This new malware is unique in that it is able to mine cryptocurrency on victims’ computers. The New Malware Most hackers that use malware are trying to steal sensitive data or get access to important accounts, but this newly discovered malware does something else. Famous Russian cyber security firm, Kaspersky Lab, has recently discovered a new type of malware that is able to infiltrate computers and mine digital currencies. According to a recent article by Russia Today, Kaspersky Lab believes that the malware is being spread through malicious methods like social engineering and adware. The cybersecurity company also estimates that 4,000 to 5,000 computers may be affected by this malware. The Russian firm explained: According to analysts, the hacker mining network brings its owners up to $30,000 per month, Kaspersky Lab estimates that this malware network alone has earned over $209,000 by mostly mining anonymous cryptocurrencies like Zcash and Monero. The security firm also added that this particular type of malware is hard to trace for ordinary users, since they may not know or even realize that their computers have been compromised by it. BondNet botnet A similar phenomenon happened back in May 2017 when researchers discovered a botnet called “BondNet botnet.” Apparently, the botnet consisted of over 15,000 machines that stole computing power to mine the anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. According to the Israeli cyber security firm GuardiCore, the main victims of this botnet were high-profile global companies, universities, city councils, and other public institutions. The researchers suggest that Bond007.01 is operating from China because of the copy-and-pasted code that originates from Chinese websites. Hackers are exploiting a vulnerability of MySQL in order to install a remote access Trojan (RAT) and cryptocurrency miner. The report suggests that the botnet is growing by a worrying factor of 500 machines every day. Experts are blaming this on the lack of security awareness by the users. What are your thoughts on this malware? Do you think that users should be more careful with their security? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	north-korea-boosting-bitcoin	Is North Korea Boosting Bitcoin? - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-02T05:00	Bitcoin has definitely made it to the big time in 2017 as mainstream media ran reports and televised debates on the meteoric rise of the world’s number one cryptocurrency. Speculators and observers have put forward suggestions on what has caused these price surges, and one of them has been North Korea’s estranged leader, Kim Jong-un. Although markets have corrected somewhat, Bitcoin has still seen gains of around 1600% since this time last year when it traded at just over $800. There has been a lot of speculation over the reasons for this gain, including the growing fervor among investors and anticipation of broader uses for digital currencies in the near future. Side Businesses According to reports, international sanctions on North Korea to derail its nuclear program have resulted in the regime seeking “side businesses” to gain additional funding. These could include drug trafficking, endangered species trading, money laundering, currency counterfeiting, cyber piracy, and cryptocurrency theft. To function, the system needs to gain access to cryptocurrencies, then pump up the prices to maximize its returns. Finally, it needs to dispose of its crypto and receive the hard currency the regime so desperately desires, according to TechCrunch. Opening an exchange account would not work for a country that is essentially bankrupt, so North Korea would need to use its skills pool to steal virtual currencies from around the world. It has been surmised that the regime was behind a number of recent hacks orchestrated to steal Bitcoin. Hacking the South Spearphishing campaigns targeting Bitcoin traders, a series of hacks on the Youbit South Korean exchange, and other hacks on South Korean targets may all have been orchestrated by the North Korean government. TechCrunch says that North Korea is Actively hacking the bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem in a push to gain as much cryptocurrency for the regime as possible. Once enough crypto has been acquired, the regime would need to convert it back into real currency to realize its gains. Cyber security researchers have determined that the country’s Lazarus Group has been behind a number of bank and crypto exchange hacks in recent months. So much so that the South Korean government has been forced to implement more regulation over exchanges within the country. The twist is that North Korea, through their efforts, is helping to pump up the value of Bitcoin. Almost 80% of all global Bitcoin trading by the end of November was occurring in Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. As North Korea is increasing uncertainty through its nuclear weapon programs and other acts of espionage, not to mention increasing the public’s distrust of centralized financial authorities by hacking state banking, people in the region are turning in record numbers to cryptocurrency as an alternate economic system. The result is that North Korea and Kim Jong-un gain more funds when liquidating their cryptocurrency. It is unlikely that we will find out how much crypto Kim Jong-un actually holds. What is likely is that his regime and the region in general have had a huge role in Bitcoin’s spectacular growth in recent months. Is North Korea good for Bitcoin prices?

bitcoinist	north-korea-cryptocurrency-hacking-attempts-now-feature-fake-facebook-profiles	North Korea Cryptocurrency Hacking Features Fake Facebook Profiles	2017-12-20T12:15	The latest North Korean cryptocurrency hacking attempt is using fake Facebook profiles of attractive women to get an in with crypto workers. Just when you think the North Korea cryptocurrency hacking attempts can’t get any more bizarre, a new story pops up to burst that assumption. The North Korean regime has spent the last couple of years targeting cryptocurrency in order to gain some much needed revenue, and you have to begrudgingly admire the lengths to which they’ll go. Their latest attempts to get their grubby hands on some crypto features fake Facebook profiles of beautiful women. You Have a Friend Request The latest version of the North Korea cryptocurrency hacking attempts definitely takes a page from an old classic of using a pretty face. The South Korean intelligence agency reports that hackers from the communist regime are posing as beautiful women on Facebook and are contacting workers at digital currency exchanges. While in the guise of a woman, they strike up online conversations with their targets in order to eventually send them files that contain malicious code. The hackers are pretty patient in their subterfuge, as noted by the director of the Seoul cybersecurity firm EST Security, Moon Jong-Hyun. He notes that the hackers often pose as students in US colleges or workers at a research think tank. He also adds: They open Facebook accounts and maintain the online friendship for months before backstabbing the targets in the end. North Korea Getting Very Aggressive Online There’s no doubt that North Korea is stepping up their attacks in cyberspace. They used to focus their attempts on gaining political and military knowledge, but the ongoing sanctions has bled the country dry, so the focus now is on stealing as much currency as possible. Bitcoinist has covered the North Korean attacks on various Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea, as well as the recent fake job offers sent to cryptocurrency executives. As Simon Choi, the director of the Seoul cybersecurity firm Hauri, notes: The North’s hacking operations are upgrading from attacks on ‘enemy states’ to a shady, lucrative moneymaking machine in the face of more sanctions. North Korean agents are also seemingly responsible for the WannaCry ransomware attacks that took control of computer systems in 150 countries back in May 2017. The Trump administration has confirmed, via an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, that North Korea was behind the attack. The op-ed states : It is based on evidence. We are not alone with our findings, either. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom attributes the attack to North Korea, and Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government. There’s just no letup with North Korea trying to grab as much loot as they can through nefarious means. As for the fake Facebook profiles, there’s no official word on how effective such attempts have been. However, the sheer patience and the use of the age-old technique of using the personae of a beautiful woman against a young, probably somewhat socially awkward man is often pretty effective. This just continues to show how far North Korea will go to steal cryptocurrency and that you should be careful who you friend on Facebook. What do you think about the latest North Korea cryptocurrency hacking attempt using fake Facebook profiles of gorgeous women? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	north-koreas-hackers-now-targeting-bitcoin	North Korea Trying to Hack Bitcoin Exchanges - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-10T05:45	In a desperate bid for financial resources, North Korea and Kim Jong-un are unleashing hackers against Bitcoin exchanges. The continuing rise in Bitcoin value has had a lot of positive effects. People have made a lot of money on the cryptocurrency’s rise, and the accompanying headlines have brought more people into the crypto world. However, there is a downside to Bitcoin skyrocketing in value, which is having unsavory characters trying to get their hands on it through illegal means. One of the more notable black hats in this regard is Kim Jong-un and North Korea, who security experts say are targeting Bitcoin exchanges due to the digital currency’s increased demand. Targeting Bitcoin North Korea used to focus their cyber espionage on traditional state activities. That all began to change in 2016, when the cyber security company FireEye began to note that North Korea began to target banks and the global financial system. 2017 has seen several attacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, and this activity has since spread to banking groups in Europe and South Korea, Bitcoin exchanges, and even an ATM company. Independent security expert Ashley Shen notes: We assume one of the reasons why Bitcoin is being attacked is because the price keeps increasing and we think it’s reasonable for hackers (to target). Digital currency might be easier to gain than physical currency. So I think it’s reasonable. Security experts have followed attacks by various hacking groups, such as Andariel, Lazarus, and Bluenoroff, and these groups are suspected to be front groups for North Korea. Shen adds: Before when we tracked nation-state attackers, they usually perform cyber attacks which are aimed at confidential data and intelligence. However recently we’ve discovered that some of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups are trying to hack financial institutions like banks and Bitcoin exchanges to gain financial profit. North Korea Needs Money While North Korea always seems to be up to some mischief, these ongoing attacks against Bitcoin exchanges is likely a sign of desperation. The country has been isolated due to crippling sanctions, and those sanctions were recently further enhanced by the Trump administration. In late November, the US government targeted 13 companies, 20 vessels, and 1 individual for engaging in trade with North Korea, At that time, US Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated: As North Korea continues to threaten international peace and security, we are steadfast in our determination to maximize economic pressure to isolate it from outside sources of trade and revenue while exposing its evasive tactics. Overall, the already meager North Korean economy has been crippled by economic sanctions. So it comes as no surprise that they wish to hack into Bitcoin exchanges in an effort to steal bitcoins as the cryptocurrency surges in value. Ashley Shen believes that such attacks are not going away any time soon, saying: My own opinion is they will probably keep doing the Bitcoins because the price keeps increasing and it’s a good investment… So I assume they will do more Bitcoin attacks and of course they will keep targeting banks because that’s what they did before.

bitcoinist	novogratz-first-cryptocurrency-merchant-bank	Novogratz Will Launch the First Cryptocurrency Merchant Bank - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-10T14:30	The advent of cryptocurrencies is triggering the creation of innovative business concepts and new Bitcoin-based financial instruments. Now, Michael Novogratz is starting a merchant bank, to be named Galaxy Digital, which will exclusively serve the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Merchant Bank Dedicated to Cryptocurrencies to Reshape the Finance World Michael Novogratz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Galaxy Investment Partners, is planning to establish and make public the first merchant bank that will focus on cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related ventures. Novogratz has already proposed a Transaction to establish Galaxy Digital as a full service, digital assets merchant bank, which will concentrate in the following areas: distinct trading, asset management, principal investment, and advisory work. A Bloomberg undisclosed source said that Novogratz “envisions Galaxy Digital as the Goldman Sachs of crypto.” And to achieve this objective: Novogratz is putting substantially all of his crypto investments into Galaxy — about $400 million of bitcoin, ether, initial coin offerings and stakes in startups such as Xapo, Bitstamp, and Ripple Labs. A Digital Assets Merchant Bank is Being Established via a Pharmaceutical Company According to Bloomberg, to set up the digital assets merchant bank, Novogratz is trying to raise capital for the amount of $200 million USD. If successful, through a holding company, he will list shares of the Galaxy Digital LP on the TSX Venture Exchange of Canada. Indeed, the digital assets merchant bank is being created combining Galaxy Digital, Vancouver-based First Coin, and Bradmer Pharmaceuticals Inc. Bradmer Pharmaceuticals Inc. entered into a letter of intent, on January 9, 2018, with Galaxy Digital LP and First Coin Capital Corp. to form a new enterprise in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. According to Bradmer Pharmaceuticals press release : The series of transactions contemplated by the Letter of Intent (the ‘Proposed Transaction’) is intended to result in Galaxy Digital and First Coin combining to form a Galaxy Digital operating partnership that will be managed by the principals of Galaxy Digital. In connection with the Proposed Transaction, Bradmer, which will acquire and hold a minority investment in Galaxy Digital, is expected to change its name to ‘Galaxy Digital Holdings’ and to resume an active public listing on the TSX Venture Exchange (the ‘TSX-V’). The growth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will most likely continue to encourage investors to create novel and ambitious crypto-based financial solutions. Historically, merchant banks dealt with commercial loans, international finances, and investments. Now, Bitcoin’s disruptive nature is triggering the creation of the first merchant bank fully dedicated to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. How do you think the establishment of a merchant bank dedicated to the cryptocurrency and blockchain space will impact Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay, CNBC.com
bitcoinist	octopocket-lets-you-use-btc-in-telegram-not-convenient-or-secure	Octopocket Lets you use BTC in Telegram, Without Convenience or Security - Bitcoinist.com	2016-03-10T10:48	10 March 2016 – Spanish Bitcoin startup Octopocket is enabling Bitcoin transactions in the ephemeral messaging app, Telegram. Their technology works without any additional software, and works through Telegram’s chat interface. Their English support is skeletal at best, and their service isn’t yet live in the US. If you want an early look, you can start a chat with their service by sending a message to @octopocket_bot via Telegram, though. Their interface and service methodology raises some security and transparency questions, as well as being comparatively uncompetitive relative to existing mobile wallets. Also Read: Bitcoin Devs Could Learn a Lot From BSD Octopocket’s Security and Trust Model is Years Behind The interface is a pretty cut and dry chatbot, with webhooks for enabling your account and support. To be perfectly honest, it doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. You have to enable the bot’s “pocket” functionality through an opaque registration page on their website, which presumably links your Telegram account’s phone number and email address to their transaction system, as far as I can tell. You can only conduct transactions using Octopocket through their Telegram bot, meaning they’ve introduced several more points of failure and parties to the trust model than strictly necessary. I’m not sure what utility they presume to offer with their service as it stands. Currently, it is more inconvenient and less secure than copy-pasting a QR code from Mycelium or another mobile wallet into telegram – if the bot goes down, if their accounting server gets hacked, or an exploit is found in Telegram’s API, Their system fails, whereas the QR code method’s only disadvantage is that the person you want to transact with knows one of your Bitcoin wallet addresses. What’s more, they store your funds in fiat currency on their end, meaning if Bitcoin fluctuates while you’re attempting to use their service, you can pay much more or less than originally intended, and you can’t make money on any deposited Bitcoin in the long term as BTC appreciates. While Octopocket offers some interesting functionality to Telegram users regarding Bitcoin, Bitcoin and mobile wallet users will likely find the service inconvenient, insecure, and inelegant compared to what they can already do with their choice of wallet. As it stands, Octopocket needs to develop a lot in terms of transparency, user-friendliness, and security before I’d consider it a good option for Bitcoin transactions on Telegram, or anywhere else. What do you think about the state of mobile Bitcoin security? Let us know in the comments! Images Courtesy Of Telegram, Octopocket
bitcoinist	oil-giant-shell-buys-blockchain	Oil Giant Shell Buys into Blockchain - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-21T06:00	Blockchain technology is no longer limited to innovative startups with grand intentions of changing the world. Massive multinationals are also looking to use the technology to improve their operations and boost productivity. The latest in the lineup to get on board the blockchain train is petro corporation Shell. According to industry portal OilPrice, the energy giant has bought up a minority share in Gartner-listed startup Applied Blockchain. Details of the deal have yet to be disclosed, but the move will enable the London startup to help Shell explore how the technology might be applied to its business. Blockchain into Business Operating for around three years now, Applied Blockchain has clients from the banking, telecoms, carmaking, manufacturing, and aerospace industries. This its first foray into energy. The technology is slowly entering into the energy sector with, according to Reuters, a consortium involving Shell, BP, and Statoil already working on the development of a blockchain-based energy commodity trading platform. Shell chief technology officer Johan Krebbers highlighted the huge potential blockchain tech has for business: Blockchain applications have huge potential to shake up how we do things in the energy industry from streamlining process, to simplifying how we work with our suppliers and serve our customers. Investing in Applied Blockchain is part of our commitment to use digitalisation to create value in our core business and develop new business models. Energy and Blockchains Shell is not the only energy company with eyes on blockchain technology. Last year, it was reported that trading house Mercuria started working with banks ING and Societe Generale on the first large oil trade based on blockchain technology. According to analysts, the marriage of blockchain and the oil and gas industry presents a number of opportunities for streamlining and improvements in cross-border payments, record management, supply chain management, and smart contracts as potential applications. Specialists at multinational professional services network Deloitte stated: A secure system that mitigates risk, increases transparency, provides an audit trail, and speeds up transactions at a significantly reduced cost may be appealing to oil and gas companies. As the crypto space expands and more companies develop blockchain solutions, the entire industry will benefit from a technology which is revolutionizing the way the world does business. Will more blockchain adoption help cryptocurrency markets? Share your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	op-ed-bitcoin-denial-stage-will-bring-us-to-bull-trap	[Op-Ed] Bitcoin: Denial Stage Will Bring Us To Bull Trap - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-29T10:00	The violent sell-off of cryptocurrencies seen recently had been expected long ago. Everybody was talking about growing bubble, everybody was trying to predict the dates and levels, but as usual, it has come up unexpectedly. Or not? Below I will name the key drivers that triggered the move and the possible scenario for most cryptocurrencies under the leadership of Bitcoin. The current Bitcoin slump is the function of mass profit taking. During the recent months, the speculative demand sped up the cryptocurrency’s growth pushing the prices up 200%-500% higher. Everybody knew it was a bubble but still kept buying up till the moment when some key figures of the crypto world came out with an official warning. And this became the start of new era for Bitcoin and Co. An Interesting Chronology of Events December, 19 – Emil Oldenburg, the Co-founder and CTO of bitcoin.com, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin websites, has sold his bitcoins saying that others will do the same when they realize how illiquid the market is. December, 20 – the San Francisco-based software engineer, whose Litecoin was founded in 2011 “sold and donated” all of his holdings over the past few days, saying he aimed at preventing a “conflict of interest”. Coincidence? Don’t Think So… These are big players, and they are also opinion leaders. Their steps and words have a significant impact on the market. And their decision to leave the market scared off some of the investors. The most cautious decided to take profit, thus triggering the domino effect. The sell-off was moderate during the first days, only gathering the pace by the weekend. For now, most digital currencies have already lost about 30%-50% of the recent bearish move, and it means the slide will be coming to an end in the nearest future. Just because all bubbles looks the same. And all investors act the same during the bubble burst. Let’s look at a quite famous picture of the behavioral patterns during the bubble blowing and bursting. The famous “Dot-Com” Bubble perfectly follows the above-mentioned stages: And now let’s look at Bitcoin chart: Doesn’t it look like we are in a “return to normal” phase? And right now we are close to a “bull trap” meaning that the correction is here but it will cover only 30%-50% of the recent sell-off. For Bitcoin it may mean the return to $17,000, but soon after we will see another round of sell-off to the levels around $5,000. So, if you are on the buy side suffering loses – you still have a chance for recovery. But don’t be too greedy – the growth phase will have limited nature. And the next stage driven by fear will bring prices to capitulation! Do you agree with the author’s assessment of Bitcoin’s next move? Where do you see prices going?

bitcoinist	op-ed-truly-i-say-to-you-that-tron-trx-is-a-terrible-investment	[Op-Ed] Truly I Say to You That Tron (TRX) Is a Terrible Investment - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-06T15:30	It’s not clear what Tron is or whether or not it takes its name directly from the science fiction movie. And that confusion extends to the company’s business model. We jump into the grid to explore why Tron’s coin-operated business is more arcade than reality. The first thing I learned about Tron the crypto company is that it has nothing to do with Tron the movie – or the game – or anything related to Tron. So why is it called Tron? I can’t figure it out either. And I am just as perplexed with their business model. Are they trying to be a decentralized social network? An entertainment hub? A content entertainment network? A Napster-like jukebox for digital content? A gaming platform? When you throw a bunch of psychedelics into the company beer keg every Friday afternoon, the result might be a competition between employees who try to out startle each other with the most bizarre messaging and inexplicable business models. Tron isn’t really a blockchain platform at all. It’s a theory. It’s not even a theory. It’s the race for a theory. It is the neon in search of an outline. A grid of competing idea cycles. And they’re giving themselves 8-10 years for one of those cycles to finish the race – yes really. By the time they’re finished with their product, we’ll have seen competitors create the sequel to the sequel to the sequel of Tron. Yet Tron’s price has grown very fast. Because their plan is fast money. They marketed it for fast money. Their first partner took fast money and their investors want fast money. And if you ever wondered what fast money would look like if it were left to its own devices, it’s Tron. But shouldn’t we cut Tron a little slack, because building the next Facebook killer is a nightmare? More correctly, it’s a cautionary tale. Tron is the story of Rumpelstiltskin, whereas every kid knows, you shouldn’t make promises you can’t keep and don’t be greedy. But what about Tron CEO, Justin Sun’s tease tweet that a Nasdaq listed company is about to partner with them? To that, I’d ask, “at what cost?” It took me 10 seconds to realize the much-touted Peiwo Huanle partnership was due to Tron’s paying them 10% of their ICO proceeds. Will this new relationship be any different? And when will it go into effect? We will announce our partnership with a very prestigious public listed company next week. Looking forward to it! — Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) January 4, 2018 Admittedly, Sun is a dream promoter of the company. He is the parable of how to promote something from nothing. When a company is too young to have any real assets, but the bravado suggests otherwise. On Twitter, Sun’s response to everything is, “we’re better”. We’re better than Bitcoin, we’re better than Facebook, we’re better than you. He’s reserved the throne next to Mark Zuckerberg, and he’s not bashful about claiming it. And Sun acts the part, doesn’t he? He sounds like Maximus from Gladiator but looks like he’s the fourth boy-next-door band member in The Little Tigers. He’s convincing and disarming at the same time. A man that is so certain of the success of his quest that he’s emphatically pointing into the stands from home plate to declare victory. So why is Tron’s price suddenly skyrocketing? Its currency price has risen over 4500% in the past 30 days. I spent a lot of time researching the company, studying the whitepaper, trying to wrest some sort of mystical reason, but it’s conspicuously absent. It’s literally buzz and hype. This is ‘Ripley’s Believe-It’ there is no ‘or Not’. This reminds me of my last visit to a contemporary art museum where I happened to meet a young, Avant Garde artist staring up at his own creation. “Don’t you see it?” he demands. “Well, not really, can you help me understand it?” I plead. “Really?” he exclaims, “It’s obvious man, it’s right there in front of you. The art defines you, it’s asking you for your interpretation, it commands it. I’m going to up-end the art world, let me tell you, I can feel it.” Perhaps. Or perhaps not. In Tron’s development schedule they list Exodus as their next phase of development. In terms of their coin, I think I’d heed that advice. The author reached out to Tron for comment and didn’t receive a reply. We welcome an on-the-record response. ARTICLE UPDATE: Rumors are circulating on whether Justin Sun sold $6 billion in TRX – we’ll update this section when we learn more. What are your thoughts on Tron? Is it a legitimate crypto project or mere smoke and mirrors? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Tron, CoinMarketCap, AdobeStock
bitcoinist	orangecoin-community-and-a-working-developer-team	OrangeCoin: A Community and a Working Developer - Bitcoinist.com	2014-05-27T22:22	OrangeCoin is a PoW/PoS coin that was released 3 weeks ago. It works with a 2 week mining phase, which has elapsed, and has a total coin count of 200 million. OrangeCoin can be bought at Bittrex at the moment at around 300 satoshi. I would also like to note that it is in cryptsy voting as well at the 6th position which is fairly good. The OrangeCoin team has been pushing towards having their coin get as much popularity as possible, and as an effect, the coin has risen by over 100% in the last few days. A few days ago, the OrangeCoin team also released a press release pretty much, in which they wrote about the upcoming innovations that will support OrangeCoin. The press release can be found here. The OrangeCoin team is working on various things at the moment. Noteworthy in the short-term are: Multipool: Of course, most PoS coins have multipools, and it is definitely a must for this coin to help raise the floor every now and then Android Wallet: The Android Wallet is more for ease of use. Who doesn’t want access to their altcoins from a smartphone? Commercial Opportunities: This one, to get businesses to accept orangecoin. Wallet Redesign: I hope they take a SilkCoin wallet approach to the wallet. Would look real good Mid and Long-Term Masternodes: I’m guessing an approach such as CAIx and DarkCoin. All masternodes are different, and it will be interesting to see how these end up Anonymous Transactions: This one is being seen all the time these days. Anonymous Coins being released, more as in anonymous features I’d guess, but it could be big My Thoughts Now, I have spoken to the developer of orangecoin regarding it, and I seem to have received some good responses from him. The developing team seems to be working hard in order to get OrangeCoin the attention it deserves. In my opinion, I believe the coin is undervalued right now, however, it is each one’s decision to buy an altcoin or not. OrangeCoin certainly has a bright future ahead of it, but whether the price compensates for it depends on the market. What we must consider when evaluating a coin is the potential for a coin to rise if it’s price drops, and that has to be considered for every coin. You can earn profit from a coin, but if you are caught off guard and end up holding some of the coins. You’d rather now that if you keep holding the coins, you will eventually make profits and not take a loss. That is what counts. The longevity of a coin is to be considered all the time, and when considering a coin such as OrangeCoin with a good developing team and a friendly community… Those are qualities you are looking for in a coin, and some coins have them. It’s just a matter of finding which ones do have them.
bitcoinist	ottawa-police-hunting-for-armed-bitcoin-robbery-suspects	Ottawa Police Hunting for Armed Bitcoin Robbery Suspects - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T08:00	Police in Ottawa, Canada, are on the manhunt for armed Bitcoin robbery suspects who staged an attempted daylight robbery of a Bitcoin financial business. The world of crypto can become a dangerous place at times. This usually occurs when someone ventures out to personally buy bitcoins from an buyer they do not know, all the while carrying quite a bit of cash. Yet even a cryptocurrency business is not a safe guarantee, as was evident by Ukrainian police seizing crypto assets from the Forklog founder recently. The latest incident of a Bitcoin robbery took place in Ottawa, Canada, where armed men tried to rob a Bitcoin business. Breaking: 1st video of what looks like a large @ottawapolice response to a commercial robbery on Colonnade Rd. Suspect believed to be in area. Video courtesy Jessa Hoffman pic.twitter.com/tQmc7N5925 — Judy Trinh (@JudyTrinhCBC) January 23, 2018 Gunning for Bitcoin On January 23rd, three men entered a Bitcoin financial business located in an industrial park in Ottawa at around 11am. (So far, the business has not been named in media reports.) All three men were armed with handguns. The robbers took control of four employees that worked at the business and bound them. One of the bound employees was hit in the head with a pistol during the ordeal. (The employee later required some medical attention at the hospital.) A fifth employee was not detected by the criminals, and he was able to contact the police. Armed Hosers on the Loose The criminals then fled the business empty-handed. Police noted that one of the Bitcoin robbery suspects fled into a nearby ravine. They were then able to track him down and arrest him. The suspect has been identified as 19-year-old Jimmy St-Hilaire. He’s been charged with the following crimes : Five (5) counts of robbery with a firearm Five (5) counts of point a firearm Five (5) counts of forcible confinement Wear disguise Conspiracy to Commit and indictable offence Carry concealed weapon Possess firearm while prohibited Possess weapon for committing an offence Possess loaded regulated firearm Ottawa Police Sgt Fernando Viera says they’re searching for a gun following yesterday’s robbery at a Bitcoin operation pic.twitter.com/hxIooG2q2N — Judy Trinh (@JudyTrinhCBC) January 24, 2018 The other two criminals are still on the lam, and the police are putting on a massive manhunt looking for them. The Ottawa police are also looking for a person of interest who was in the business when the robbery began but who later fled the scene. People who work at other businesses within the industrial park have been shaken by the Bitcoin robbery attempt, especially as it took place during daylight hours. One wonders what the criminals were hoping to gain from the robbery. It may be that the business had cash on hand to handle cryptocurrency buying and selling. Perhaps they were hoping to force the employees to transfer funds to a specific address. Whatever the reason for the robbery attempt, it is fortunate that the employees were not seriously hurt. Overall, the public’s fascination with Bitcoin, along with the massive gains it made in 2017, have emboldened some criminals to physically rob or even kidnap people in order to obtain some ill-gotten gains. Will crypto robbery attempts become an everyday occurrence? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of Twitter/@JudyTrinhCBC and Pexels.
bitcoinist	philippines-joins-ranks-countries-regulating-icos	Philippines Joins the Ranks of Countries Regulating ICOs - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-05T09:30	Initial coin offerings (ICOs) can easily net millions of dollars from enthusiastic investors, but a number of countries are starting to regulate them. The Philippines is the latest country to join this growing club. The vast surge in cryptocurrency value and popularity, especially Bitcoin, over the last couple of years took many sovereign governments and major financial institutions by surprise. The blockchain has led to a massive explosion in platforms, each looking to generate revenue through a token sale. While slow to react to this new phenomenon, a number of countries are starting to regulate these initial coin offerings (ICOs), and the Philippines is the latest one to join this list. Bitcoin Extremely Popular in the Philippines The central government in the Philippines has been looking pretty hard at cryptocurrency and ICOs for some time. The primary reason for this is that so many Filipinos working abroad have been using Bitcoin and other digital currencies to send money home as it’s quicker, easier, and cheaper than using banks. The increasing use of cryptocurrency led the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission to begin looking at ways to regulate ICOs and exchanges in order to protect consumers. SEC Commissioner Emilio Aquino recently said: This initial coin offering — depending on, as said, the facts and circumstances in which the offering is made especially in raising capital — may be considered as securities, in which case they cannot just be offered without registering with SEC… That’s the direction we’re taking, basing on the present regulations passed by the US SEC, our other counterparts in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand. Increased Oversight Becoming More Common Currently, the country’s central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, is talking with the SEC on how best to regulate and oversee ICOs. Bank commissioner Ephyro Amatong has stated: The SEC is concerned about possible unlicensed investment-taking activity or otherwise selling of investment contracts in the guise of so-called cryptocurrencies via a so-called initial coin offering. What is interesting is that cryptocurrency firms in the Philippines have welcomed this regulation. This is understandable as the country is not looking to ban ICOs (like China) but is taking steps to crack down on fraud, which helps bolster public confidence over the long haul. The regulatory movement has been spreading across the world. There’s been a global regulation effort spearheaded by the Russian Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (RACIB) that encompasses 30 countries. The United States has a cyber unit within the SEC, and the unit recently shut down the ICO of a company called PlexCorps for alleged fraud. While some may bemoan any kind of ICO regulation, it’s fully understandable that a government will actively work to stop any kind of financial scam, especially when the typical ICO can easily net millions of dollars. Of course, some cynical people might suggest that national governments are also looking to get a slice of that financial pie for themselves. What do you think about the Philippines regulating ICOs? Do you think ICOs should be regulated at all? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Wikimedia Commons, Good Free Photos, and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	pivots-towards-the-blockchain-loony-or-smart	Pivots Towards the Blockchain – Loony or Smart? - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-23T24:30	Kodak and Long Island Iced Tea have both been criticised recently for loony pivots towards the blockchain to attract feverish cryptocurrency investors. But, can you blame them when shares for the former rose as much as 90% after announcing their new KodakCoin, and the latter share-price spiked 289% after changing their name to Long Blockchain Corporation. Consequently, a cacophony of warnings about the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies has arisen as similarities between the dotcom bubble and crypto-mania become increasingly apparent. But do they really? Or is there more substance to those news than cynical haters are willing to admit? Well… It depends. Darkness Loony pivots towards the blockchain, which provide no return to investors, will occur as long as (retail) investors consider cryptocurrency and blockchain ‘buzzwords’. But, these companies should be fairly easy to identify. In short, beware of companies radically shifting their business model and/or changing their name. Where is the Light? But adding blockchain technology to existing tech business’ (‘old tech’) or even “old economy” business’ can be a fundamentally smart move. Better to recognize the disruptive nature of blockchain and decide to become the disrupter, rather than the disrupted. Many of these companies have a great opportunity to create leading cryptocurrencies and ecosystems, by combining experience and existing revenues with blockchain vision. If You Can’t Beat Them, Join Them A positive example: JDC Group (Bloomberg: A8A.GR), the largest transaction “machine” for mutual funds and insurance products in the German-speaking financial and insurance market, is about to join the blockchain movement. JDC Group already today is a technology powerhouse. Embracing blockchain is the logical next step for a company that already has the most popular digital insurance wallet in Germany. Moreover, take comfort in the knowledge that JDC has significant financial depth to make this step successful. Estimates for 2018 are approximately 110 Million Euros revenue and pre-tax earnings of 8 Million Euros. Furthermore, being able to recruit erudite Google managers to their board should not be overlooked. As they are the biggest financial sales force in Europe (16,000 independent financial advisors, 1.4 million existing retail clients), they should be easily able to equip all their clients with a crypto wallet and some JDC coins. Overnight they will become the largest crypto-wallet provider in Germany. Armed with innovative insurance products, built on cutting-edge blockchain technology, JDC revenue could rise to 200 million Euros and earnings to 20 Million Euros till 2020, analysts predict. It Pays to Be in Blockchain Companies like JDC offer an excellent opportunity to profit from the cryptocurrency boom, especially to market participants prevented from buying cryptocurrencies directly, for example, mutual funds, or to investors who find the process of purchasing a cryptocurrency cumbersome and complicated. Blockchain is the biggest investment opportunity since the broad-scale introduction of the internet 20 years ago. In the next 5 years, we will see the Google, Amazon, and Facebook of the crypto world and we all have the chance to be a part of it. How big will the blockchain industry get and who will be the major players? Let us know what you think in the comments below. Images courtesy of AdobeStock, JDC Group
bitcoinist	plaak-pre-ico-launch-generated-almost-1-million-10-days	PLAAK: How a Pre-ICO Launch Generated Almost $1 Million In 10 Days - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T09:45	PLAAK, a network developed to solve real-world problems and empower people, gained global media attention as it raised almost USD$1M in just 10 Days of Pre-ICO Launch. In Australia, and around the world, cryptocurrencies have become the new Gold Rush, changing the way we live and conduct business and transactional affairs. As a result, Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are being announced at record rates. Some are just startups riding on a dream, others already have their infrastructure and operational facilities in place. PLAAK’s one-stop shop mobile App, already in-store, played a pivotal role in the success of the pre-ICO which made international headlines. PLAAK is already on a countdown of their Pre-ICO. PLAAK is a project that began in an effort to find a solution for the perceived incompatibility of incorporating blockchain technology more cohesively into people’s everyday lives, in a constructive manner. The entire concept behind PLAAK’s decentralized and blockchain platform will be very disruptive to the freelancing marketplace, wallet exchange, investment and health sectors, and will, in fact, establish a new paradigm for doing business in those areas. PLAAK gives control back to the people, freeing them from efficiency-choking intermediaries, enabling lower operating costs and higher profits. A review of their Whitepaper supports these assertions. “The PLAAK App will be great for Service Providers and Consumers. The PLAAK ecosystem as a whole will be great for everyone. Our enhanced features will allow users to make purchases using a debit card attached to the PLAAK wallet, just as if it were fiat money. The PLAAK wallet can also be used for asset management and is not just confined to the freelance app. It is a very exciting time for PLAAK because we are creating something that hasn’t been done before. Other wallets have one problem, which is the ability to turn Digital Currency into spendable currency. We will solve that problem with the PLAAK ecosystem” said Co-Founders, Chai Shepherd, and Damian Robson. The PLAAK token account, a core component of the platform, is designed to ensure access to PLAAK’s platform. PLAAK tokens can also be used to pay the transaction fee on services made through the app, payments between participants, or during market and investment trading. It also may be the fuel for driving a secondary market via its own platform by allowing transactions using the PLAAK tokens in lieu of fiat currency, as an option. Now is the time to consider making a move to acquire PLAAK tokens at initial offering cost, during the PLAAK Pre-ICO because PLAAK is giving 41% Pre-ICO Bonus. PLAAK Tokens will be released based on the Ethereum ERC20 functionality. The PLAAK token Pre-ICO begins on January 15, 2018, and will end on February 28, 2018. However, PLAAK will officially launch their much anticipated ICO on March 1, 2018.

bitcoinist	possible-litecoin-monero-merger-steps-closer-reality	Possible Litecoin and Monero Merger Steps Closer To Reality - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-27T11:00	Charlie Lee admits his ambition to work with Monero in a series of tweets he posted yesterday, claiming that Litecoin’s liquidity would be a good fit for Monero’s anonymity and fungibility. Monero (XMR) project lead Riccardo Spagni and Litecoin (LTC) creator Charlie Lee would appear to be taking tentative baby steps in potentially bringing their two coins closer. Spagni posted the following tweet yesterday, which first bandied the idea of a possible merger between the two cryptocurrencies: Such a productive few days, finally got to sit down with @SatoshiLite and talk about a possible merger between the Litecoin Enterprise Alliance and the Monero Enterprise Alliance, which we’d obviously call the LAMEA. #blessed #justblockchainthings pic.twitter.com/yIclMHH2ke — Riccardo “fluffyblockchain” Spagni (@fluffypony) January 27, 2018 The Lite Side Lee, who has professed a desire for increased anonymity in the past with regard to Litecoin, was quick to respond in his own indomitable manner with his own series of tweets: Although @fluffypony was kidding here, I think it would be good for Litecoin and Monero (2 of the top non-scam coins 😄) to work together. A while back, I proposed to him that we work on making it easy for people to do on-chain atomic swaps of LTC and XMR in a decentralized way. https://t.co/idDn7Dmzf7 — Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite) January 27, 2018 The above tweet highlights what is quickly becoming the future direction for cryptocurrency: on-chain atomic swaps, where two different coins can theoretically be exchanged in a secure and instant manner. On-chain atomic swap technology is set to revolutionize the current crypto industry, as it was enabled by the recently enacted SegWit changes that Litecoin first tested and Bitcoin finally adopted late last year. Lee went on to elaborate on his ambition to see Monero’s unique anonymity and fungibility complement Litecoin’s liquidity: Of course, it will take some work for atomic swaps to work properly on Monero and it's up to Monero devs and community to decide if this is a good idea. If this happens, I think it's going to be huge, but no longer an unexpected surprise. 😛 — Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite) January 27, 2018 Charlie Lee’s Past Merged Mining Partnership With Dogecoin It would not be the first time that Charlie Lee has reached out to other coins for cooperative opportunities. He previously helped saved an ailing Dogecoin through allowing the two coins to be mined together. This was in the early days of pool mine swapping, where mining pools would switch to mine the most profitable coin at that precise time. Litecoin was able to offer Dogecoin a life raft while also introducing the insular community to Litecoin and the wider world of crypto. Litecoin Controversy Charlie Lee recently made headlines with his move to separate his own financial interests from the Litecoin community by selling his entire share of Litecoins. This was widely seen as him abandoning his own coin. Selling his stash was a PR move that turned very wrong for Lee in the fickle world of crypto. Lee had previously been seen as providing a strong guiding hand for the crypto community as a whole by overseeing the implementation of SegWit on Litecoin and later Bitcoin. This was a feat that involved persuading the interests of large mining operations. Much of the goodwill he had built up was brought down by accusations of self-interest and of losing faith in his own coin. If the Monero partnership goes ahead, it would save a lot of development time for Litecoin, which has its own foundation, to which Lee contributes. Yet, in turn, the development burden mentioned in Lee’s tweet would also fall to Monero as well. Are you a Litecoin owner? Would a partnership with Monero be something you would like to see?

bitcoinist	pro-crypto-professional-bitcoin-clothing-digital-currency-enthusiast	Pro Crypto - Professional Bitcoin Clothing For The Digital Currency Enthusiast - Bitcoinist.com	2015-06-21T19:00	Promoting Bitcoin and digital currency can take many forms, but one of the easiest ways of doing so is by wearing crypto-related clothing. Pro Crypto is a brand new digital currency clothing manufacturer who is trying to make a name for themselves while pushing digital currency adoption to new levels. Also read: BTC Outfitters: Bitcoin Clothing Professional Bitcoin Swag When it comes to buying any clothing, the first and foremost important aspect is whether or not the fabric quality is up to par. In the case of Pro Crypto, the fabric used in their T-Shirts is very soft and does not irritate the skin when you start sweating. Especially in the neck area, where chafing of clothes is rather the normal, there seem to be no visible marks left behind, nor is there any annoyance while wearing Pro Crypto shirts. In the world of Bitcoin and digital currency, there have been numerous efforts from individuals and companies who try their hand at creating a clothing brand. Not an easy task, mind you, as there is quite a lot of competition in this market. Plus, anyone can create a design and use platforms such as TeeSpring to have it embroidered onto a T-Shirt and sell it. But this is where Pro Crypto differentiates itself from other players in the market. Rather than using an existing platform, the Pro Crypto team opened up their web store, where they accept payments through Stripe. As you would come to expect from a digital currency-related online shop, they accept Bitcoin payments – through both Stripe and BitPay – but also credit cards. On the topic of designs, Pro Crypto offers some pretty unique designs you will not encounter anywhere else. Even though there are just over a dozen of different designs at this time, you can expect this number to increase as Pro Crypto gains more popularity and starts processing more orders. What makes the products offered by Pro Crypto of particular interest is how the designers have managed to embed their logo on the shirt, without it getting in the way of the actual design. All of the Pro Crypto shirts have the “Pro Crypto” name on the front of the shirt, near the bottom. In doing so, they make the design seem smoothless, as if “Pro Crypto” is a slogan rather than the company name. Affordable Pricing and Worldwide Shipping Creating an online clothing store means you will have to open up your products to as many people as possible. Pro Crypto can ship all orders worldwide, and they will use either USPS or FedEx for shipping and tracking. Do keep in mind that, depending on your location, delivery may take up to 20 days [through USPS]. Note from the Author: Shipping costs will vary per location, but the cheapest option – without tracking number – will cost you less than US$5 per shirt in most cases. Rather than keeping an inventory of T-shirts on-hands, Pro Crypto prints every order as it comes in. Due to this approach, it can take anywhere from two to seven days before the printing process is complete. However, as Pro Crypto becomes more popular, they will look into ways of keeping a stock of all shirts on-hand to speed up the shipping process. Depending on which design and color you want for your shirt, prices range from US$28 to US$31 per item. These prices are not exactly cheap, but it is not overly expensive either for a small start-up company. If all goes to plan, Pro Crypto will be offering women’s sizes, hoodies, and long-sleeved tees in the future. Are you planning to buy a shirt from Pro Crypto? Who (not)? Let us know in the comments below! Website: http://procrypto.net/ Images courtesy of Pro Crypto
bitcoinist	propy-launches-first-pilot-us-blockchain-land-registry	Propy Launches the First Pilot in the Us for Blockchain Land Registry - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T24:00	On 22nd January 2018, Propy Inc. (Palo Alto, California, USA) announced, that they had launched a pilot project to develop a global real estate conveyance management system and global real estate data model as a blockchain. The blockchain-based solution would revolutionize global real estate purchasing and registration processes worldwide, according to the company. The company referred to three partners having been committed to the project already, all based in Vermont, USA. City Clerk’s Office of South Burlington Agency of Commerce and Community Development Gravel & Shea PC Attorneys At Law According to the announcement of the company, their products would consist of a global real estate property store, a transaction recorder and a global land records registry that was free of jurisdiction. The report did not, however, mention how the outlaw nature of the blockchain planned to respond the issue of overlapping or conflicting interests among diverse jurisdictions worldwide, or how many of those would be interested in giving up their sole monopoly for land record management for the global blockchain-based system. The CEO of Propy Inc., Natalia Karayaneva, was quoted to have said, that the pilot project was to demonstrate how blockchain technologies can be useful in reducing costs of governance, improving the efficiency of management systems and furthermore improving their security in the way the data integrity can be guaranteed. City Clerk Donna Kinville, a representative of The City of South Burlington, VT, USA, was quoted to have said, that the city was “always interested in taking advantage of technology” to enhance delivery of its services to the residents. Furthermore, the Clerk noted, that the City of Burlington was keen to learn more during this pilot with Propy Inc. Furthermore, earlier a California-based news agency PRNewswire described The State of Vermont, USA, as having a “blockchain-friendly legislation” and that the State was “attracting innovative technology companies”. Furthermore, the agency noted, that this pilot demonstrates, that the State of Vermont has provided their full support and active participation in some technology companies. Finally, the same news agency noted, that a number of blockchain engineers from Fortune 500 companies, and other experts and industry leaders had joined the efforts of the founder of the company, Propy Inc., Natalia Karayaneva. Her relevant experience as an international real estate broker, developer and as a serial entrepreneur was mentioned in the report when describing the company and the pilot project. Along with the announcement, the company noted, that it has offices in Bulgaria within the European Union and Ukraine, in addition to the Palo Alto headquarters in California, USA. About Propy Propy is the world’s first international real-estate marketplace. The team at Propy.com facilitates connections between international entities to enable the seamless purchase of international real-estate online for the first time. It aims to solve the problems facing international real estate transactions by creating a novel unified property store and asset transfer platform for the global real-estate industry.

bitcoinist	propy-partners-vermont-implement-blockchain-based-services	Propy Partners with South Burlington, Vermont, to Implement Blockchain-based Services - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-24T24:30	The blockchain-based real estate platform, Propy, is collaborating with the city of South Burlington, Vermont, to streamline their real estate record-keeping process. Even though blockchain may be most well known for being the supporting technology of cryptocurrencies, it can be used in most industries, especially those that rely heavily on recording data. According to Cision, Propy, a blockchain-based property platform, is partnering up with the City Clerk’s Office of South Burlington in Vermont to test out the viability of using the technology to record real estate conveyance documents. Blockchain-Based Propy Breaks New Ground in Real Estate Propy is a revolutionary property platform using blockchain technology to trade properties in many countries. Transactions can be completed using both fiat and virtual currencies, making cross-border payments an easy reality. The international platform has offices in the US, Bulgaria, and Ukraine, as well as a professional team, comprising both blockchain and legal experts, that provides a secure and safe system for their clients. Excitement over New Venture The initiative is also making use of the services of Gravel & Shea, a Burlington-based legal team that specializes in blockchain-based commercial developments. Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy, had this to say: The Propy pilot will showcase the savings of blockchain distributed technology, furthering Vermont’s and the City of South Burlington’s goal to achieve more cost-effective government. In parallel to making land record management systems significantly more efficient, Propy’s additional safeguards ensure additional data integrity. Michael Schirling, who is the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary, discussed the agency’s excitement for the project: The announcement of a pilot project to utilize blockchain technology in real estate transactions is emblematic of Vermont’s long history of innovating business, insurance, and financial technology. We are fortunate to have a cutting edge statutory framework that enables the use of blockchain technology, and we will continue to work with the legislature to ensure Vermont remains at the forefront of these innovations. Donna Kinville, the City Clerk of South Burlington, touched on how this type of technology can improve service delivery: The City of South Burlington is always interested in taking advantage of technology that enhances its delivery of services to residents. We are ready to learn from this Propy pilot. Vermont Sees the Power of Blockchain Vermont has embraced the power of blockchain and continues to consider the benefits that it can offer their government, their fintech sector, and the state as a whole. By collaborating with a private blockchain-based platform, the Vermont and South Burlington governments are sending a clear message that they are more than willing to provide support to these platforms to essentially serve the greater good of the technology sector and economy of the city and state. What do you think about Vermont’s willingness to embrace blockchain technology? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Wikimedia Commons, Flickr, and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	protect-your-online-bitcoin-transactions-using-a-multisig-escrow-wallet	Use a Multisig Wallet to Protect your Bitcoin Transactions	2017-12-30T17:00	As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gain popularity as a mode of payment transfer, it has become common for the average Bitcoin user to be scammed by an anonymous identity who requests payment for some work is then never heard from again. The decentralized nature of cryptos certainly has a tradeoff – unlike a credit card or bank transaction that can be reverted, a cryptocurrency transfer once confirmed is permanently recorded on the Blockchain. This is where multi-signature (multisig) wallets come to our rescue. A multisig wallet is a special bitcoin wallet that requires more than one private key to sign transactions. Most multi-signature setups usually involve three parties – the sender of the payment, the recipient, and an escrow agent. Each of the three parties holds one private key, and to send any transaction, at least two private keys must be used. Typically, escrow agents are trusted members of the Bitcoin community or registered entities who arbitrate any disputes that may arise. Therefore, the buyer is protected in case the seller turns out to be fraudulent, and the seller, too, is assured of payment even if the buyer refuses to pay. Creating a Multisig Wallet There are many ways to create a multisig wallet. In fact, most Bitcoin clients support the multisig protocol. Electrum and Armoury are used by many crypto holders because they have provisions for advanced settings like custom fees etc. which are great for power users. BitGo is another popular option for those who prefer a web-based client. In my opinion, however, CoPay offers the most streamlined, easy to use interface, that is usable by anyone, even a new Bitcoin user. So for the purposes of this tutorial, I will be using Step 1: Download CoPay Head over to the CoPay website and download the appropriate installer for your platform. A great advantage of using CoPay is its support for nearly all desktop and mobile platforms (iOS and Android included). Step 2: Start by setting up your personal wallet Open the installed app, and run through the quick setup to create your personal wallet. This will involve typing in an email address for transaction notifications, and noting down a mnemonic phrase that can be used as a backup in case CoPay is accidentally deleted from your computer. The first few screens will help you create your CoPay Personal Wallet. Step 3: Create a Shared Wallet Multisig wallets are called ‘Shared Wallets’ in CoPay. Once your personal wallet is set up, click on the shared wallet option on the CoPay home screen to create a multisig wallet. You will be presented with a screen where you can configure the wallet with the number of co-payers, the number of signatures required etc. depending on your needs. You can customize your CoPay Wallet based on your needs. Step 4: Share the CoPay invite with others The last step is to share your multisig wallet with the 2 other parties. Send them the CoPay code displayed or ask them to scan the QR code. That’s it! Your CoPay escrow is set up! Now everytime someone requests a payment, you will receive a notification to confirm the transaction. Have you ever used a multisig wallet before? What additional steps do you take to protect your bitcoin transactions? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of CoPay, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	purse-io-purse-instant-choose-your-discount-review	Purse.io: Purse Instant and Choose Your Discount Review - Bitcoinist.com	2015-06-06T05:26	For Bitcoiners, Purse.io seems to be one of the best options for spending Bitcoin for goods, as Amazon carries almost anything you would want to buy. In addition to the ability to spend Bitcoin on Amazon products, Purse.io allows you to choose a discount rate between 1-50%. However, since Purse acts as an escrow service, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to get a 50% discount on anything. In past transactions with Purse, I’ve gotten up to a 35% discount on items that were less than $10, 30% off of items that were less than $30, and 25% off of anything higher than that. In general, the higher you set your discount, the longer it’s going to take to get your item. Purse.io works by providing an escrow service between two irreversible transactions, an Amazon purchase (once shipped, it cannot be stopped) and a Bitcoin transaction. When a shopper spends their Bitcoin, it is held in escrow until they confirm the shipment of items, at which point it is released to the buyer of the Amazon order. Disclaimer: The author received no funds from Purse or special incentive to conduct this review. Also read: Is Bitcoin Better than Gold? Part One: Transaction Costs and Centralization Purse Instant Purse has an option for instant purchase, made either directly by Purse. Purse Instant allows you to get a 5% discount on any purchase, as well as have the order filled. With the purchases I’ve made on Purse with discounts of over 25%, I’ve had to wait for over a day for a couple of them to fill. If you need your item incredibly fast, purchase something that is eligible for Prime and use Purse Instant, otherwise it isn’t worth setting a higher discount. Purse Instant is for buyers that want to spend Bitcoin on Amazon stuff and get it in 2 days. In my experience, your item will only take two more days to arrive with a 25% discount, which is worth it if you aren’t in a rush. For my test of Purse Instant, I purchased a new Star Wars shirt (in time for Star Wars day!). The order was very straight forward, and after placing it, it was filled within 5 minutes. The item shipped that very day and arrived on time as expected. I am super happy with my shirt, and, in this case, Purse Instant was essential to get the shirt before Star Wars day. While I own more than one Star Wars shirt, it’s always nice to have another. Purse Instant works as you would expect, and is probably more reliable than the “choose your discount” transactions, since the buyers are Purse staff. I had an issue with a “choose your discount” purchase a while back, in which the buyer didn’t buy one of the items on the spend order. Purse.io staff took longer than expected (and the 24-hour respond time stated on their website), but when they did respond it was quick and decisive. Purse.io has special software that can tell if an item wasn’t purchased through Amazon, so there is no clear way to cheat the system or another user. The issue between the buyer and I was resolved in a way that satisfied both parties. Choose Your Discount This is where Purse.io really shines. The ability to get up to 35% off of a purchase is incredible. Pair Purse.io with Circle, and you can purchase BTC with your bank account for free and then use that Bitcoin to save a ton on your purchases. Best of all, with Purse, you don’t even need to hold an Amazon Prime subscription, as most buyers have Prime. For the test transaction for the “choose your discount” method of purchase, I bought a very high-end travel mug, by Contigo. I chose a 30% discount off of the $20 list price. After waiting a couple of days, the order filled for just over $15 for me, a 30% saving off the original Amazon price. This transaction went without a problem, and I received my mug two days after the order filled, for a total wait time of 4 days and over $5 in savings, just by spending Bitcoin. I am very happy with this purchase; my mug keeps coffee hot for 7 hours, or cold drinks cold for 17 hours. This mug was a lifesaver for Finals Week, providing the fuel needed to study hard. Conclusion Overall, Purse.io is an incredible option for spending your Bitcoin, if you can wait, opt for a high discount. If you need the item ASAP, opt for Purse Instant, but know that you will miss out on some big savings. If you are looking for a good use of your Bitcoin for purchasing goods, Purse.io is an excellent option. What do you think about Purse.io? Comment below! Images via Purse.io and Drew Cordell.

bitcoinist	radeon-aftermarket-polaris-gpu-mining	Radeon Overview: Aftermarket Polaris Cards Shaking up GPU Mining?	2016-07-30T05:00	The Radeon RX 480 was released onto the GPU market without much fanfare, sold as a mid-range card at a low price – which is exactly how it performs. Despite the excitement in the gaming press about AMD’s Polaris architecture and the RX (and upcoming Pro WX) line of GPUs, particularly about the card’s price point, it seems to have been glossed over by the crypto mining community. Also read: The Bitcoinist Podcast is Back The 480 boasts 26-27 MH/s when put to the task of ETH mining, around 85 percent of what its older brother, the 390X, can put out at around half of the launch price. Despite the card’s promise as an efficient and inexpensive piece of mining hardware, the first batch of reference models had power delivery issues, mediocre cooling, and a lack of raw performance that raised concerns for those looking to put them to work in 24/7 mining operations. Impressive Hashpower at a Good Price Miners on the fence about Polaris will be happy to know that the AIB partner cards, as well as the cut-down RX 470 and 460, are coming to market in the next few days. These cards come with superior cooling and beefed up power delivery that makes them more desirable for mining and other intensive uses. With a lot of the initial red flags thrown up around this GPU about to become non-issues, we’ve decided to revisit the Polaris architecture and explore just how efficient and powerful the RX 480 is when it comes to GPU mining. We’ll be comparing cards utilizing the RX 200, 300 and 400 series GPUs to analyze how each generation of GCN stacks up against the next when it comes to mining Ethereum. I’ve left nVidia’s Pascal and Maxwell cards out of the benchmarks because, despite their improved hashing performance, comparisons across the manufacturers, and from OpenCL to Cuda optimized mining, is beyond the scope of this article. When looking at AMD GPU mining performance, it helps to understand the incongruity between their GPU architectures and their branding. Cards in the previous generation’s 300 series are primarily refreshes of older chips, with higher clocks and more/better memory. The 390X, a mining favorite, for example, is essentially a memory extended, overclocked 290X. The 380 is a souped-up 285 (which is the newest design from them outside of the Fury series’ Fiji Chip and the newer Polaris architecture), and the 370 is working with the same chips put into the now four-year-old HD 7000 series cards. Because each price range of card uses a different architecture, with various design time frames and iterations, you’ll see dramatic jumps between each step in their lineup, and only marginal gains from generation to generation. The newest RX 400 series is unique in that it is the first non-iterative jump in design in nearly five years for AMD, and, as you’ll soon see, it certainly shows: Polaris: New Efficiency King AMD’s Polaris 2.0 architecture shows an appreciable 28 percent raw performance improvement over the last gen 380, and an even more dramatic 51 percent improvement over the previous iteration’s 285. Of course, it’s not as simple as looking at raw hash power when evaluating mining equipment. Otherwise, the RX 480 would take a lackluster backseat to the current king in GPU mining, the 390X. What’s remarkable about the 480 is that it achieves this high level of compute performance while drawing less than half of what the 390X does at the outlet. With the latest drivers, the card only draws 159 Watts under full load, and under-volting the card further can increase its performance by stabilizing its maximum “boost” frequency. That’s right, the 480 holds the unique position of performing better with less power than the default settings. So what does this drastic reduction in power draw mean? Well, the RX 480 blows every other card in the lineup out of the water regarding efficiency. It only draws 6 watts, compared to the 390X’s 11.5 or the 285’s godawful 12.3 watts, per mega-hash, per second. The 400 series’ Polaris GPUs are as much as 104.38 percent, or 85.16 percent on average, more efficient hash-for-hash than the GCN 1.X cards of the 300 and 200 series: At the average cost of power in the US, around 10 cents per kilowatt-hour as of May 2016, you could expect to pay $440 in electricity per month for a 1 GH/s mining rig using 480s, where a similar setup using 390Xs would cost around $842 per month (this figure excludes the power draw of the other components in the system, but all things equal that’s still a $400 a month difference per GHash). With aftermarket RX 480s hitting the shelves right about now, the Polaris line of GPUs has become an incredibly attractive piece of mining hardware. It’ll be interesting to see the effects Polaris will have on large-scale operations, as well as what the 470 and 460 will bring in terms of Hashpower per watt. Questions or comments on the performance of Polaris or Pascal GPUs? Leave them in the comments! Detailed power draw data courtesy of Tom’s Hardware.
bitcoinist	razor-a-coin-with-tor-anonymity	Razor: A coin with TOR anonymity - Bitcoinist.com	2014-06-22T22:23	The first thing you need to know when speaking of Razor is what exactly TOR is. TOR is a software that enables online anonymity to hide a user’s location in anything concerning internet traffic. Mainly, TOR makes it harder for network activity to be tracked back to the user of the TOR network. You can find more information regarding TOR here. Back to the coin itself, Razor has a total coin amount of 2 million, and it is fully PoW running on the scrypt algorithm. The implementation of TOR in Razor is a great one to say the least as many coins have made a push in order to achieve anonymity. The approach taken by the Razor team is excellent as they have brought a trusted platform to many users which brings trust within the coin itself. Razor uses the TOR network to connect to clients while still using some anonymous features already seen by other coins. Innovation remains key when speaking of alternative coins, and Razor definitely has that factor making it different than the normal coin released every other day. Razor is a relatively new coin, but it has received much attention lately due to the innovation brought by it. It has been added by a variety of exchanges in its short lifetime, most notably being added by MintPal recently which saw the value of Razor grow a hefty amount. Give credit where credit is due, the technology brought by Razor is impressive, and the attention it has received is definitely justified. Not to mention the amount of hype through social networks such as Twitter. I have said it many times, value is definitely not the most important aspect of a coin, innovation is key, and to achieve innovation, a good development team has to be present as well which is, in my opinion, the situation with Razor. We have seen coins crash in value for unknown reasons even if the technology brought by them is unseen. Whether or not the coin rises in value is anyone’s guess, but we can’t ignore the revolutionary aspect brought by Razor. Definitely a coin to watch closely. The future is bright for Razor, and hopefully value doesn’t shy people from it.
bitcoinist	rcn-partners-with-decentraland-to-offer-credit-loans-on-virtual-real-estate	RCN Partners with Decentraland to Offer Credit Loans on Virtual Real Estate - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-21T24:30	It has been a busy week for popular peer-to-peer lending platform RCN. From announcing new strategic partnerships to upgrading key systems on its platform, RCN is working hard to deliver the best possible services and features to its users. RCN Announces Decentraland Partnership Earlier this week, RCN announced their new partnership with Decentraland, the blockchain-based virtual reality platform where users can acquire virtual land to create and monetize their content. In addition to exploring and interacting with Decetraland’s 3D virtual world, users can also purchase land as well, creating an immutable record of ownership on the Ethereum blockchain. Decentraland’s unique VR platform has strong support among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, gamers, and real estate developers. Under the new partnership, RCN will be able to integrate its credit protocol with the Decentraland platform. This will enable users who own plots of land, content, or businesses created in the 3D world to issue and receive loans. Development of this “virtual loans network” is expected to begin in Q2 2018. Decentraland Project Lead Ariel Meilich spoke about the partnership, stating: We’re really excited to work with the RCN team. Their project is one the most interesting ventures made on crypto and I believe that, once combined with ours, it will bring great value and open some really cool opportunities to the Decentraland ecosystem. RCN Platform Upgrades As you no doubt know, the Ethereum blockchain has been receiving an unusually high number of transactions over the last few weeks. This is due to a combination of the recent ETH price rally as well as the CryptoKitties phenomenon that has swept through the crypto community. These significant delays resulted in some of the RCN credit loans not being funded. Previously, whenever certain lending transactions remained pending, all actions taken by the same lender would fail due to a larger nonce. To address the issue, the RCN development team has made some improvements in the exchange transaction generation process, managing the nonce of all transactions, and adjusting the gas price setting model used by the platform. RCN believes that these upgrades will improve performance, speed up transactions, and reduce withdrawal and collection fail rates. What do you think of RCN’s new partnership with Decentraland? What are the possible use case scenarios for the planned virtual lending network? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Decentraland, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	ready-player-one-crypto-solution-pc-game-resales	Crypto solution for PC game resales	2018-01-22T05:00	The number of applications for blockchain technology is simply staggering, and new ones are being launched every day. The latest development for implementation of the blockchain is a gaming platform whereby users can resell digital titles in a decentralized marketplace. Steam is the dominant force in PC games today, and the online marketplace has over 18 million users at peak times, according to its stats page. There are over 1,600 games available for sale and download on Steam. However, unlike with physical CDs and DVDs of game titles, there is no way players can resell their digitally downloaded games after they have been completed. Robot Cache Robot Cache According to reports, a new Steam rival called Robot Cache has been unveiled, which claims to be the first decentralized PC games distribution platform. Founded by InExile Entertainment boss Brian Fargo and backed by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, the company has some ambitious plans, including a game resale service. CEO Lee Jacobson said that the main goal of the company is to leverage the power of blockchain to provide more flexibility and transparency to PC gaming. The ability to resell digital titles and get some of their money back will be a boon for gamers who currently are stuck with them once a game has been completed. Using a blockchain to decentralize the service will enable the company to reduce operating costs and the fees that publishers and developers pay. Steam currently takes a 30% revenue cut, so according to Robot Cache: Everyone from the smallest indie team to the biggest publishers, will retain up to 95 per cent of the sales proceeds, which is 25% higher than the current industry standard. Building Blocks Just like in Minecraft, the business needs to be built from the base up and offering developers and publishers more of their money back is a good start. To entice gamers on board is the ability to resell their titles to get some remuneration. According to Robot Cache, publishers will receive 70% of the resale proceeds, and players will get a 25% cut of the revenue. The stipulation and only possible drawback is that the re-seller’s payment comes in the form of the company’s new cryptocurrency token, IRON, and prices will be determined by Robot Cache. The economy on the gaming distribution platform will be driven by IRON, and users can trade it, mine it, or purchase new games with it. Robot Cache claims to have all of the latest titles available when it launches in the second quarter of 2018, but only time will tell if gamers can be drawn away from their existing online stores, such as Steam. Is Robot Cache a great idea or will PC games players stick to Steam? Share your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pexels, Bitcoinist archives, and Robot Cache.
bitcoinist	reason-trading-platform-become-imaginative-business-model-interpreted-successive-financing-head-digital-asset-trading-platform	The Reason for The Trading Platform to Become the Most Imaginative Business Model Interpreted from Successive Financing of The Head Digital Asset Trading Platform - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-28T21:30	Recently, Bit-Z, a globally digital asset trading platform, has obtained an investment of more than Us $10 million from three international investment institutions. The three investors were Hwazing Capital Limited, Wa Sung Investment Limited, and Plum Angel Investment Co., Ltd. As shown by the online platform, Bit-Z was founded in 2016 and has been a leading digital asset trading platform in trading volume around the world. It is mainly engaged in offering digital asset trading crypto-to-crypto trading service for users in the world. The so-called crypto-to-crypto trading refers to a trading mode in which a blockchain asset is directly used for exchanging another kind of blockchain asset without involving transit or settlement of legal currency in the course. Presently, Bit-Z has operated for nearly one year, with users to access the website centralized in USA, UK, France, Spain, Brazil and other countries. The Asian users are mainly concentrated in China, Korea, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Security and Stability Are Basic Qualities of a Trading Platform During the daily trading, the biggest pain points for users are security and convenience. The more internalized platform will be confronted with greater challenges in security and stability. To this end, Bit-Z platform adopts bank-level SSL security connections for ensuring the security of user transactions. Meanwhile, it adopts GSLB and distributed server for ensuring the stability of the platform. To be specific, the technical features of Bit-Z include multi-cluster architecture, high-speed memory match-making engine; besides, the designed distributed wallet can ensure timely charging-in and charging-out. The distributed micro-service-based architecture is characterized by high performance. high availability and easy scalability etc. Meanwhile, the visualized monitoring system embedded therein can provide real-time monitoring service, capture abnormal conditions and carry out alarm operation so as to ensure the system to run in an efficient and stable manner. Core Significance of Trading Platform If ensuring of stable and convenient transactions is a basic quality of a trading platform, screening of high-quality projects shall be an essential significance for a trading platform to exist and also an indicator of its core competitiveness. However, under the situation, that currency types are inundate, the charging of currency launch fees has been one of hidden rules and also denounced by some users who hold it to be unfair. However, to be different from other trading platforms, Bit-Z adopts voting way to achieve free currency launch and have the users to decide the currency types to be launched for online trading without any additional expenses; the platform will carry out comprehensive risk control and management from the team, history, product, strategy, potential and other aspects of the blockchain project, give an effective guidance to the platform’s global users for making investments in a scientific way and safeguard the security of users in transactions. Just like the most essential thinking of blockchain – decentralization, the way for deciding the launch of currency type by voting is also an embodiment of decentralization. The decision-making power has been assigned to the scattered users and the decision is not made by centralized decision-making mechanism anymore. In this way, users will grasp the gaming rules and dominate the market development. Bit-Z platform has opened 4 trading markets: BTC market, DKKT market, ETH market and USDT market. As shown by data of Coinmarketcap, there are more than 60 currency types under online trading through Bit-Z platform. Besides BTC, ETH and other mainstream trading zones, the project launched by the platform also includes DKK Token (DKKT). It is a token based on Danish Krone (DKK), a stable value currency, with an exchange rate of 1 DKKT=1 DKK. DKKT aims at providing a stable digital currency solution and promoting the practical application of blockchain technology in traditional finance, politics, law, social science, science and other fields. The most typical feature is that it is almost equivalent to Renminbi, 1 DKK ≈ 1 RMB, allowing it to be a good value-preserving token in the volatile crypto-currency market. A senior insider told me that the current head trading platforms in the sector have strong technical strength. They have usually built a technical team for carefully reviewing the code of a candidate token. As a matter of fact, building a good trading platform system is helpful to squeezing the moisture out of the sector. Coincidentally, in the earlier days, another head digital asset trading platform also announced its completion of a new round of fund-raising. This indicates that, even during a period when the policy remains unclear, a number of trading platforms including Bit-Z have obtained the investment of top investment institutions in succession. For VCs, they usually bet on the key sectors in the next five years. It also indicates that the blockchain sector will be under a state of relative disorder and chaos within the short term, but it has a promo sing prospect in the long-term run. Various countries in the world have different policies to deal with blockchain assets, however, some countries have been at the forefront. For instance, Japan has released licenses to trading platforms; Bit licenses have also been issued in some states of USA. Along with the implementation of a licensing system in Japan and USA, it has more proved that the blockchain assets enjoy a huge potential for development in the future. As for blockchain technology, the founder of Tripod Advisors David Schlesinger noted that blockchain is just like a beehive, in which all the cells are interconnected. If one of the cells disappears or is damaged, attention will be drawn immediately. The hive will not be completed anymore. As a consensus on blockchain technology has been increasingly reached in the whole society, the ecosystem of the blockchain has become more and more perfect and the demand for issuing and trading of the token has also been more vigorous. For digital currency trading platforms, the significance of their existence lies in that it cannot only promote the sound development of the industry but also share the dividend of the sector and keep a good profitability. For blockchain, one of the major advantages with great hope is pinned its decentralization, with no intermediaries getting involved therein. In this case, token plays its function of rewarding and bookkeeping, which enables all the nodes of the chain to be motivated in getting involved in bookkeeping. If the token has been taken off, it needs a third party to play the function of bookkeeping, that will be a mode of centralized organizational structure, which will lose the value of blockchain which is mostly concerned. Just because of this, the token is a cornerstone to keep a huge blockchain system in operation. As a cornerstone, it shall be liquid. In this case, the trading platform shall play its role of pivot, with one side corresponding to fund suppliers and another side corresponding to providers of innovation projects. The trading platforms will deliver the inexhaustible sources to the parties of technical innovation and enable the fund providers to appropriately share the results of technological progress. Only such a resource allocation mechanism can ensure the blockchain technology to develop in a sound and sustainable way. Presently, the sector is still in an early stage, so currencies of bubble and air are inevitable. Gain by only relying on a concept will result in bubbles and trigger some discussions adverse to the sector. However, at a stage that the sector varies in level, the significance of trading platforms will be particularly prominent. If trading platforms persist in screening and selecting high-quality projects, they will have opportunities to make good money drive bad one out and clear off the chaos of the market. Imaginary Space for Business of Trading Platforms The pivotal role of trading platforms also means that trading platform is a business model with typical Matthew Effect. The commercial rules of high user stickiness, high migration cost, and the strong-remaining-strong will prevail here, thus, for digital asset trading platforms including POLONIEX, Bittrex, and Bit-Z etc. For crypto-to-crypto trading, time will be their friend. Many people think that application and implementation are insufficient for blockchain sector presently. Such an argument has actually ignored the existence of trading platforms. In fact, the trading platform itself has been a well-established application. It not only envoys stronger technical team and can bear high concurrency transactions, but also makes more profits. Compared with a lot of business models’ difficulty in implementation and the profitable prospect at an indefinite date in the future, the trading platform is currently occupying a favorable position in the blockchain field. Presently, the market value of blockchain assets is around US$300 billion, more than 70 times of that 3 years ago. Through the development of blockchain application over the past years, the market value of blockchain assets is expected to reach up to a size of 10 trillion in the coming 2-3 years, exceeding the volume of gold today. The demand of people for allocation of digital assets continues to rise, which can be found from the 24-hour turnover of a few head platforms in crypto-to-crypto trading. Blockchain is an interesting sector indeed. The rule of internet giants-taking-all, a popular one in centralized model, ceases to be effective here. For miner sector, digital currency sector or trading platform, few internet giants have got involved in. On the one hand, they know less about it; on the other hand, the giants are not willing to put their arrogant status aside. Today, along with the rise of several trading platforms and mainstream digital currencies, these marginal forces are stepping to the center of historic stage.

bitcoinist	revain-releases-dashboard-version-0-4	Revain Releases Dashboard Version 0.4 - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T08:00	Moscow, Russian Federation, January 29th, 2018 – The first release of 2018 is here. Today Revain is announcing next step in the development of its blockchain-based review platform. The company just released version 0.4 of its flagship Dashboard service. After several iterations aimed to test some core functions, Revain is finally adding first 15 projects to the platform. A few new things were included in v0.4. The starting page was relocated from Revain project’s page to the page with a list of all tokens which were added on the platform with some basic information such as rating, volume, today’s and ICO price, open source activity. Users can choose a project and review all the statistics about it as well as authentic and qualitative feedback provided by other token holders. Next. Dashboard overall user interface and design were improved. The search line was redesigned. Some user interface changes were made, such as second ‘add review’ button for user’s convenience was moved to the bottom of the site, new animations were added, etc. Finally. Dashboard got sharing buttons. Users can share different statistic and performance of the token which they hold through social media channels. We are really gaining momentum with the platform’s progress as development becomes more complex and sophisticated. Release 0.4 is available here: https://dashboard.revain.org/ About Revain Revain is aimed to revolutionize online reviews using blockchain technology. Its platform is designed for accumulating authentic user reviews on projects and startups that have concluded their crowdfunding / ICO stage. The platform is bringing to life the service that will finally allow businesses to receive detailed and genuine feedback about their projects, while users will get access to other people’s experience with ICOs and share their own insights as well. The platform will be aggregating information on token dynamics and major milestones in startup’s development. Revain released version 0.3 of the platform in December 2017 with a target to deliver full release 1.0 as early as Q2 2018.

bitcoinist	review-avalon-4-1-1-ths-bitcoin-asic-miner-quiet-power	Review: Avalon 4.1, 1 th/s Bitcoin ASIC Miner, Quiet Power - Bitcoinist.com	2015-03-17T15:00	Avalon has a storied name in the Bitcoin ASIC Mining industry. As one of the first companies to produce and ship ASIC gear, they had several models that were excellent sellers. Simple to use and powerful at the same time. Other manufacturers have stepped up in power and performance since those days. Canaan Creative CO., LTD the company behind the current Avalon name released not too long ago the Avalon 4.1 Bitcoin ASIC miner. The Avalon 4.1 is similar in design to the Spondoolies-Tech SP20. What makes it different is the 4.1’s speed and physical size. It is larger in physical size than the SP20. The specs are nice for a current gen miners as well. While not quite as good as an S5 in terms of power to gh/s ratio it is close. Also Read: Spondoolies-Tech SP20 Jackson Video Review and Discussion Avalon 4.1 and UART Specifications: Avalon 4.1, 1 th/s Bitcoin ASIC Miner Hash Rate: 1000 GH/s ±5% Power Consumption: 560W to 630W: Stock Speed Power Efficiency: 0.7 watt/GH Chips 40x 28nm Avalon 4 A2322 Rated Voltage: 12V Dimensions: 395 mm x 160 mm x 165 mm Cooling: 1x 120mx38mm NMB-MAT7 Operating Conditions: 0 °C to 35 °C Requires a separate RPi, WR703N Router w/ Custom Firmware or PC The Avalon 4.1 runs at roughly 1 th/s at stock settings with excellent overclock and underclock performance as well. Underclocking is key especially when BTC value is lower and making a profit above electricity costs is paramount. The shipping gods were having a good day as the miner arrived safely. The shipping box securely protects the Avalon from damage and bouncing around too much while in transit. Avalon 4.1 GUI When opening the box, you will find the miner as well as the USB UART adapter and cables to plug into your choice of controller. Running the Avalon 4 requires a separate RPi or WR703N Router w/ Custom Firmware or PC. For this review, we used the RPi (Raspberry Pi) image. The Avalon 4 like the Antminer S5 runs on much less power than the previous gen miners. At the stock freq the Avalon 4 ran at 1 th/s and pulled 633 watts at the wall. We used an EVGA 1300watt Supernova PSU for the review. Another nice feature of the Avalon is how quiet it runs. The miner tested at 42 dB at 4 feet on stock settings and only 48 dB on turbo settings. With the Antminer S4 and the SP20, they are much much louder making them not much of an option for inhabited rooms in your house. While underclocking the miner, it actually went down to 39 dB at 4 feet. Very manageable and will not cause a divorce if you have a couple in the house. The Avalon can achieve this by using a very efficient fan and a larger housing than the SP20. Avalon 4.1 Antpool Normally we talk about the ease of setting up the miner before the speed but in this case we saved it for last because of the underclocking that can be done with the Avalon 4.1. The image for the RPi is interesting in that it offers two ways to setup and use your miner. The default is the Avalon interface that is simple. It gives excellent graphs and real-time stats with a simple panel for the pool config and network setups. The RPi controller defaults to 192.168.0.100 so if you use a different IP range for your network you will want to pop it over and set the image to DHCP or a static IP of your choice. Another nice element is the ability to run several of the miners from one RPi or another controller. The USB dongle allows for use with the different controllers. ASICMiner used one that was similar, but the Canaan-Creative USB dongle is more refined as well as having indicator lights to let you know if it is working properly or not. The miner also allows you to chain them together much the way the BTCGarden miners were chain-able. Avalon refined this as well over the BTCGardens. Avalon 4.1 Advanced Interface With the advanced mode of the Avalon 4.1, you will see a familiar interface to many miners. The skinned cgminer much like Bitmain uses. The Avalon in the pool selection screen has a simple selection for modes. Custom, Eco, Normal, and Turbo. Each one will give you different speeds easily without messing around. In Eco mode, we were able to get 510 gh/s at 252 watts at the wall. The Eco setting makes it nearly 0.48 watt/GH. Add in the very quiet performance, and you have a very attractive miner for the energy conscious. The Avalon 4.1 we also pushed in overclocking and were able to reach 1.36 th/s stable with Turbo mode. The power consumption hit in the 1170watt range. Still respectable but not earth shattering. With the custom setting and a server PSU, we were able to get the miner up to 1.42 th/s. As always with overclocking and even underclocking do so at your own risk. The Avalon 4.1 is a solidly built, excellently performing and feature rich Bitcoin ASIC miner. We used the miner on BTCGuild, AntPool, and NastyPool. The miner performed within 2% on each pool on average with no compatibility issues. I recommend this miner for home use to large installations. The simple setup and feature rich control software is excellent. There are so many settings and fine tuning things you can do that it makes it very powerful. Initially, the controller software that was first released was a bit buggy but Canaan-Creative on the customer services side is also top notch. They keep working to improve the software after the sale so their customers can get their monies worth. Cost is where the biggest drawback comes in. Currently (although it may change) the Avalon 4.1 is priced more than other miners such as the SP20 (now sold out) or the Antminer S5. It is not a huge amount but enough to put the gh/s to cost ratio a bit above the others. Of note though is Avalon is shipping them now, there is no pre-order like the S5 or being sold out as the SP20. This fact is a good thing for those looking to mine now. Neither Bitcoinist nor this author makes any claimes of ROI.

bitcoinist	review-ledger-wallet-secure-bitcoin-hardware-wallet	Review: Ledger Wallet, Secure Bitcoin Hardware Wallet - Bitcoinist.com	2015-04-13T14:00	I had an opportunity to review a Ledger Nano hardware wallet. The wallet itself, which sells (with shipping) for about $51, features unique software paired with a physical USB stick. The wallet cannot be opened if the USB isn’t plugged in, making it so that a thief would need physical access to even attempt to gain control of your funds. The ledger wallet is locked with a pin code, enter it wrong three times and the contents of the USB stick are wiped. Each ledger comes with a recovery sheet to write the 24 word seed recovery phrase on. I would highly recommend making additional encrypted digital copies and distributing them in multiple places you can trust. The recovery phrase can be imported into an HD wallet. Once it has been imported, the security card that comes with the Nano is no longer necessary. Disclosure: The author was sent a Ledger Nano for review free of cost. The author nor Bitcoinist received any compensation from Ledger for writing this review. Also see: Trezor Video Review When you create a wallet on the physical USB drive, be sure to create it on a computer you can trust. Creation of the wallet is the step where security is most crucial; once your wallet is created, everything else is designed with security in mind. The Ledger wallet runs on a Chrome app (free of course) and can only be used online. Each wallet features a unique security card that creates a second authentication process in order to send funds from the ledger wallet. Even if someone stole your USB stick and knew your pin code, they still wouldn’t be able to move your funds. The recovery phrase and security code that are written in the recovery sheet allow you to recover the wallet in another Ledger wallet or any other HD wallet. Ledger will replace security cards if they are lost, as long as you don’t lose your security code. Even if the company were to fall apart, funds could still be moved by importing the wallet into another HD wallet. Keeping the private seed phrase secure is absolutely necessary — the recovery sheet should be stored somewhere secure and away from the physical ledger wallet. One thing that I like about the wallet is the fact that the Ledger software issues the physical USB device a cryptographic challenge that verifies the authenticity of the firmware. This feature is most important for when you get the package in the mail. If someone were to intercept the package and tamper with the Ledger USB stick, it wouldn’t open the wallet due to the cryptographic test. This feature allows users to know that the hardware is safe and secure upon arrival. I had a couple of issues with installing a firmware update when I got the wallet; it was probably due to something I did wrong or the computer I tested it on. Though this may appear to be a negative thing, the customer service at Ledger is incredible. They went out of their way to help me resolve the issue quickly and were extremely helpful. I tested the wallet moving funds back and forth. Upon sending BTC from the ledger wallet, the user is required to enter the four digits from the security card, preventing funds from being moved if someone was trying to steal them. An extra layer of security is always nice, and this wallet is very good for the price. The USB itself is well made, created from metal and plastic. It is of higher quality than most USB sticks, rated to last for 500,000 read/write cycles, or 30 years. If treated well, there is no reason it shouldn’t last longer than that. As stated before, even if the wallet is destroyed, it can be imported into another HD wallet. Sending and receiving funds is easy, the extra factor of the security card makes transactions more secure without hindering the user. Pros Great security for the cost Relatively low cost Quality materials Excellent customer support Easy to use Beautiful user interface Cons Must be set up on a computer you trust 100% Wallet software does not include the option to show any fiat values for any transaction. Can only run from Chrome Overall, the Ledger wallet is very well made and offers great value for the price. In terms of security and ease of use, it is a great alternative to the TREZOR for those looking for excellent security without breaking the bank. As long as the computer you set the wallet up on is secure, the Ledger Nano will be a very safe method of storing your bitcoin. Hopefully, Ledger will add the option to see fiat the value of transactions within the wallet software in the near future. I tested the Ledger wallet on a Windows 8 laptop, a Windows 7 desktop, and a Chromebook; the wallet works well on all of them. You can learn more about Ledger Wallets here. Have you used the Ledger wallet? If so, what do you think about it? Let us know in the comments below! Images via Ledger Wallet and Drew Cordell.
bitcoinist	revolutionizing-music-streaming-with-voise-the-first-music-platform-on-the-ethereum-blockchain	Revolutionizing Music Streaming with Voise, the First Music Platform on the Ethereum Blockchain - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-24T15:30	Artists not getting fairly paid for their content is a growing problem today, as music streaming services are cutting them out. Voise has a solution that will put the power back in the artist’s hands. Taking Advantage of Artists We live in an age where music creators aren’t getting paid the revenue they deserve for their work. The most recent lawsuit against Spotify is great evidence of that, with Wixen Music Publishing launching a $1.6 billion case. The company represents popular artists who are being taken advantage of, such as Neil Young, The Black Keys, and Tom Petty. And this is only the most recent accusation. Spotify has been plagued for over a year with people upset about how they compensate the artists that make up their entire company. This is where Voise looks to innovate. Their platform is based on the Ethereum blockchain and provides an avenue for artists to publish their work for fans and make 100% of the revenue. It runs via a smart contract, so once the platform is launched people will be able to verify the software for themselves. How Voise Works On the Voise platform, artists have complete control. If they decide to publish their work to the network, they upload the file and it is published over a peer-to-peer network. People can browse the uploads to find music to their liking, and can even listen to samples before purchasing. VOISE tokens can be used to pay the artists for their content, with every transaction being published to the Ethereum blockchain. Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds will subsequently be sent to the artist’s wallet. The artist will be getting every single penny paid, minus a small transaction fee to broadcast the transaction. On Voise, an artist can set their own prices and decide how they want to offer samples to their fans. They can even set up a “donation” system, with a small 30-second clip being available initially and after a donation the entire song becomes available. This music library will be open to everyone around the world, subverting the banning of some established music providers in some countries. The key piece here is the decentralized nature of the network. Unlike a traditional streaming service where, if it shuts down, your music is gone, with Voise the entire music library will be hosted via a peer-to-peer network, so your music will always be accessible. Unlike many crypto projects, the team behind Voise recognizes that this service is not only in demand for digital currency enthusiasts, but the rest of the technically illiterate public. Most people around the world have no idea what Bitcoin is, let alone how to buy, store, and use it. In time, the Voise platform is also set to integrate fiat payments to further open the platform to as many people as possible. Another nifty feature of Voise is the DAO Radio. This feature allows users to vote on music via the blockchain, letting people rate current songs on a public playlist and vote for new songs to get added. A leaderless radio station, if you will January 24th $VOISE is listed on a top 5 exchange! 🚀🚀🚀 Bob approves. 📈 pic.twitter.com/qWfpEhcsNZ — Blockchainarticles (@Blockarticles) January 18, 2018 Voise launched an ICO earlier last year, and the tokens that came from it will be the best way to interact with the platform. You can buy the tokens on exchanges such as HitBTC, Cryptopia, and EtherDelta, with more exchanges planning support. The current supply of Voise is just around 643,000,000, with occasional coin burns by the dev team driving down the supply even more. Do you think this platform would disrupt the current music streaming industry? Would you use this? Let us know in the comments down below! Images courtesy of Voise
bitcoinist	ripple-adds-new-partners-xrapid-project	Ripple Adds New Partners for xRapid Project - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T03:00	Most of the news about Ripple has been negative over the past month. The company’s XRP token has fallen from its great height by over 65%, so it is in need of a boost. That came this week when Ripple announced two new partnerships for its xRapid pilot project. According to reports, a telecommunications company and an international payments specialist will be the latest to use Ripple’s highly volatile currency as part of their money transfer operations. The companies are publicly traded IDT Corp, a New Jersey-based telecommunications provider, and MercuryFX, which offers discounted foreign exchange rates. xRapid Project Ripple has launched a project called xRapid which facilitates global money transfers by using XRP as an intermediary currency. As the remittance market grows, so does the need for instant, low cost, and transparent transfers. According to the company blog, global remittances, which include flows to high-income countries, were estimated to be $596 billion in 2017. Ripple claims that with xRapid and XRP, financial institutions can eliminate the need for costly intermediaries or pre-funded Nostro accounts in destination currencies. New Partners The addition of new partners who will be actively using xRapid and XRP is paramount for Ripple, which needs to steer away from the notion of its cryptocurrency being just a vehicle for speculation. Leading global currency exchange provider MercuryFX wants to develop a more efficient and transparent customer service that works in real time. CEO and founder Alastair Constance said: Ripple, XRP and fiat currency fit hand in glove. What we’re doing together is realizing one of the best use cases for frictionless transactions, which is international settlement. xRapid allows us to drive down the cost of currency exchange and global settlement, making our customers more competitive and saving them tens of millions of dollars each year. Digital assets promise fast transaction speeds but XRP is far faster than all of them, including bitcoin. Cutting settlement times from hours and days to just three seconds or less will remove billions of dollars in unnecessary intermediary fees. Telecommunications company IDT also want make sure their customers can send low cost global payments. Senior vice president of IDT’s consumer payments business, Alfredo O’Hagan, said : Our BOSS Revolution international money transfer business routinely utilizes digital assets to generate liquidity in fiat currencies for our disbursement agents as part of our transaction settlement process. We’re excited to pilot Ripple’s xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost. XRP is currently trading at $1.44, down from a high on Jan 18th of $1.92. Its market capacity is currently $56.1 billion, according to Livecoinwatch.com.

bitcoinist	ripple-dethrones-ethereum-now-2-cryptocurrency-behind-bitcoin	Ripple Dethrones Ethereum, Now #2 Cryptocurrency Behind Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-29T16:30	Ripple just became the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency. This is a big deal. But why? Is Ripple a good investment? Will banks adopt it? Let’s find out. Why Is Ripple Causing Waves? While Bitcoin and the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies are well below their peak, Ripple is enjoying a meteoric rise and is trading at $ 2.22, up more than 49% from this time yesterday. In fact, it just unseated Ethereum as the #2 cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. So why is Ripple’s current so strong? 6 Reasons Why Ripple’s Tide is Rising There are a number of factors that could be contributing to the sudden rise in Ripple’s price, but here are the six most likely reasons: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s appearance on CNBC to explain to a mainstream investment audience the advantages of Ripple over the current system. His example of outrageous cross-border ATM fees and the amount of time it takes to send money from New York to London resonated with a financially savvy audience. It also helps that Garlinghouse looks and sounds like a Wall Street insider. Most cryptocurrency transaction fees are high and burdensome, while Ripple’s are some of the lowest available. Ripple claims banks can save an average of $3.76 per payment using their network. If you’re going to use cryptocurrency for international payments, there isn’t a real competitor to Ripple. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the dialups of cryptocurrency. A transaction can sometimes take up to 30 – 40 minutes to clear with ETH and an hour or more with BTC, whereas it takes only seconds with Ripple’s XRP. Amid that aggravation, Ripple’s daily transaction volume has soared from 150,000 to more than 1,050,000 in the last few weeks. Asia’s role in the run-up cannot be understated. Last year Ripple partnered with SBI Holdings to launch SBI Ripple Asia which is a dedicated sales and engineering venture to serve countries like Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. The Ripple Asia tests begin next quarter so I believe there is some built in anticipation. American Express’ adoption of Ripple is helping to legitimize the cryptocurrency because it will offer its millions of users’ instant block-chain based payments. Rumors that Coinbase will soon support Ripple may be adding to the runup. For perspective, look at what happened when Bitcoin Cash was added to the largest Crypto Platform. If you would have told me 3 months ago that Ripple would surpass Ethereum in market cap by the end of 2017, I would have had a long laugh at your expense. But clearly, the joke is on me. But not everyone is convinced. Take this tweet from Ryan Selkis who claims he knows of no banks that are using it or plan to use it. Buyer beware! Per a source at one of the major banks re XRP: "I know of no banks that are a) using it, or b) would touch it in any way as it is controlled by a SV company and 20% of all XRP in existence were taken by the founders. — Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) December 29, 2017 So what do you think? Is Ripple for real? Will it’s run-up continue? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of CoinMarketCap, Flickr/Karen Blaha
bitcoinist	ripple-reaches-sky	Ripple Reaches for the Sky - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-22T02:00	The past couple of days have seen market corrections across the board as Bitcoin and its altcoin brethren pull back from all-time highs earlier in the week. As panic and hysteria ripples through social media crypto groups, largely populated by inexperienced traders, those holding Ripple have reason to smile. Ripple’s XRP token has surpassed Bitcoin Cash by market capacity in the past few hours, surging 28% to an all-time peak of $1.38. At the time of writing, it is in third place in the crypto charts, boasting a market cap of $46.4 billion, ahead of BCH with its $44.3 billion. One in Five Four of the top five cryptocurrencies have been suffering an attack of the bears for the past day or so, except XRP, which is extremely bullish. Since the end of May, Ripple had been slumbering in a channel between $0.15 and $0.28. There had been no momentum in either direction, and many had almost written off the altcoin. Things started to happen around December 12th when key resistance was broken, and XRP headed towards its previous high back in May of $0.40. This month alone, it has jumped almost 475% from $0.24 at the beginning of December to a Ripple record of $1.38 a couple of hours ago, according to Coinmarketcap. Around $3.6 billion have been traded in Ripple in the past 24 hours alone. Asian Appetite News that over 60 banks in Japan and South Korea would be using the Ripple blockchain to test inter-bank transfers sent the price soaring last week. Over a quarter of all crypto trade volume comes from these two countries alone, so it is pretty obvious where the impetus has come from. Ripple has been boosted recently by large trading volumes at South Korean exchange Bithumb and Hong Kong-based Bitfinex. Additionally, news that XRP may be listed on Coinbase when it opens the platform to new altcoins next year would have also have an impact. Ripple is one of the oldest and most established of all cryptocurrencies, so investors have made it one of their targets for long trades. Once large exchanges such as Coinbase add support for altcoins, their exposure to the public is greatly increased. The easier it is to buy them, the more volume we will see. Many are skeptical about Ripple due to its involvement with traditional banking institutions, but they will be taking notice now as it is the only green coin in a sea of red today. Does XRP go against crypto ethos or would you buy it? How do you explain its surge while other coins fall? Tell us your thoughts below.

bitcoinist	ripple-soars-xrp-holders	Ripple Soars 445% in 2 Weeks, But XRP Holders Won't Like This Article - Bitcoinist.com	2017-05-17T09:00	The Ripple cryptocurrency XRP has been the center of attentions, rallying to unprecedented heights over the last month but what is truly fueling the rally? [Note: This is an Op-Ed] XRP Shoots Up 445% Ripple has been enjoying a phenomenal month on the price charts, constantly breaking all time highs and dominating daily trading volume. Although recent times have been filled with exciting rallies, XRP has overshadowed every altcoin out there, growing over 445%% in two weeks, making it the second most valuable cryptocurrency with a marketcap of roughly $14 billion. The rally experienced in the XRP price charts can be attributed to recent news on the cryptoshpere like the addition of new customers (banks, and payment service providers) to the Ripple network. This also includes news of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, which recently joined Ripple’s Interbank Group for Global Payments, and the announcement to lock a large portion of the company-owned XRP tokens under escrow. Some have also pointed to the current cryptocurrency landscape in Japan (where Ripple holds a strong community presence and has made several bank partnerships), and how the new regulatory stance of the country can be supporting a new wave of misinformed investors. In a recent blog post, Co-Founder of IndieSquare and Community Director at the Counterparty Foundation, Koji Higashi stated: Another thing to note about this new trend is that the general lack of understanding or appreciation of the technology by many of new users. This is no surprise and all of us have been there at one point but the new wave of Japanese investors seem to be exhibiting a whole new level of incomprehension and misguided decision making in my opinion. However, it is becoming evident that the general lack of knowledge regarding what Ripple is and what the recent updates actually mean is global as XRP has been dominating trading volume in the BTC market as well. Fueled by Misinformation? Although Ripple been one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap for quite some time, its recent rally can only be fueled by the recent rumors and news regarding the XRP token. The most relevant of which are the customers and partnerships acquired by Ripple and today’s announcement regarding Ripple’s 55 Billion coins being locked, which has been circulating the web as a rumor for a while now. Given the scenario, many investors that are now joining the Ripple boat must have no idea what they are buying and how the news actually influences the demand and supply for the token in the long-term, once the “ hype ” has died down. For example, many users believe that banks and other types of financial service providers that are joining the Ripple network should create demand for the XRP token, which is needed in order for banks to make use of the technology that Ripple has created, one that rivals VISA itself in terms of transaction throughput. However, the general public doesn’t seem to realize that these institutions are “encouraged” but not required to use XRP to pay any kind of operation fees. Instead, they can simply make use of the technology provided by Ripple and build their own network using their own in-house tokens. It is also a known fact that Ripple holds ~62% of the XRP supply, which is capped at 100 billion. This means that Ripple currently has roughly $23 Billion worth of XRP. Standards on how marketcap is measured in the cryptocurrency space vary but if you count all of the XRP that currently exists, Ripple has a ~37 billion dollar market cap, or over 7 billion dollars more than Bitcoin. Another general misunderstanding is that the token-lock result in scarcity of XRP tokens. According to the announcement, Ripple will lock 55 billion tokens out of the 62 billion tokens they own as a means to inspire trust (or perhaps to further accelerate the price growth of XRP). The truth is that this will affect the supply of XRP. The tokens that have been in the possession of XRP will continue to be held by the team. In other words, no XRP will be removed from circulation. The number of XRP available on exchanges and wallets today, will remain unchanged. Unfortunately, some less-informed users believe this will create some sort of artificial scarcity. One should also note that Ripple’s pledge to lock any amount of tokens is nothing but fireworks, given that the centralized nature of Ripple allows it to change the rules at any time. A post by Ripple that seeks to compare the characteristics of Bitcoin, Ether, and Ripple makes this clear: In contrast, the Ripple Consensus Ledger has proven governance with institutional validators run by MIT, Microsoft and leading global banks. Lastly, user’s should also note that these tokens won’t be locked for long. The official announcement reads: We’ll use escrow to establish 55 contracts of 1 billion XRP each that will expire on the first day of every month from months 0 to 54. As each contract expires, the XRP will become available for Ripple’s use. Crypto End-Game Despite the aforementioned misunderstandings, it should also be noted that Ripple is certainly not vaporware. The Ripple company is building real technology that is being used by real corporations. But traders should keep in mind that whatever Ripple is building, it is building it for the banks and middlemen, not for the people, per se. This, in my opinion, puts it in a whole other category than Bitcoin and many other decentralized cryptocurrencies, whose goals are to eliminate middlemen, decentralize money, and empower the individual. Is the XRP token in a bubble? Or is there something else we are missing? Let us know what you think is driving the rally in the comment section. Images courtesy of CryptoCompare, Ripple, Shutterstock
bitcoinist	ripple-vs-stellar-coin-will-win	Ripple vs Stellar - Which Coin Will Win? - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-04T01:30	Both of these highflyers are taking the crypto community by storm. Which one will fare better in 2018? Who do we believe will outperform the other? Find out. If Ripple is the Goldman Sachs of crypto, Stellar is its antagonist, Robin Hood, with the latter pointing out that the former is hanging onto to nearly 60% of the originally issued Ripple tokens. Which in my ledger implies they can easily manipulate their own market. For reference, 60% is a towering percentage of founder ownership. So Wall Street has found their Crypto God and they are lifting their gaze to the blockchain to pray for more prophets. In contrast, Stellar’s Robin Hood has bequeathed control of their excess supply of tokens to a non-profit called the Stellar Development Foundation which has no stock or profits given to individuals. Moreover, it’s backed by a benefactor, “No one has ever been fired for using IBM’s coin”. Yes, I made some of that up, but Watson ordered me to write it. Comparing the two competing teams, you’re quickly struck by the difference in their governance. Ripple consists of ex-bankers and an advisory board of global financial institutions, while Stellar casts a group of start-up veterans like WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg Y Combinator President Sam Altman. Dig a little deeper, and one also realizes that Ripple is funding its own competitor in Jed McCaleb, Co-Founder of Stellar. McCaleb started out as a co-founder of Ripple but has been banished by its Sheriff and the rest of Rippleham. In a fitting twist of fate, McCabe still receives $20,000 per week from Ripple and a huge lump sum due in 2019. Back to IBM. Big Blue seems intent on reclaiming its most popular tech darling in the world status by jumping into the Blockchain with both feet. They have assumed the role of Little John to the crypto community and Stellar is one of their strategic investments. They want to be the fifth horseman to Scott Galloway’s Four in Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. IBM views the blockchain as the chance to return to the winner’s stable. So, if Ripple and Stellar are destined to battle it out, how shall we doth compare thee? I will show ye. Ripple (XRP) Stellar Lumens (STR) Market Cap $84 billion $5.9 billion Price $2.17 $0.33 Trading Volume 7.8 billion 518 million Total Coins 100 billion 103 billion Target Market Financial Institutions Companies & Individuals Governance Centralized Decentralized Transaction clearance 2- 4 seconds 2 – 4 seconds Team Bankers Entrepreneurs Major Partner Bank of America, Merrill Lynch IBM Inflation Static/deflationary 1% inflation each year Both Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (STR) have had huge run-ups in the past 30 days and in terms of cryptocurrency market cap rankings, they have reached 2 nd and 5 th respectively. As you can see below, they have been following a similar path over the past 30 days. Ripple or Stellar? The first thing you need to know about both coins is that they’re going to be everywhere. The world’s most powerful banks and one of the most powerful companies are going to be relentlessly shooting their crypto arrows into anything that whiffs of money. And the market for cross-border payments, microtransactions, and intermediary currency functionality is huge and both companies are tackling it with superior technology. For example, if someone is looking to trade U.S. dollars for Euros, either network could facilitate the conversion by matching relevant offers and using Ripple or Lumens to quickly execute the trade. Today it can take hours or days. Neither of these coins will ever see the lofty prices of Bitcoin. There’s too much supply. Imagine Ripple trading at $20,000 which would effectively give it a market cap of two-thousand Apple Computers. That’s not happening. But I will predict that we’ll see Ripple cross $3 a share in 2018 while Lumens will triple. I also predict IBM will leverage blockchain companies like Stellar to leapfrog its competition in an attempt to join the Four Horsemen. Want proof? Just look at the history of IBM and their numerous comeback stories. Think IBM is just out to exploit the blockchain space? Nah, it’s more King Richard than Sheriff Nottingham and it’s a master of reinvention and monetizing trends. This time will be no exception. My conclusion: Ripple will continue its climb, but Stellar is a $15 billion market cap coin trapped in a $5 billion chest. This article is not an investment advice.

bitcoinist	robinhood-targets-millennials-with-free-crypto-trading	Robinhood Targets Millennials with Free Crypto Trading	2018-01-26T12:00	Robinhood, the self-acclaimed fastest-growing online brokerage in history, is getting into cryptocurrencies. It will be offering zero commission crypto trading starting in February. Not quite stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, but opening to crypto trading is certainly a step in the right direction for the US company. Robinhood is a big hit with millennials as it reportedly has 3 million users with a median age of 26. Venturing into crypto will be a huge boon for a generation that is already hungry for Bitcoin and its brethren. Reports indicate that the service will be gradually rolled out during the first half of the year. Zero Fees Unlike other cryptocurrency exchanges, trading on Robinhood will be commission free. As of yesterday, users can set up alerts on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, NEO and 11 other altcoins to track and monitor prices. Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev said: We’re planning to operate this business on a break-even basis and we don’t plan to profit from it for the foreseeable future. The value of Robinhood Crypto is in growing our customer base and better serving our existing customers. This is completely the opposite stance of crypto exchanges like Coinbase which raked in over a billion dollars last year largely from the extortionate fees and commissions it charges its customers. By running the crypto side of the business as a loss leader Robinhood could rapidly expand its customer base. The service will be available in states where it has acquired regulatory approval and there will be no minimum purchase amount. Baiju Bhatt, co-founder and chief executive officer of Robinhood said; Bitcoin has a resiliency to it. This is something that we also feel like really fundamentally aligns with the mission of the company – to make the financial system more accessible to the rest of us. Partners for Purchasing He added that the company would partner with a number of large institutions to acquire virtual currencies but declined to elaborate on who they were. The purchasing power that the $1.3 billion valuation company has will enable it to obtain crypto at a discount. Trading fees are likely to be incorporated into this and not passed onto the customers. Early demand for crypto trading was clear. Over 100,000 Robinhood users were using its app to search for crypto prices and 95% of those surveyed said they would invest in digital currencies. According to reports Robinhood even sent a cease-and-desist to “Cobinhood”, a competing crypto trading app that copied its name and raised $10 million in an ICO. In a country with limited financial freedom and heavy-handed regulators and tax departments, the move is a bold one. Would you use Robinhood instead of a regular exchange to trade crypto?

bitcoinist	roxcoin-will-promises-be-kept	RoxCoin: Will promises be kept? - Bitcoinist.com	2014-07-03T03:59	Roxcoin was released just a few days ago, and it was a ninja launch. Therefore, not much hashpower was directed to it in a short period of time. The ninja launch lasted 24 hours due to a incredibly fast PoW phase which only lasted a day. RoxCoin runs on the X11 algorithm with a total of 4.5 million mined during the PoW phase. Now, what seperates this coin from the usual mediocre stock? They claim its a coin made for musicians, or simply music lovers in that sense. It also claims to bring features that will make music easier to access. Personally, I find the idea to be quite intriguing to say the least. There is no doubt in my mind that there are many music lovers all around the world, but whether they would use a cryptocurrency related to it, we would have to see. An idea I would like to see would be a music marketplace by independent artists. This way, not only is their music spread among cryptocurrency fans, the artists themselves receive recognition for the work they have done. Anywho, that is an idea I would like to see implemented, but the ones that they have said they are working on are different. Anonymity Anonymity has become almost overused lately. All cryptocurrencies that are being released include some sort of implementation of anonymity. RoxCoin claims that TOR integration is already completed, and that beta testing is already in place. The best idea for anonymity in my eyes is TOR integration. The reason for this is that when compared to mixers. it truly is no competition. The TOR network is used by thousands of people, and is recognized as working, and effective which brings even more attention to its use in cryptocurrency. This way, we can achieve true anonymity. From the announcement thread, the developers state that they consider anonymity to be a necessity which I find to be true as well. To achieve decentralization in its totality, we have to be free from the shackles of our governments. An example I find interesting is the Silk Road incident. Had we had true anonymity in bitcoin such as the use of the TOR network, and the use of mixers as well, maybe the bitcoin would not have been confiscated. Yet, this proves that we are in dire need of a replacement to bitcoin. One that is faster, and more anonymous than ever. MultiSig The main use of MultiSig is arguably to increase the difficulty for people to steal coins. Therefore, we can say that a main use of MultiSig is consumer protection which happens to be crucial to a coin’s success. Decentralization is not achieved truly if a government can track down transactions I have executed. RoxCoin claims that it will be crucial when musicians use ROX as a medium to execute their sales transactions. It will allow them to choose a third party arbitrage of their choice to be in charge of an escrow system of payment which will decrease the ability to malpractice. RoxBeat No real information has been released concerning RoxBeat other than the fact that the ROX team wants to merge cryptocurrency and music in a way never seen before. This should be a very interesting idea to keep an eye on. Personally, I hope its somewhat of a marketplace to buy music through ROX. All is speculation though, we will have to keep our eyes on the announcement thread for more information regarding this. Two features that have also been mentioned, but we find close to no information about are RoxJamz, and Proof of Beat. These are very appealing, but the one that sounds most appealing is Proof of Beat. Are we going to see a new sort of system that will work with music? An interesting one indeed, and definitely intriguing as well. Much is promised by the RoxCoin team. I hope they are able to execute it the way they are advertising it because if they do, a bright future lies ahead not only for RoxCoin, but music lovers as well.

bitcoinist	russia-plans-to-regulate-production-and-control-of-cryptocurrencies	Russia Plans to Regulate Production and Control of Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-28T21:30	A new draft law ha s been presented in Russia which proposes the regulation and production of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Regulating Cryptocurrencies A new law in Russia has been proposed which is aiming to regulate and control the production of cryptocurrencies and digital assets in financial sectors. The newly proposed legal framework would properly define regulatory requirements for cryptocurrencies, ICOs, mining, and trading. The law was also proposed in order to curb or stop illicit and illegal activities that might be contacted with cryptocurrencies. The ministry of finance stated that the new regulations would reduce the risk of fraudulent activity and help create a more stable system for cryptocurrency taxation. It’s also worth to note that with the new law, un-licensed investors will only be able to invest up to 50,000 rubles worth around $889, into ICOs. According to the report, the Russian central bank deemed the new law not strict enough. A Boost for the Russian Economy Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been a big topic for governments and regulators in the last couple of months. In late 2017, the Belarussian government decided to officially legalize cryptocurrencies and make any cryptocurrency related activities tax exempt for the next five years. Analysts believe that more countries worldwide will aim to create laws that favor cryptocurrency businesses in order to attract companies and boost the countries economic activity. Initial Coin Offerings have been on the radar of many regulatory agencies worldwide. The new Russian legal framework would require all entities that wish to conduct an ICO, to fulfill all regulatory requirements. The ministry of finance believes that the new ICO regulations will make it easier for companies to host token sales and comply with the necessary laws. Germany and France have proposed to discuss the regulation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the upcoming G20 summit in Buenos Aires. What are your thoughts on the new cryptocurrency regulations in Russia? Do you think that they are necessary in order to further legitimize cryptocurrencies worldwide?

bitcoinist	russia-preps-draft-law-cryptocurrency-regulation	Russia Preps Draft Law for Cryptocurrency Regulation - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-27T20:30	The train has left the regulation station as Russia prepares to submit their draft law on controlling regulating the country’s booming crypto industry. The wheels continue to turn as Russia moves forward with its plan to regulate cryptocurrencies and ICOs within the country and to provide a definitive framework for trading in the industry. According to EconoTimes, Russia’s Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, had this to say: The Ministry of Finance has prepared a draft law, currently under consideration, which will determine the procedure for issuing, taxing, buying and circulation of cryptocurrency. Crypto Will Not Be Seen as a Currency State-operated news agency RIA Novosti has reported that the draft will be submitted on the 28th of December. Anatoly Aksakov, who is the chairman of the State Duma committee for the financial market, has said, through a rough translation, that cryptocurrencies will be known as “other properties”: There will be a final evaluation before the presentation of the bill. [Whether it is] Bitcoin or Ether, all cryptocurrencies [will be known as] other property. Limited ICO Investing It’s not just digital currencies that will be getting the regulation treatment. The draft law also discusses ICOs. Aksakov added: The approach to how the ICO should be conducted is defined. I repeat, this is not the latest version, the latest version will be discussed in the coming days. The ICO is seen as an element of crowdfunding, and the approach is that investors should be limited in the amount they invest. Sergey Shvetsov, who is the First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, had previously stated that his institution’s goal of regulating ICOs will result in it becoming an alternative means of raising capital in the country. Even though the bill will be reviewed this week, implementation is still a couple of months away. According to Aksakov: I expect that the adoption of the draft law on cryptocurrencies will be in March. D-Day Approaches Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously earmarked July 2018 as the deadline for the implementation of new and comprehensive crypto regulations in the country Aksakov has stressed that the draft law is actually in the interest of crypto holders: The problem is that we already have a lot of people who acquire[d] cryptocurrencies and they are deceived, we need to give people the opportunity to work legally with it, to protect them as much as possible. Even though Russia is aggressively pushing their regulation efforts, they are not immune to the charms of virtual currencies, previously announcing that they too will be part of the crypto revolution by launching their own digital currency, the CryptoRuble.

bitcoinist	russia-set-vote-legalizing-cryptocurrency	Russia Set to Vote on Legalizing Cryptocurrency - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-15T02:00	With regulation coming thick and fast across Asia the effects on the markets can be seen instantly. Last week a bucket-load of FUD caused a sell-off when a number of large news agencies misreported that South Korea was banning crypto trading. This wasn’t the case at all and the country remains open. Russia could soon be joining them as it prepares to vote on legalizing crypto exchanges. According to Newsweek, citing Russian media, the Ministry of Finance has drafted a new bill to legalize cryptocurrency trading on organized trading platforms. It will submit the bill to the federal legislature for voting in February. Official Exchanges Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev told media that the Finance Ministry supports the legalization of trade in cryptocurrencies on official exchanges and does not want to limit and regulate, but will set some limits. He went on to add; This is about the fact that buying and selling of cryptocurrencies will be somehow standardized. The general idea is that it will be necessary to buy and sell on official exchanges, as it will be declared, it will be legalized. Last week Russia’s central bank confirmed that it had discussed the possibility of legalizing crypto trading with the Finance Ministry through organized exchange platforms. While Bank of Russia opposes the move, as most banks do, the policymakers seem to be a little more open to the notion. Warming to Crypto Russia came down heavy on crypto trading last year when the head of Russia’s Ministry of Communications said the country would ‘never’ legalize Bitcoin within its economy. Representatives from the central bank have a called it a pyramid scheme and seem staunchly opposed to a system that would effectively take control away from the bank. President Putin sees the need for regulation and last week told local media; If we regulate, but not efficiently enough, then the government will be responsible for the difficult situations that people can get into. Right now it is the responsibility of the person himself and the government can only say ‘you can do this but you can’t do that,’ and if it’s still not clear then there will be some problems that need to be solved. Similar to the stance in South Korea the Russian government is appearing to want to protect its citizens from making risky financial decisions that could end badly for those with limited knowledge and experience. Will cryptocurrency legalization in Russia bring a surge of new traders to the markets? Add your thoughts below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock
bitcoinist	russian-businessman-buys-power-plants-cryptocurrency-mining	Russian Businessman Buys Power Plants for Cryptocurrency Mining - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-15T14:30	Taking matters into his own hands, a Russian businessman buys two electric power plants for the purposes of cryptocurrency mining. For those who are active participants in cryptocurrency mining, there are a number of issues to be concerned with. One such problem is how a country’s national government feels about cryptocurrency, such as either accepting it or banning it outright. Another major concern is having access to the power needed for mining crypto in the first place. One Russian businessman has decided to take matters into his own hands and has bought two electric power plants expressly for the purpose of crypto mining. Need More Power? Why Not Buy a Power Plant? Russia has been giving China a pretty good run for their money when it comes to mining cryptocurrency. One such reason is the cheap power to be found in the country, and it was not too long ago that some Russian power companies decided to begin selling off their excess power to Bitcoin miners at a substantial savings. Of course, a miner is always at the whim of government regulations and power companies providing a steady source of electrical juice to keep the mining servers going. A Russian businessman, Aleksey Kolesnik, decided to ensure a steady supply of power by purchasing two electrical power plants in the Perm Region, which is located on the western side of the Middle Ural Mountains. Kolesnik says that the power plants will be turned into a data center and a center for cryptocurrency mining. The cost for the two plants is just over $2.8 million (or 160 million rubles). Kolesnik says that mining will only be possible if Russia passes the right legislation and approves the use of virtual currencies. To Allow Crypto or Not? By happy chance, Russia is poised to pass legislation that will legalize crypto trading on organized trading platforms. Russia has danced back and forth over cryptocurrency over the last few years, but it now solidly appears that the country will allow it, albeit with some regulations put into place. Russia’s actions are a far cry from what China is now doing. Cryptocurrency mining in China is coming to a screeching halt. The People’s Bank of China is making sure that local regulators are restricting the use of power by crypto miners. In fact, the Chinese government is asking local governments to help guide crypto miners out of the business entirely. This has led to a mass exodus of miners as they seek out greener pastures in places such as Singapore, Japan, and even Canada. It is interesting to see crypto miners taking fate into their own hands by outright buying power plants to keep their operations going. Perhaps this may be a portent of things to come. Do you think it’s a wise decision to buy your own power plant for cryptocurrency mining? Will other miners, if they are able, follow suit? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

bitcoinist	sec-cyber-team-shuts-fraudulent-ico	SEC Cyber Team Shuts Down Fraudulent ICO - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-05T12:30	Initial coin offerings have become one of the most popular and easy ways to raise money online through cryptocurrencies. But ICOs have also become a popular way for fraudsters to scam people as the SEC recently showed by filing suit against the ICO by PlexCorps. ICO: A Threat to Venture Capital Firms? Early stage startup funding has been steadily declining over the last couple of months. The main reason behind this is the rapid rise of initial coin offerings. Nowadays, many startups prefer to host their own token sales instead of seeking funding from an incubator, accelerator, or venture funding firm. One of the major advantages that a token sale has compared to traditional VC funding is that startups are not forced to give up equity in exchange for funding. According to the cryptocurrency statistics website Coinschedule, a grand total of 234 projects have raised over $3.6 billion through initial coin offerings in 2017. Many experts believe that the ICO market is going to further grow in the upcoming years, due to the fact that more and more startups realize that it’s a better way to raise money than traditional VC funding. The New Opportunity for Scammers Most of the projects and startups that conduct an ICO have a solid product, team, and reputation. But there is still a tiny minority of ICO projects that may actually be fraudulent. In a recent article by the Internation Business Times, it was reported that the US cyber unit has filed its first charges against a project to stop its token sale. The cyber unit was recently founded by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in order to closely monitor the ICO and cryptocurrency market for potential scams and frauds. The cyber unit sprang into action against PlexCorps and its founder, Dominic Lacroix. In the ICO offered by PlexCorps, investors were told that they could see a return of over 1000% within just 30 days. If that wasn’t enough of a red flag, PlexCorps would not list its team of “world class experts” due to the fact that PlexCorps didn’t want other companies to poach them. Lacroix even kept his own identity hidden during the ICO, which was done for a very good reason. It turns out that he’s a known recidivist securities law violator in Canada, and the SEC maintains that the vaunted team is just Lacroix and a small group of employees in Quebec. Lacroix and his partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer, did raise over $15 million, but it appears that the money went into their pockets and was spent on personal expenses and home decor projects. Robert Cohen, Chief of the SEC’s Cyber Unit, stated the following about the PlexCorps situation: This first Cyber Unit case hits all of the characteristics of a full-fledged cyber scam and is exactly the kind of misconduct the unit will be pursuing. He also added: We acted quickly to protect retail investors from this initial coin offering’s false promises. The cyber unit has successfully prevented a fraudulent ICO from taking place, but many government regulators are still warning investors from participating in such investment schemes without verifying if the projects comply with the proper regulations and having the ICO details fully vetted. What are your thoughts on fraudulent ICOs? Do you think that fewer scammers will try to conduct fraudulent ICOs in the future? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay.
bitcoinist	sign-brazil-harnessing-ethereum-blockchain-political-expression	Sign Here! Brazil Harnessing Ethereum Blockchain for Political Expression - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-07T08:00	Popular petitions are an important part of the political process in Brazil, but current methodology makes them almost impossible to use. Now the country is turning to the Ethereum blockchain for a solution. In many political systems, the voice of the people is often not heard. To combat such a situation, Brazil has an intriguing mechanism embedded within its constitution: popular petitions. Successful popular petitions must be heard within the country’s legislature, but there are some significant hurdles lying in wait for activists who wish to use them. However, Brazil is turning to the power of the Ethereum blockchain to make signing and verifying popular petitions so much easier. Complicated Politics To say that Brazil has a complicated electoral system is putting it mildly. The Economist even refers to the country’s politics as “sleazy.” There are several dozen political parties and thousands of candidates for voters to choose from. Yet cutting through the chaff is the popular petition that allows citizens a direct means to make their government listen to them. If a petition garners signatures from at least 1% of the electorate, then the petition must be heard in the country’s congress. This is easier said that done as Brazil boasts a population of 207 million people, with 145 million people on the electoral rolls. Law professor Henrique Araújo Costa notes that Brazil hasn’t been fulfilling this constitutional requirement because: In part this is due to the absence of a platform that can securely collect the signatures of one percent of voters. We’ve been through a sort of crisis regarding the legitimacy…of our laws. Blockchain to the Rescue The problem of popular petitions is twofold. The first is gathering the signatures in the first place as the country is the size of the entire European Union. The second is that verifying the signatures is essentially impossible. This means that very few petitions have become law – in fact, only four have done so. This lack of success has been a major sore spot with Brazilians as the petitions give them a voice and force politicians to actually tackle subjects that they would prefer not to. Costa notes: Popular [petitions] always arise on very sensitive themes. If we do not overcome this security issue regarding the collection of signatures, we will still be further from achieving the exercise of citizenship that our Congress promised decades ago. However, the Ethereum blockchain can serve as an ideal solution to the problems associated with popular petitions. The blockchain will allow people to instantly verify that their signature is attached to a specific petition. The setup being created is a cell phone app that Brazilians can use to register their details with. They can use the app to create a petition, sign a petition, and to keep track of how many people have attached their name to a particular petition. As the names are put through hashing and become part of the Ethereum blockchain, there’s no way for someone to alter the data. Privacy is fully protected as a person can verify that they signed a petition, but they cannot see who else has signed it through the app. The result is cryptographic proof that a person’s signature is embedded within the petition’s hash. Overall, this is a tremendous use for blockchain technology. Allowing people to create and sign petitions using an app hugely reduces the cost in both time and money for gathering signatures. The only downside is that the ease of use could lead to some frivolous petitions being launched, but whoever said democracy was easy? What do you think about Brazil turning to the Ethereum blockchain to handle popular petitions? Should other countries follow suit? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	singapore-wont-part-state-controlled-crypto-movement	Singapore Won't Be Part of the State-controlled Crypto Movement - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-12T21:00	Even though many countries are interested in, and indeed are pursuing, the creation of national state-run virtual currencies, Singapore isn’t one of them. The digital currency revolution is here, and it’s not just reserved for Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies. More and more countries are exploring the benefits of having a cashless society. Sweden has previously voiced their desire to investigate the development of an e-krona, Israel is looking into creating a digital shekel, while Russia could soon develop their CryptoRuble. Venezuela also seems to be well on its way to issuing their Petro, even though the legality thereof is up for discussion. Axel Weber, who is the chairman of Switzerland’s UBS, previously said that central banks and other financial authorities should seriously consider going this route. Singapore Not Jumping on Board the Digital Train However, the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Ravi Menon, is not convinced that getting rid of traditional fiat money is the way to go. According to the Financial Times, he had this to say on the matter: Why would the central bank want to do that? If there’s any sense of nervousness about the banks, you will have a bank run; everybody is going to go into the central bank [with their deposits], and, if people placed their deposits with central banks, who’s going to extend credit? He added: “In practical terms, I think, that’s a long way off, one of the last things you’d want to think about doing.” Even though MAS hopes to market Singapore as a haven for innovators hoping to improve the economic sector, stability is always at the forefront of the authority’s mind. Menon explained: “That’s been our basic modus operandi, to be both a regulator and a promoter. Our governing mandate, is very clear: financial stability has predominance over financial development.” Singapore to Extend Regulatory Mandate Regarding Cryptocurrencies: The Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore has sought to clarify the nation’s stance on cryptocurrencies with regards to its money laun #crypto #currency https://t.co/7PAoBObckh pic.twitter.com/rKIaJPOVaP — The Currency Scene (@CurrenScene) January 12, 2018 MAS Has Their Eye on Bitcoin However, MAS is not opposed to cryptocurrencies. They are hoping to use virtual currencies for interbank transfers, and may even make use of ICOs for certain fundraising efforts. Even so, the authority is monitoring Bitcoin’s swinging price pendulum. The currency reached records heights of nearly $20k last month and, at the time of writing, is now trading at just under $14k according to CoinMarketCap. Menon referred to the b-word to describe his concern. He said a crash might “potentially cast a larger shadow over fintech, over innovation. That’s a problem with bubbles, it’s too much and it undermines confidence.” According to him, people who may lose out on this supposed bubble burst shouldn’t expect any help from the MAS: Why would you want to bail out people from their folly? These [cryptocurrencies] are issued by private agents; I think the role of the government is to warn people, which several of us have done. Luring Business, but Not at the Expense of Regulations According to Boston Consulting Group, Singapore manages about $1.2 trillion worth of offshore money. Even though the country is keen to get more Asian banks trading on their soil, Menon does not plan to offer slack regulations to lure them there: We don’t want to have the kind of reputation some offshore havens have. I think, in our actions the last couple of years, we’ve shown that this is a very strong law-and-order kind of place and keeping the system clean is really up there alongside keeping the system stable. Menon has previously said that the country has no plans to regulate the crypto trade. Do you think that national state-run virtual currencies will be the norm in the years to come?

bitcoinist	six-ethereum-projects-and-its-five-competitors	Six Ethereum Projects and its Five Competitors - Bitcoinist.com	2016-02-03T08:00	A lot of 2.0 projects have fallen by the wayside, but currently, Ethereum (ETH) development has continued to show its decentralized blockchain platform wants to stick around for the long run. Startups, legacy institutions, and developers using the programmable currency are popping up left and right. Below is a list of six projects using the ETH blockchain to try and conquer many different 2.0 tasks. Then we discuss a few competitors in the crypto-environment going after some the same goals. As time progresses in this world of decentralized distributed ledgers, the race for 2.0 technology continues. Also Read: Crawling The Deep Web For Art IBM & Samsung’s Adept In January of 2015, IBM revealed its ADEPT proof of concept in a paper called “Device Democracy Saving the future of the Internet of Things.” The report explains the importance of the blockchain and its use case scenarios within the IoT environment becoming “revolutionary as a transaction processing tool.” ADEPT has chosen to use a fork of the Ethereum code for its mission and the use of autonomous telemetry. IBM’s paper describes how they envision the project saying, “In our vision of a decentralized IoT, the blockchain is the framework facilitating transaction processing and coordination among interacting devices. Each manages its own roles and behavior, resulting in an “Internet of Decentralized, Autonomous Things” – and thus the democratization of the digital world.” Airlock Project The Ethereum powered Airlock is called “the next generation keyless protocol.” The platform uses two primary users lockmasters and keyholders which can lock or unlock a lockbox mechanism. Airlock states on its website, “ Lockmasters seamlessly grant permission to Keyholders who can access a property or lockbox under specified conditions.” The advantage of using Ethereum’s smart contracts allows Airlock’s DApp (Decentralized Application) to create a programmable environment that can operate device automation the developers say. Microsoft Azure Last year Microsoft announced its new cloud-based Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform Azure. The company has announced many different types of distributed ledgers within the projects research and development. Blockchains such as Ripple, Factom, and Emercoin have been introduced to the system, but the media has focused its attention on Ethereum. Just recently R3 CEV told the world it was using the Ethereum protocol through Azure to connect 11 banks together for a Bank-to-Bank (B2B) platform. The Microsoft cloud platform has also revealed its first Technical Preview of Azure Stack, which shows the public the projects manifestation. Algorythmix Algorythmix is a blockchain based credit rating and KYC platform that just won the first prize in the Citi Mobile Challenge. The platform “Cetas” is a decentralized prototype that uses blockchain technology to bifurcate the traditional way credit ratings are handled. Algorythmix gave a statement to IBTimes UK saying, “Cetas is a decentralized platform which enables sharing of the KYC data using blockchain. The platform has an added a layer of decentralized credit rating function and advanced functionalities to address the problem of scale.” The blockchain service also has other projects which have not been conceived yet. One is Basil that can calculate cyber security risk for cyber insurance, and Hermes a platform for sensor networks for industrial IoT application. CubeSpawn CubeSpawn is an FMS (flexible manufacturing system) that enables big factory automation. The website states the initiative is an “open source project to build cost sensitive, high quality, modular manufacturing machines, mostly from repurposed industrial cast-offs.” The project wants to bring technical advances to everyone so the world can best allocate its resources. It believes “local high-tech manufacturing” is the answer to many global issues the world is faced with. The positives the projects could produce include reduction in long distance shipping, reducing fuel costs, encourage recycling, and ending labor inequalities. Augur Augur is a prediction market built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The concept is a tool that allows users to forecast events by using software that understands the odds of basically any probability better than you do. This could make betting on sports games, elections, and future events easier because the protocol is meant to be more consistent. Augur uses a token within its system called REP (reputation) that gives a user more trust in the network. After an event occurs those who use the system more truthfully get rewarded REP. The startup just recently finished a crowd sale and also created the first contract on Ethereums Frontier. What’s Next in the 2.0 Race? The Ethereum project is seeing a lot of developers messing around with the code and people are finding use cases. Despite all this the programmable currency has competition in its radar with organizations who also want to achieve the same goals. Maidsafe, Tau Chain, and Counterparty are other projects that aim to do some similar objectives that Ethereum wants to encompass. In November of 2014, Counterparty sparked controversy by porting the ETH software to its platform. The project says that it uses Bitcoin’s ledger within its network stating on its website, “Counterparty is a free and open platform that puts powerful financial tools in the hands of everyone with an Internet connection. By harnessing the power of the Bitcoin network, Counterparty creates a robust and secure marketplace directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.” Another contender or friend is Rootstock. The platform uses Bitcoin’s blockchain as opposed to an alternative token. Rootstock is said to have the same abilities as Ethereum, and its developer says that they could compliment each other. Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar co-founder of Rootstock says in a reddit post : “ The good thing is Rootstock VM is fully compatible with Ethereum VM so now you will have two platforms to run your application with two different security models and user bases. We are actually empowering the Ethereum development community not threatening it.” Tau Chain is another project that claims it also will be able to take the 2.0 game to the next level. The developers of Tau believes that Ethereum’s Turing completeness is not necessarily the right direction. Ohad Asor of the Tau teams also says that its platform doesn’t need a token like ETH to operate saying, “ Ethereum’s model requires a coin (“fuel”). Tau doesn’t need a coin: the users can agree on the economic characteristic of the network and define any kind of incentive they find adequate, whether globally over the whole network or over their local Tau client.” Maidsafe is a project that has been said it could be a friend of foe to ETH as well. The project aims to be a decentralized peer-to-peer internet platform and has similar attributes to Ethereum. Some say that Maidsafe can be considered a decentralized storage layer with a multitude of applications. Maidsafe, stands for “Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone” and wants to change the landscape of the web with its 2.0 platform. Ethereum does have its competitors and developers are gearing up their platforms to operate with similar goals in mind. Most of these different networks have been in the top ten cryptocurrency market capitalization at one time or another and are shooting to be right below Bitcoin. There are other projects that do not have as much attention on them right now like Hivemind, which also works with prediction markets like the Augur platform. The project says it is “a Peer-to-Peer Oracle Protocol which absorbs accurate data into a blockchain” and also will incorporate similar 2.0 features to its system. The Ethereum project is definitely not alone in this landscape of smart contract technology, and highly developed blockchains as we’ve seen in the past it will have to continue strides of its own to gain a network effect. What do you think about these Ethereum projects and the turing complete protocols competitors? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	social-networks-decentralization-synereo-case	Social Networks and Decentralization: the Synereo Case	2015-02-25T08:00	The advent of crypto currencies and its inherent technologies have brought us a new and long string of innovation along with a newborn industry teaming with activity and replenishing of new business opportunities. Crypto currencies and decentralization as its core fabric have enabled the use of sensitive applications with the sole purpose of stretching the boundaries of communication channels thus allowing freedom of speech. On an internet controlled by ISP’s, bombed by a growing and constant surveillance, the concept of privacy is increasingly being taken out and turned into an obsolete feature soon to be lost in social networks. Every day we see people posting their entire lives at social networks, either it is Facebook or it is Twitter or Google plus. People are becoming addicted to these social communities, granting them access to their most intimate secrets and private information. What is freedom of speech all about? Social behavior plays a significant part in the social acceptance and can sometimes seem restrictive and limiting in the real world. Internet-based social networks and social media groups enable people to have a certain sense of freedom to express like they wouldn’t in real life. Online communities promote freedom of speech in their fashion, and people tend to have a different behavior in these virtual worlds – a type of behavior that they wouldn’t adopt in everyday life. Most users of these conventional social networks don’t even know what’s being made with their profiles and the way their private information is being treated. For the companies behind Social Networks, users are simply a target and a product of advertisement, mere numbers of a wider game, from which they avidly take enormous profits. By constantly monitoring user’s profiles, and their private information, they perform some surveillance over the user’s web character and indiscriminately collect data to use it for unknown purposes. Why do Social Networks matter? There’s little doubt that social networks already play a big role in everyday life and in the way how companies use them and how they can be used by governments as the ultimate social control tool. However, they are also one of the most important tools enabling freedom of speech that we all should be protecting. In this new “global village” all voices should be heard and the community should be the one making the decisions. Not some central authority or an arbitrary position from a lobby or interest group. Besides this, how can we ensure that we are being heard and more importantly what is our private information being used for. Social Networks have the potential to spread new ideas to report new concepts and most of all, to spread knowledge and information that needs to be absolutely free of control and censorship. Can we trust Social Networks? Currently, the Internet serves as a unique tool for freedom of expression. Anyone can contribute. Social Networks have enhanced even further this particular feature of the internet, but it is also safe to consider that Social networks are still in its infancy, still being developed gradually. Social Networks are monitoring and managing all content that users share. This content can be removed or subjected to scrutiny. Social networks have currently adopted a method where users are not the client, but simply the product constantly being sold. The value created by users is being controlled, reaching only a select few and who gets to decide this? Not the users. So the future of Social Networks is set to be founded upon the decentralization concept where the user is in full control and the value he creates stays under his control. Now, new projects are aiming to go over a new planning to restructure the concept of social networks. With decentralization as main tool, these projects are determined to initiate a new revolution in social networks. Decentralization Decentralization can occur at many levels and with many different characteristics. It’s commonly regarded has the transfer of authority and responsibility of public functions from a central organization. This can happen in the public or private sector and provides a greater transparency and less vulnerability to censorship. Freedom of speech and free expression is in its real sense Decentralization. Freedom of speech is more important now than ever. The intervention of the State and Law is widely expanding. The access to free speech and free expression allows the dynamics of so-called Democratic Societies through the manifestation of individuality in public space dominance. However, what we see today is a control imposition from the Society against the individual. Currently, with Social networks having a crucial part in offering people the opportunity to express themselves at will and to totally achieve the real concept of free speech it is becoming increasingly important to apply decentralization to such platforms. To do this, we need to deliver a place where people can meet far from the dictating eyes of censorship or at least totally free from it. This is where decentralization comes into play. The Synereo Case Today we are seeing an increasing number of developments being made with the intention to design new ideas and new concepts in order to present the perfect solution for the future of Social Networks. One of these proposals is an open source project called Synereo. Synereo is one those projects trying to introduce something significantly new while placing itself in the vanguard of a new generation of social networks. Their main approach is: Power to the User. Synereo introduces a set of key features taken from the bitcoin protocol to implement a fully self-maintained and auto moderated social network that enables a completely decentralized environment. This environment maintains its neutrality by using and introducing three main elements: Decentralization, Compensation, and Reputation. Synereo vision is to improve the model already presented by other social networks, but instead of being managed and regulated by a central authority, it uses blockchain technology to ensure a decentralized level of security and privacy fit for the next generation of social networking. Having this as the main approach, Synereo may well be the Facebook killer. This new social network was designed to give people the alternative of having a single resource-rich entity that manages and controls the information they share throughout social network. Synereo will introduce AMPs as its own currency in order to promote and compensate users sharing information through the network: AMPs, will be the Synereo’s content flow currency – a Token, whose main purpose is to amplify the flow of information through the network. AMPing content increases its ability to propagate to peers and the chances of it being seen by more users. This is what gives AMPs its intrinsic value, because if someone wishing to advertise to the user’s attention will have to pay the user with Synereo’s Currency for it. Synereo was developed with the right technology to run a distributed social network where users may contribute in many aspects and in turn receive the rightful compensation. The platform will also provide its users and communities the ability to choose how to govern themselves and organize according to their principles and values. Synereo will have no center of control and will be totally free from its operator’s financial desires. Because it’s designed to value attention through direct compensation it will reward content creators while being as private and as unmonitored as the demand seems to be. With these directives, Synereo’s development team believes to have built a better system for social organization online. Its organic design and decentralized features make it a secure network almost impossible to take down. Synereo is trying to disrupt what the average type of social networks looks like. By launching a new social networking architecture and allowing communities and users to be right owners of their information, Synereo will surely change what the social networking landscape looks like today.

bitcoinist	south-korea-fines-exchanges-violations	South Korea Fines 6 Exchanges For Security Law 'Violations'	2018-01-24T08:30	Six major South Korea cryptocurrency exchanges have received fines of around 25 million won ($23,500) for lax security measures which “violated” laws. 6 Of 10 Exchanges Ordered To Pay As local news media outlet Yonhap News Agency reports Wednesday, government officials will press forward with penalties in what some commentators view as an increasingly promising sign of bringing the domestic cryptocurrency industry under regulatory control. “Although the size of transactions and the number of users are surging, overall user protection measures are insufficient,” the publication quotes the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) as saying. The decision to fine exchanges flouting the Information and Communications Act, which include well-known names such as Korbit, Coinone and Coinplug, follows a joint investigation into security setups at ten exchanges which several government agencies ran from October to December last year. ‘Tiny’ Fines The move is the latest is Seoul’s ongoing bid to solidify the exchange market, having confirmed this week that anonymous trading would end January 30 and exchanges must pay tax on 2017 profits in full by April 30. Reactions have been mixed, with native exchange users in particular sensitive following mass uproar resulting from the government’s handling of the issue over the past months. Consensus appears to be similarly lacking on the fines, a KCC source telling Yonhap the amounts involved are “too low” and industry figures likewise voicing suspicions. Those fines are tiny. Looks like they want to keep the geese with the golden eggs alive. https://t.co/6h3R3qjTW9 — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) January 24, 2018 “I know there is an indication that the amount imposed on each operator is too low, but this measure imposes the maximum amount possible under current information and communication network law,” the official stated. Nonetheless, security problems at Korean exchanges have received significant negative press amid rumors North Korea was stealing funds for its own ends on a regular basis. Amid the suspicion, one media company hired white hat hackers to create and then compromise accounts on five exchanges, which it reports was successfully done with what it describes as “basic” tools.

bitcoinist	south-korea-legalizes-bitcoin-ban-anon	South Korea 'Legalizes' Cryptocurrency Trading, Bans Anonymity	2018-01-23T08:30	South Korea lawmakers have confirmed cryptocurrency exchanges will become de facto legal January 30 as they enact new laws about anonymity in trading. 6 Banks On Board For Change In its most recent statements, the country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) confirmed that exchanges must only permit trades from customers whose name matches their bank account. Foreign citizens, both native and non-native, will not be allowed to trade. “Establishment of the system for ‘real name verification of deposit and withdrawal accounts’ for settlement will be completed by January 30, 2018,” the FSC documentation reads.* So far, six of Korea’s major banks have signed up to implement the required monitoring changes following collaboration with the government on inspection of anonymous exchange trading accounts earlier this month. These are Shinhan Bank, Nonghyup Bank, Industrial Bank, Kookmin Bank, Hana Bank and Gwangju Bank. Exchanges Prepare In Advance In reactions to the setting in stone of the new way of trading cryptocurrency, major exchanges presented various requirements for users. Korbit, one of the leading platforms along with Bithumb, told customers to open an account at Shinhan specifically in order to continue trading. “To use the new KRW deposit method, which is slated to be implemented within this month, you must have a Shinhan Bank account registered under your legal name. Please use this time to create a banking account at Shinhan Bank,” a post states. Foreign-based customers had been able to gain access to the Korean market through virtual bank accounts and other tools, but they, along with minors, now face a moratorium of undetermined length. On Monday, Seoul also addressed the issue of taxation on cryptocurrency exchanges, which are now obliged to pay a corporation tax and local income tax for 2017 profits amounting to 24.2%. Markets continued to fall slightly through Tuesday, with the cementing of Korea’s official regulatory position on crypto trading having little effect on overall flat sentiment. *This quotation is extracted from the first PDF file available in attachments via the source link.

bitcoinist	south-korea-mulls-crypto-tax	South Korea Mulls Crypto Tax - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-13T24:00	With reports claiming that Asian traders are responsible for the bulk of the upward price action in Bitcoin and altcoins, it comes as no surprise that their governments want to gain some control of the runaway markets. With South Korea reportedly accountable for over a quarter of the global trade in crypto currency, its government is considering taxing cryptocurrencies. The average citizen can partake in this feverish market, and South Koreans are taking to cryptocurrencies in droves. Governments are naturally cautious entities, especially those in Asia which tend to be more autocratic than their western counterparts. According to a Reuters report, the South Korea government said on Wednesday that it may tax capital gains from cryptocurrency trading as concern from global regulators about a bubble escalated. Warning from Down Under Australia’s central bank chief also issued a warning of a “speculative mania” that has caused prices to skyrocket over the past month. A further step towards virtual currency mainstream acceptance was made when US exchange CBOE launched their Bitcoin futures contracts on Sunday, with CME to follow this weekend. Policy makers have been forced to pay attention to cryptocurrencies now that they are gaining more momentum. An emergency meeting today in Seoul concluded with the government stating that it will consider taxing capital gains from the trading of virtual coins and will also ban minors from opening accounts on exchanges. According to Reuters, the head of marketing at Hong Kong-based exchange Gatecoin, Thomas Glucksmann, stated: The regulations in Korea will not have a negative effect, licensing brings certainty, which encourages already regulated entities … to get involved in addition to skeptical retail investors. South Korean crypto exchange giant Bithumb stated that it would be fully compliant with any potential regulation from the government and adequately capitalize itself to protect its clients. Earlier this week, the finance minister said that ministries are in talks to decide whether such trading should be regulated. The chief of the financial regulator said some Justice Ministry officials are calling for an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading, though no official decision has been made. Crypto Prices Stable Bitcoin-related shares in Seoul tumbled in early trade on news of the government’s emergency meeting, but they soon rebounded as the statement did not confirm any prohibitions. Bitcoin itself has been trading sideways for a couple of days and currently sits just below $17,000, according to Coinmarketcap. Litecoin, a favorite in Korea, reached an all-time high yesterday, and Ethereum and Ripple are currently trading at their highest levels. Any speculation of South Korean regulation has yet to affect crypto market prices. Will a Korean clampdown affect global crypto markets? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

bitcoinist	south-korea-wont-ban-bitcoin-trading	South Korea Tightens Grip, But Won't Ban Bitcoin Trading - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-28T03:00	It was only a matter of time until authorities pulled the reins in on one of the biggest crypto trading nations in the world. South Korea, which is responsible for as much as 25% of total crypto trading volume, said on Thursday it will impose additional measures to regulate speculation in crypto within the country. South Korea Will Ban Anonymous Crypto Trading As previously reported that more regulations are expected, South Korean regulators have confirmed additional measures to curb illegal activities at cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Reuters, the government noted that trading prices of most digital currencies were much higher on South Korean exchanges than they were on exchanges in other countries. A government spokesperson made the following statement: The government had warned several times that virtual coins cannot play a role as actual currency and could result in high losses due to excessive volatility. The first steps will include a ban on opening anonymous crypto trading accounts. Most exchanges require photographic proof of identity anyway, so this regulation is nothing to be concerned about. Secondly, however, is a more alarming plan to introduce new legislation which will allow regulators to close virtual coin exchanges if required. This measure had been recommended by the justice ministry, according to the statement. Previously, South Korea had announced a plan to tax capital gains from cryptocurrency trading to tackle what it perceives as the risk of excessive speculation. Banks Backing Off As expected, earlier this week, two major banks in South Korea announced that they are closing reward programs, which allow clients to purchase bitcoins with credit card bonus points. Commercial banks in the country are increasingly preventing the opening of new virtual accounts, which are necessary to trade on South Korean crypto exchanges. In addition to Shinhan Bank and KB Kookmin Bank closing rewards programs next month, Woori Bank and Korea Development Bank also announced that they would be closing all virtual accounts provided to exchanges. It is no surprise that banks in South Korea and elsewhere are pulling back from crypto; the concept essentially goes against their business model. Unfortunately, in this embryonic industry, traders still need to rely on exchanges, many of which, such as Coinbase, have adopted banking-style models of fees and commissions. Only when crypto trading is truly decentralized and peer-to-peer will the masses start to benefit more than the banks and exchanges. Will the Korean clampdown affect the markets?

bitcoinist	spells-genesis-blockchain-based-trading-card-game	Spells of Genesis – A Blockchain Based Trading Card Game - Bitcoinist.com	2015-05-05T08:00	Spells of Genesis is a new mobile game that combines trading cards with an arcade, similar to Magic the Gathering with an epic style role play. The most important aspect of this game: it will use blockchain technology as well as Bitcoin for its game economy and storyline. It will be the first one to do so, making it one of the most innovative and interesting games on the scene. The game allows for players to collect and trade cards, build powerful decks, and defeat their opponents on this epic adventure part of the fantasy realm of Moonga. During the game, players will encounter hundreds of enemies which they have to defeat using a unique battle system. Players have to strategically place their orbs (cards) and shoot them at the enemy. The combination of intuitive gameplay with deep strategy featured in Spells of Genesis is what makes it a hard game to master but easy to learn. Also Read: Two Bitcoin ATMs Installed at Outpost Game Centers in Belgium The Game On this journey, players will need to be constantly collecting and trading orbs to upgrade their deck of cards. To defeat their opponents, players will have to face them in the battlefield using a specially developed combat style. The game takes place in a fantasy world built of mountains, deserts, seas filled with mythical, wicked creatures. In each level, players will encounter enemies with different skills, and they will need to use their cards in order to annihilate them. The cards will have an important role in the game, each Orb is different with its own attributes, strengths, weaknesses, and special powers. Players need to use these features strategically to help them defeat opponents of various abilities throughout the game. Spells of Genesis is being developed by Everdreamsoft, the creators of the successful trading card game Moonga which received so far over 250.000 downloads. Moonga was very popular, it was the top-rated game in several countries between 2010 and 2012. Nowadays games are being produced by developers focusing on profiting from players rather than being interested in rewarding them. Everdreamsoft, instead, wants to create a game based on strong cooperation between community and players. The game maker aims to reward supporters who contribute to the development and promotion of the project with a financial incentive. The intention is to have a game owned by the community not only by its developers. Players will be able to contribute to the development and funding of the project while receiving some profits later. Token System BitCrystals will be the game fuel and the premium in-game currency, they are a Counterparty asset, also known as Token. There is a limited supply of BitCrystals which can be used (burned) to create new card packs or traded with other players in the game. Players will be able to trade their Orbs and other game items easily within and outside the mobile app. Counterparty, will be used to create and customize the Orbs which are simply tokens. These will also be running on the Bitcoin blockchain and can be used as a cryptocurrency. They will all be assigned a unique Counterparty token name, this will verify their genuinity, features, and powers. Players will own their game items and cards not only within Spells of Genesis but also on the Blockchain enabling them to be freely traded outside the game. This gives birth to an incredible new game economy that has never been possible before. Token Sale on Koinify Once again, Koinify will be hosting one important Token Sale. The Everdreamsoft team chose Koinify because of its large experience and success with token sales. The Spells of Genisis token sale will be held starting June 2015 when people interested in supporting the project will be able to acquire BitCrystals. The Spells of Genisis team has recently celebrated a partnership with FoldingCoin as well. FoldingCoin is a coin that is rewarded for the pc’s computational power towards the “unfolding” of proteins. With this process people “hashing” for Foldingcoin, are contributing to medical research and helping researchers to study diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. The team is offering a total of 100,000 BitCrystals to folders and another 300 special unique “folding” trading cards, which will only be distributed this way. This cooperation is set to last until May the 31st, one day before the sale begins. By “mining” some Foldingcoin, it will be possible to earn some BitCrystals before the sale start.

bitcoinist	square-bitcoin-shares-innovate	Square Bitcoin Support: Shares Rise as Analysts Laud 'Ability to Innovate'	2017-11-20T08:00	Payment network Square has seen the value of its shares jump as a direct response to its Bitcoin integration. Square Shares Up 30% In 30 days After its announcement last week it was giving Bitcoin payments a limited trial for customers, Evercore ISI said the move was a major benefit to the business. “Following our meeting Wednesday with CFO Sarah Friar, we are upgrading Square to outperform,” analyst Rayna Kumar wrote to clients quoted by CNBC. “Square’s introduction of bitcoin on Square Cash reflects its ability to innovate.” The vote of confidence caps Square’s excellent run in October-November, shares closing up at 44.18 from 32.50 October 20. Evercore’s sentiment reflects the latest wave of faith in Bitcoin’s long-term promise to stem from some traditional finance entities. December will see CMEGroup’s much-hyped Bitcoin futures trading go live, with officials expressing a desire to “make Bitcoin not wild, nor wilder” through regulated institutional investor access. Slow Burn For Bitcoin’s Real Impact Kumar nonetheless forecast the Bitcoin’s direct impact on earnings for Square will surface only in the next few years rather than immediately. This was despite the broad acclaim the company has already received from users who rejoiced at their new ability to interact with the virtual currency. @SquareCash OMG! Just noticed I can now invest in Bitcoin using my Cash app! 👍🏽 I seriously think this is my most useful app….ever. — 🅱️rad Burns (@mr_burn5) November 8, 2017 Other analysts meanwhile have repeated excitement about Square and Bitcoin, including those from Credit Suisse, the CEO of which is an increasingly infamous Bitcoin naysayer. “We believe it could place SQ in an early-mover position as a mainstream fin-tech company providing crypto-currency services,” the bank’s analysts Paul Condra and Mrinalini Bhutoria wrote in a note quoted by Zacks. “SQ is also well positioned to enable crypto transactions at the physical point of sale.” The company could see revenue growth of 40% and 35% in 2018 and 2019 respectively, Kumar meanwhile added, in line with the 41% predictions for this year.

bitcoinist	starbucks-chairman-howard-schultz-believes-in-cryptocurrency	Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz Believes In Cryptocurrency - Just Not Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T22:30	Howard Schultz, Starbucks Corporation’s current Executive Chairman and former CEO, said that the company sees potential in blockchain technologies and some cryptocurrencies. Starbucks Wants To Go Cashless Without Bitcoin Starbucks has been a leader in the adoption of promising technologies, such as mobile payment features, and is set to continue the trend with a venture into cryptocurrencies and blockchain. As excitement builds around cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology, known as blockchain, Starbucks aims to take full advantage. The coffee giant will supposedly not be accepting the cryptocurrency Bitcoin though, the first decentralized cryptocurrency to be released back in 2009. Schultz expressed skepticism over the currency, stating, “I don’t believe that Bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future,” without further explaining his doubts. However, he did hint at the likelihood of Starbucks accepting other cryptocurrencies saying, I personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology. And that legitimacy and trust in terms of its consumer application will have to be legitimatized by a brand and a brick and mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction. If implemented, cryptocurrency payments could create and increase long-term shareholder value. Belief In Blockchain Schultz’s belief in blockchain technology is shared by other corporations who have either created their own blockchain, invested in a blockchain project, or begun to accept blockchain based cryptocurrencies. For example, Overstock now accepts payments in Bitcoin and other alt-coins, and Seagate Technologies has been reported to have large investments in the cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP). The company is not prepared for any immediate adoption of the technologies but believes that it will be extremely influential in the coming years. Schultz sees the high potential the brand has to legitimize the technology and give the consumer trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction. The chairman elaborated on the company’s dealings with blockchain, clarifying that the company will not be investing in any projects or creating their own. Will more retailers move to accept cryptocurrencies and integrate blockchain payments? Is Starbucks making the right decision? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

bitcoinist	stellar-lumens-lifted-blackwallet-hack	Stellar Lumens Lifted in Blackwallet Hack - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-16T03:45	Where to store your cryptocurrency can be a dilemma, especially when articles like this appear. With more digital currency entering the marketplace, hackers and cyber criminals are upping their efforts to steal it. It what could be considered a virtual bank robbery, online wallet provider Blackwallet was hacked over the weekend. The incursion resulted in the loss of over $400,000 of Stellar Lumens from customers’ accounts. It was reported that the group hijacked the server which hosts the virtual wallets and stole 669,920 XLM from them. Empty Wallets By hacking the domain name service, the attacker was able to inject code into wallets holding more than 20 Lumens and send them to another wallet. Shortly after the thefts, the hacker began to move the altcoins out of the target wallet and off the site. The pilfered crypto was sent to Bittrex, where it was converted into another digital currency to hide the hacker’s tracks. XLM is the ninth largest cryptocurrency by market capacity, which is just under $10 billion at the time of writing. It is currently trading at $0.55 after reaching an all-time high of $0.92 on January 4th. According to their website, Stellar is infrastructure that exists to facilitate cross-asset transfers of value, including payments. XLM is expected to be one of the big performers in 2018. Warnings Too Late According to reports, the Blackwallet team and other holders of Stellar Lumens tried to warn others via social media platforms to prevent them from logging in to the redirected domain. A Reddit user claiming to be the owner of the site posted: I am the creator of Blackwallet. Blackwallet was compromised today, after someone accessed my hosting provider account. He then changed the dns settings to those of its fraudulent website (which was a copy of blackwallet). I’ve contacted both SDF and Bittrex to ask them to block the bittrex’s account of the hacker. I’ve contacted my hosting provider to disable my account and my websites. He went on to apologize for the loss and promised to investigate the infiltration: I am sincerely sorry about this and hope that we will get the funds back. I am in talks with my hosting provider to get as much information about the hacker and will see what can be done with it. While most cryptocurrencies are encrypted and secure by nature, the systems we use to store them, such as web servers, can still easily be exploited. The website was still offline at the time of writing. With rising prices, crypto crimes have become more lucrative and will, no doubt, be on the increase this year. Do you store your coins on an exchange, a web wallet, or offline? Share your experiences in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay, Pexels, and Bitcoinist archives.

The blockchain project is being developed by a group of experienced MIT graduates. Many people are still struggling to invest into cryptocurrencies with fiat, but Enigma is trying to fix that with their platform. On August 21, the hackers were able to breach the website and social media accounts of the Enigma project. After the hackers managed to get into the social media accounts and emails of the Enigma team, they sent emails and messages urging investors and subscribes to send ethereum and bitcoin to the hackers address. The official Enigma team released a statement on their twitter account, urging users not to send any bitcoin or ethereum and to wait for further updates regarding the situation.

On July 17, hackers were able to hijack the official website of the CoinDash project and steal over $7 million worth of cryptocurrency from investors. Lately startups that have hosted or are planning to host ICOs have been victims of similar hacking attempts, which mostly target the slack channels of the projects. Startups are now trying to prevent these attacks by restricting their slack channels to new users and releasing their destination address for funds only a few hours before the actual ICO starts. Cybercrime in general is becoming an increasingly commonplace. In fact, even HBO has been the target of cyber thieves who managed to obtain unreleased materials from the media giant.

Surprisingly, about 80% of the films produced each year are never seen because they fail to secure the necessary distribution support from a major studio. Filmmakers are often left with no alternative but to rely on film festivals and similar channels. This has led to a situation where consumers face an erosion of choice as they mostly have access to major blockbuster releases promoted heavily by the studios. Independent filmmakers are left without adequate multichannel distribution relationships and a paucity of income. StreamSpace is currently in the process of building a novel distribution platform and an ecosystem that will create links between filmmakers and their fans, revolutionizing the film industry in much the same way the music industry has changed over the past decade or so. The filmmakers will be able to set a price for their content and receive payments immediately from consumers. The system’s secure monetization engine will place more than 90% of payments directly into the hands of the filmmakers. StreamSpace can also help filmmakers use crowdfunding techniques like ICOs, a powerful new tool that is more effective than conventional crowdfunding services. To ensure secure storage and transmission of files, StreamSpace will utilize encryption and blockchain technologies. Moreover, consumers will finally have direct access to quality film content from the independent creators. Robert Binning, the CEO of StreamSpace, says: Today, as video relies on high infrastructural costs on bandwidth and storage, only three companies can afford to deploy a global platform, and they have monopolized the market, creating an environment in which authors are not monetizing, users only reach low-quality content, and advertisers cannot reach their audiences. He continues: Our goal is to become the world’s leading destination for innovative film content, with a deep catalog that will enable personalized viewing experiences and that will be rewarding for our two core customers, independent filmmakers, and indie film aficionados. StreamSpace has been built around nine key components: Secure storage method Blockchain transaction ledger Front-end decoder and embedded HTML5 player Content recommendation engine Secure digital wallet Private token exchange Community-focused front end Social media channels Initial Coin Offering / Token crowdfunding campaigns StreamSpace operations are based on digital wallets and smart contracts through the Ethereum Virtual Machine capable of executing smart contracts on the Ethereum chain. All transactions on StreamSpace’s platform will take place using StreamShares (SSH) tokens. Film enthusiasts can watch a film by adding money to their digital wallet and initiating a token transfer to the wallet of the copyright owner. After receiving the tokens, the copyright owner can convert them to fiat currencies and withdraw. StreamSpace has circulated only a limited number of StreamShares in the market, and these tokens can be purchased with Ethereum or Bitcoin. Since the start of the StreamSpace ICO, the price of StreamShares has increased on a daily basis, and will soon reach the maximum price of $0.30. To find out more about StreamSpace and their ongoing ICO, please visit https://www.stream.space/. About StreamSpace: StreamSpace is a blockchain powered streaming video on demand service that looks to revolutionize the film industry by eliminating the existing distribution channels between the filmmakers and their customers. Making use of cutting-edge decentralized storage systems and blockchain technology, they have built a secure platform where independent filmmakers can exercise complete financial control over their creations and consumers have access to quality film content directly from the creators.

bitcoinist	sweden-set-become-first-economy-introduce-cryptocurrency	Sweden Set To Become First Economy To Introduce Own Cryptocurrency - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-17T17:00	Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, is looking at launching a national cryptocurrency called the e-Krona in as few as two years. Sweden’s position as potentially the world’s first cashless society has lead to a research note, written by HSBC economist James Pomeroy, entitled “Sweden’s big year: Can the economy overcome some challenges?” to identify the country as looking for international cooperation in developing an officially-sanctioned cryptocurrency. The note reads: The so-called e-Krona will have to be able to be used for small purchases, as a claim on the Riksbank and be accessible by companies, individuals and financial institutions at all times. Sweden’s Riksbank has very much been at the forefront of monetary advances over the years, as their governor Stefan Ingves is eager to point out: It was in Stockholm that the first modern banknote was created more than 350 years ago, and that it is here, in Sweden, that cash is currently taking its last breaths. Perhaps the Riksbank will be writing history again. How the e-Krona Might Be Managed It is speculated that the e-Krona would work by either having it work like cash currently does, with value stored on an app or card rather than a central database, or it could be in a registry-based system with the e-Krona stored in accounts held in a centralized database. Pomeroy writes : This is more complex, but may make the framework easier to expand and develop over time, and would likely require the use of blockchain technology. The system would be fraught with interesting technicalities and nuance for fans of cryptocurrency. A key element of what cryptocurrency offers is protection against scrutiny that cash payments currently afford, giving consumers security in the knowledge that their very private information is not being gathered and sold by third parties in order to profile them as customers or as a potential customer/product for others. Modern Day Privacy Concern It’s an issue that cashless societies are now facing, where every transaction can be tracked in minute detail and painting very revealing pictures of your personal life. This is where cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, shine. Cryptocurrencies can provide the same level of day-to-day anonymity that cash provides in an age where societies are essentially cashless. HSBC economist James Pomeroy notes that the Riksbank has: …issued a number of research articles on the topic, with the suggestion being that as cash usage continues to dwindle, the central bank may need to find another way to provide their populations with access to payments that are not via an intermediary such as a retail bank. A reassuring element appears to be that banks realize that centralized intermediaries may not be in the best interests of their customers or their data security concerns. They also realize that their future as a whole is threatened unless they adapt and keep apace with rapid Fintech developments in the world of finance. Do you still use cash? Do you see cryptocurrency replacing it? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Bitcoinist archives and Pixabay.
bitcoinist	swedish-bank-nordea-forbid-employees-trading-bitcoin	Swedish Bank Nordea Forbids Employees from Trading Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-26T02:30	Reports have emerged that the Swedish banking giant, Nordea, has forbidden its employees from trading Bitcoin and other digital currencies. No More Bitcoin Trading Swedish bank Nordea has ordered all of its employees to stop trading in cryptocurrencies. According to a recent report by Reuters, the Nordic region’s biggest bank has forbidden its 31,000 employees from trading Bitcoin due its high risks and volatility. A spokesman for Nordea told Reuters: The risks are seen as too high and the protection is insufficient for both the co-workers and the bank. Nordea’s decision surprised many members of the cryptocurrency and finance community. In the past, several Nordic banks have declared their stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. A Bloomberg article mentions that the governor of the Danish central bank, Lars Rohde, believes that Bitcoin is dangerous. The article also reports on Stefan Ingves, the governor of Sweden’s Riksbank, who told lawmakers that Bitcoin shouldn’t be considered a currency at all. Nordea is planning to officially implement the new ban by February 28th. Banks vs Bitcoin Nordic banks aren’t the only financial institutions that have taken actions related to cryptocurrency activities. Earlier this month, several major Australian banks started freezing banking accounts related to cryptocurrency activities. The major banks included the National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ, and Westpac Banking Corporation. Currently, very few accounts have been closed due to this new crackdown. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia stated through a spokesman that users will still be able to use their bank accounts to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as long as they comply with the terms and conditions of the bank. Many financial regulators worldwide have already given statements regarding their stance on cryptocurrencies and their risks. Experts fear that more banks and financial institutions worldwide are going to further crack down on bank accounts that are being used for cryptocurrency trading. Some consumer protection agencies and financial regulatory bodies fear that these actions by banks may breach the rights of bank holders. What are your thoughts on Nordea’s decision to ban its employees from trading cryptocurrencies? Do you think that more banks should do the same? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	switzerland-wants-crypto-nation-france-germany-want-regulation	Switzerland Wants a Crypto-Nation, France and Germany Want Regulation - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-20T04:00	Countries across the world remain divided over the cryptocurrency revolution that has emerged over the past year. Some, such as China, strive to eradicate all instances of it, but others, including Switzerland, are embracing the blockchain with open arms. Ahead of a potential crypto G20 summit which could result in a wave of regulatory action, Switzerland has emerged in full support of the technology as voiced via Economics Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann. Crypto Nation The affluent municipality of Zug has become the home for numerous blockchain companies, including the Ethereum Foundation, according to reports. A translation from an address given by the minister indicates willingness for expansion from this hub of blockchain tech to the rest of the country: The Canton of Zug, the Cryptovalley, has come a long way. There we can gain experience. If the experiences in Zug are positive, we can extend that to the nation. Therefore the statement: It does not need to stay with Cryptovalley, it should become the crypto-nation. Schneider-Ammann went on to further extol the virtues of fintech innovation, saying that Switzerland has grown by that same acceptance of pioneering technology and financial stability: Now we have arrived at an innovative moment in the financial world. Cryptocurrencies are part of the fourth industrial revolution. We look at what possibilities can arise from it. For my part, I try to identify the opportunities, the risks and the opportunities, and decide: Is this a future business with future jobs or is it not? That’s why I support the circles that deal with it. To Regulate or Not to Regulate The minister went on to state that it was too early to regulate cryptocurrencies as there is no clear direction where the innovation will lead. The important thing to note is that Switzerland is not in the EU. Therefore, it is free from the multifarious and often stifling rafts of EU regulations that other nations, such as France and Germany, have to deal with. He also poignantly said: We are who we are. We must and want to be able to determine our own future. We make our experiences and of course we make cross-comparisons with the neighbors and the distant competitors. France and Germany are proposing heavy regulations, possibly in an effort to stifle competing nations such as Switzerland, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The summit will be held in March where the proposals on regulation will be submitted as a joint French-German position to their G20 counterparts. The UK may also be with Switzerland behind blockchain innovation if it can ever get over its Brexit woes and finally move forwards with its fintech industry. Will some nations of Europe become hubs for crypto companies? Share your views in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pxhere, Pixabay, and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	synthestech-project-on-synthesis-of-valuable-metals-has-successfully-completed-pre-sale-and-launches-ico	Synthestech Project on Synthesis of Valuable Metals Has Successfully Completed Pre-Sale and Launches ICO - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T24:00	With the growing popularity of ICO as a tool for attracting investments, projects from the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, as well as from a real sector of the economy, have started launching Token Sales. Synthestech is one of these projects, a research center that is developing an innovative technology for synthesis of precious metals and valuable chemical elements. Pre-ICO is already finished and, as a result, more than $ 400.000 (Hard Cap) was raised, even before the official campaign launch. Investors from Russia, China, and Japan have shown special interest in the project. About Technology Leading scientific institutions have started to seriously study the phenomenon of Low-energy nuclear reactions or Cold fusion not a very long time ago. The amount of experimental material is enormous; powerful theories are put forward which do not contradict the standard physical models. Today, there are even successful attempts to commercialize this phenomenon. Andrea Rossi, an Italian entrepreneur, in collaboration with the physicist S. Foccardi, have managed to create a reactor that generates thermal energy. Cold Fusion also has another application: the process is accompanied by nuclear transmutations of elements. Many experimenters noted that they obtained valuable elements, including platinum group metals. Synthestech has focused on the development of the transmutation technology for production of platinum metals. Such technology will enable to obtain platinum and other valuable elements from cheap raw materials. However, this is possible already today using the high-energy nuclear reactions (nuclear fusion), but this is incredibly expensive. Synthestech researchers have figured out a way to reduce the costs of elements transmutation through low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR). These are reactions that occur at room temperatures and do not require large energy impacts. Several hundred experiments have been carried out and platinum group metals were obtained. In the matrix consisting of low-value elements such as iron, copper, tungsten, etc., after processing emerged new elements, among which the valuable ones were platinum, iridium, ruthenium, etc. That means, that an artificial production of valuable chemical elements of the platinum group has been carried out. ICO will be launched to continue research and to transfer the technology from the experimental to the industrial level. Market Analysis Today the world produces and utilizes about 200 tons of platinum, about the same amount of palladium and about 50 tons of other platinum metals. In general, it is approximately 450 tons. The prices range from $ 900 to $ 1500 per troy ounce. According to estimations, the world market for platinum metals is worth about $ 14 billion. However, there is a serious shortage in all segments, since the platinum group metals have unique physical and chemical properties and are irreplaceable in such industries as medicine, jewelry, oil refining, electronics and instrument engineering, etc. Constant demand and the growing deficit result in the permanently high prices. In many industries, there are no analogues to this precious metal, and it will be actively used for a long time. In addition, platinum metals are rare in nature and practically never occur in pure form. Palladium and platinum are traded on all major exchanges in the world, there are hundreds of foundations that make long-term investments into these metals with an investment horizon of 10-20 years. Metals are considered to be the most conservative assets, demand is growing in times of crisis and uncertainty in other markets. Road Map and Perspectives of the Project The project has colossal medium and long-term perspectives and is not influenced by governments and other regulators of the cryptocurrency market. STT Token is a dividend token that grants the right to receive profit from the developed technology and is provided with real assets – a modern scientific laboratory and a research base. While, in the short run, one can make money trading almost any coins and tokens, in the long run, there will remain just a few of today’s ICOs. One of them is the Synthestech project. Currently, the team faces a new ambitious task. They plan to transfer the research results into the full-scale technology and production. This requires expensive analytical and industrial equipment, as well as a separate laboratory complex. Construction of such a laboratory will attract a huge number of specialists from all over the world. The profit yielded from the development and use of such technology will be hundreds and thousands of percent. Capitalization will increase many times after the laboratory launch. Investors will receive the first dividends from the production in early 2020, and the growth of token prices, according to analysts, may reach 300-400% after the end of Crowd Sale. Official Resources and Contacts Further information and results of the Synthestech’s work, as well as details about the ICO terms and the team members, can be found on the project’s website, in social media networks and in White Paper of the project.

bitcoinist	syscoin-business-on-the-blockchain	Syscoin: Business on the Blockchain - Bitcoinist.com	2014-08-11T02:54	A coin that has received much attention in the past few weeks due to the innovation they will bring with the release of their coin is Syscoin. Syscoin aims to provide all sorts of businesses the infrastructure to trade goods, assets, digital certificates, and others in a secure way. The way it differentiates itself though is that it implements this marketplace, this infrastructure directly into the blockchain which is something unseen in cryptocurrency. Detailed information regarding Syscoin can be found in their whitepaper Syscoin Specifications 60 second block time 2 billion total coins 128 block reward Uses Kimoto’s Gravity Well to retarget difficulty Scrypt Algorithm 18% premine Among the features that will be implemented in Syscoin, there are definitely some that stand out due to their lack of presence in other coins: Business on the Blockchain : Buy and sell anything with Syscoin’s distributed marketplace integrated into the blockchain.This isn’t a cryptocurrency plus a marketplace.It’s a marketplace built into a cryptocurrency.The Syscoin network enables the creation of marketplaces of any kind, ranging from small community trading platforms to large corporate marketplaces like eBay to fully encrypted hidden marketplaces. This does not limit itself to marketplaces that accept only Syscoin. Syscoin’s blockchain innovations are merely an infrastructure upon which marketplaces can be built. Brokerage on the Blockchain : Exchange discrete data directly on the Blockchain. Documents like deeds, wills, trusts, stocks, bonds and contracts can now be created, mutually agreed upon, and transferred without the necessity of a third-party to authenticate the transaction; the Syscoin network itself acts as the third party, guaranteeing cryptographically-verifiable authenticity. Certificates on the Blockchain: Using the cryptography of the Blockchain; Issue, authorize, and exchange digital certificates. With Syscoin, anyone can register as a certificate issuer and issue provably-unique certificates which can be authenticated by anyone using Syscoin’s cryptographic proof of work. This allows for the creation and free exchange of a any kind of digital asset such as stocks, bonds, ownership certificates, warranties, receipts, tickets, certifications, diplomas, software licenses. When looking over the specifications for Syscoin, there is one that must have caught your eye. An 18% premine. To break this down, 15% is used as an IPO, and the remaining 2% will be for the developers. The IPO has been very successful to date, and even more so considering that it will end on the 16th of August. They have almost reached a total of 700 bitcoin through the IPO. They achieved their goal of 465 bitcoin the first phase, and have reached 200 bitcoin out of over 1000 in the second phase. It should also be taken in account that the IPO is being held by moolah which is a trusted exchange and payment processor in cryptocurrency. This has increased due to their purchase of Mintpal earlier last month, Personally, I find Syscoin to be a very ambitious project, and the interesting thing is that the developers have already shown proof that the features they claim to implement are already ready for release. All that is left to do is wait for the release date which is quite exciting. It is not usual to see developers who have their coin ready weeks before launch, and for that, we must give them credit. Whether or not Syscoin succeeds will depend on the amount of transparency showed by the developers alongside the innovation that they bring to the cryptocurrency world. For now though, it seems as if Syscoin is definitely a successful project. Yet, we must wait to see if that will end up being the final result.
bitcoinist	tales-terror-tether	Misleading Tales of Terror about Tether - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-29T03:45	As crypto markets slowly start to rebound and head back upwards, the mainstream media just cannot help themselves from disseminating more FUD. As if actively searching for any excuse to decry Bitcoin and its crypto brethren, we find ourselves repeatedly reading articles fueled by fear. The latest to sensationalize on the hype using terms such as “total market collapse” and “bloodbath” is Australia’s News.com.au, which claims that Tether could bring the entire market to its knees. While Tether, which is supposedly pegged to the dollar, is a concern, it is only currently used for 9.6% of all crypto trades, according to Coinmarketcap. How this can cause an “80% crash” in the price of Bitcoin is still a little unclear. Fear and Loathing The report goes on to call stablecoin Tether a “ticking time bomb.” It cites bloggers accusing crypto exchange Bitfinex of creating USDT out of thin air without having USD deposits to back up the asset. Effectively, this is how most cryptocurrencies are created, until they are traded with Bitcoin or Ethereum, which has been brought with fiat. The finger pointing continues, and Bitfinex is in the firing line as one anonymous analyst says: It is highly unlikely that tether is growing through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in response to market conditions. The company has since untethered itself from audit firm Friedman LLP, which had been working on an audit of Tether but has yet to provide any results. Tether had this to say in an emailed statement: As tether is the first company in the space to undergo this process and pursue this level of transparency, there is no precedent set to guide the process nor any benchmark against which to measure its success. Bitfinex, meanwhile, retorted with its own threats against those accusing it of wrongdoing: To date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a result, Bitfinex has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against this agitator and his associates. Uncertainty Abounds Tether has had more than its share of critics, with co-founder of cryptocurrency payment service TenX, Julian Hosp, telling CNBC : Tether gets issued out of thin air through a very complex system, supposedly whenever $US1 is deposited in return. At the moment, tether is priced at around $US1.6 billion, which supposedly means $US1.6 billion actually went into that cryptocurrency. According to some reports, however, there isn’t actually $US1.6 billion backing up the token. Since many exchanges and other cryptocurrencies are connected to tether, any finding that its stated value is untrue would send the market into a significant decline. He went on to speculate that a 15% crash was more likely in such a scenario. This sounds a little bit more realistic than the 80% price collapse that the original report dramatized. Since markets have already crashed by over 40% this month and are returning back up the trend line, a 15% crash would be a mere blip that crypto markets could easily overcome. According to Coinmarketcap, Tether currently has a $2.2 billion market cap on paper and is primarily traded on Hong Kong registered OKEx, followed by Binance. Tether is the fourth highest traded crypto by volume but has less than ten percent of the total trade. Do you use USDT to trade and would you consider changing? Add your comments below.

bitcoinist	teenage-bitcoin-millionaire-plans-building-worlds-best-university-dubai	Teenage Bitcoin Millionaire Plans on Building 'World's Best University' in Dubai - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-31T01:00	Erik Finman, the teenage Bitcoin millionaire, plans on creating the ‘world’s best university’ in the city of Dubai to combat outmoded teaching methods. Most of the time when a person decides to head down the path less traveled, it usually ends in disaster. Yet there are times when a person perseveres and then prospers. Such is the case of Erik Finman, the teenage Bitcoin millionaire. He’s only 19, but he’s parlayed his initial Bitcoin investment into millions of dollars. Now he plans on building the “ world’s best university ” in the city of Dubai. Grandma’s Gift Leads to Millions The tale of the teenage Bitcoin millionaire is fascinating. Back when he was 12 (in 2011), his grandmother gave him a gift of $1,000. His brother Scott gave him a tip about getting into Bitcoin. Back then, a single Bitcoin was only worth $12, so he bought as much as he could and then decided to hodl them. However, the story gets a lot more interesting. Erik Finman had a terrible time going through the school system. He was bored and unmotivated. He says one teacher even told him that he would never amount to anything, so he should just drop out of school and start flipping burgers at McDonalds. Finman’s parents decided to pull him out of school, which is what he wanted, and began homeschooling him. In 2013, he cashed out some of his bitcoins to start an online education company called Botangle. This venture was designed for frustrated students like himself to find good teachers over video chat. He then began to intern at Silicon Valley start-ups and moved to San Francisco at age 15. A Family Affair Finman now owns 401 bitcoins, which is worth $4.9 million currently. He wants to use some of his Bitcoin wealth to create a new university in Dubai, and his whole family is involved in the project. His family already runs online teaching training in Dubai, using technology he developed through his Botangle project. Looking at his family, you could see why homeschooling was a really good choice. His father has a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford, and his mom has a PhD in physics from Stanford. His brothers went to MIT. There will be lots of ups and downs for cryptocurrency on the way to the top! It’s success is inevitable! It’s unstoppable. — Erik Finman (@erikfinman) December 22, 2017 As for Dubai, Erik Finman chose it because: Dubai has really become the centre of the world. It already has the tallest building, it already has the biggest malls – I think it deserves to have the best education system in the world too, and I know that fits a lot of [the UAE’s] goals. Finman personally believes that college is often a waste of time due to outmoded methods of education, which is why his university will feature a system that helps students like himself that are continually frustrated. As for Bitcoin, Finman has no concerns about the cryptocurrency’s price fluctuations. He adds: But I think Bitcoin definitely has more to go, and I think cryptocurrency as a whole has a lot more to go. It’s the next big thing. The only way you can take down by Bitcoin is not through its own doing, but if you make some better alternative to it. Whatever the winning cryptocurrency is – and right now that’s Bitcoin – will get to millions of dollars of coin. It’s quite possible that Erik Finman and his family could achieve something spectacular. They’re obviously a very driven family. So far, the teenage Bitcoin millionaire has been doing everything right. Finman primarily holds bitcoins, but he also has some investments in Ethereum and Litecoin. Do you think Erik Finman will succeed in creating an innovative university that breaks the current mold? Don’t you wish you had invested in Bitcoin when it was only $12 per coin? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of Facebook/Erik Finman, Twitter/@erikfinman, and Pixabay.
bitcoinist	tether-now-supported-on-the-ethereum-network	Tether Now Supported on the Ethereum Network - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-08T12:30	Tether has switched from the previously used Omni protocol to the Ethereum network, citing lower fees and faster confirmations for the switch. “Tethered” to the Dollar Tethers are a very controversial product in the cryptocurrency space and have been for months on end. They are a cryptocurrency that is backed by traditional fiat currencies, such as the United States Dollar or the Euro. Many exchanges have adopted tethers, as they offer a method of implementing USD pairs without having to use dollars. This loophole can allow exchanges to work with “dollars” without having to jump through regulatory hoops. The old tether system used the Omni protocol, a system that allows for custom smart contracts using the Bitcoin network’s security. The switch to Ethereum is exciting, as they’ve already migrated USDT and EURT to the new network. The company announced that the switch was due to high fees and slow confirmations, two problems that Ethereum offers a solution to. Tether has launched the new contracts and is in the process of transferring value across the chains. It may take some time for a full roll out onto Ethereum. Concerns About the Token Tether has come under fire as of late for some questionable actions. Many are still awaiting a full third-party audit on the tether reserves. The reserves are bank accounts that Tether claims have a matching number of dollars as the number of USDT in circulation. More eyebrows were raised when it was discovered that tether has a clause in their ToS stating they have no obligation redeem the tethers at face value. Tethers can only be purchased by institutional investors, not the public. So far, over $1.5 billion has been produced by Tether, which is currently being using in circulation by exchanges and individuals worldwide. Do you think that Tether’s switch to the Ethereum blockchain was a smart move? Do you use tethers? Let us know in the comments down below! Images courtesy of Pexels, AdobeStock
bitcoinist	the-digital-currency-round-table-discussion-events-promoting-bitcoin-awareness	The Digital Currency Round Table Discussion Events – Promoting Bitcoin Awareness - Bitcoinist.com	2014-12-06T14:54	The Digital Currency RoundTable is a joint operation between Coin Apex, the NYC-based tech startup incubator and the New York City King’s College that aims to organize a series of discussions and debates about digital currencies. These discussions not only give finance, politics, economics and media students a more complete picture of the Bitcoin landscape and showcases its enormous impact and relevant challenges to overcome but are also intended to bring awareness and the widespread of information about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Sarah Tyre, the Communication and Marketing Director for Coin Apex stated: “A growing amount of organizations are recognizing the significance of this powerful technology and are providing the momentum needed to fuel interest in events which aim to heighten awareness and understanding of cryptocurrency, such as The Digital Currency Roundtable.” The RoundTable events goal is to get various experts of different areas of the Bitcoin sector in a battery of public discussions and Q&A sessions, to dissect some of the major issues around digital currency. The first event promoted by the Digital Currency RoundTable took place last November in the City Room on The King’s College campus, located at 56 Broadway in lower Manhattan, and was attended by a series of entrepreneurs, students, journalists and several crypto enthusiasts. Bailey Reutzel, writer for PaymentsSource, and payment tech reporter who focuses heavily on the fast-evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem was the active moderator in this first debate. The Speakers Alex Waters Alex has been involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem since the beginning. With a background in programming and management, he has worked on Bitcoin with core dev, Bitinstant as CIO, and now runs an incubator for several Bitcoin startups in NY. As a programmer and tech startup entrepreneur, his understanding of the technology can lend to the discussion. Ryan Straus Ryan is a Chair of the Payments Practice Group at Riddell Williams P.S. in Seattle. Ryan is passionate about responsible innovation in finance and, as a commercial lawyer with a background in consumer financial services and technology; he brings a unique perspective to conversations about the role of regulation in the Bitcoin space. Robert Adler Former COO of Tradehill, Managing Director at Strategic Value Partners, CAO at Bear Sterns Asset Management, and VP at Goldman Sachs, Robert is now building a Bitcoin hedge fund here in NY. His experience on Wall Street and knowledge of the Bitcoin industry brings a well-versed financial perspective to the table. The discussion focus The debate focused primarily the future of digital currency and how to correctly define Bitcoin, it being more as a currency or simply a protocol. It was also addressed the issue of Regulatory arbitrage – Companies are trying to avoid unfriendly regulatory states and this forces entrepreneurs to open their companies oversees. Another topic that was intensively debated was the BitLicence, it’s pro and cons, and how legislation can raise barriers to the crypto ecosystem expansion and development, thus the need of balancing the regulatory system with the companies’ demands; Bitlicence is an important precedent that will influence the regulatory process around the world and as such, it should try to strike balance, while it can affect the stability and incentives for new companies to start betting on digital currency. It was assumed that the regulatory pressures on the banks along the high risk involved prevent entrepreneurs to innovate and take part on the ecosystem. The speakers also referred to Banking friction and bitcoin as a worldwide currency with a large potential to cut expenses to financial businesses in about 90% and also to overthrow companies like Western Union vs the problems that global free transactions can carry when regarding money laundering and illicit item free access. In the end the guests expressed their opinion on what’s the competition on the space and the need for cheaper and faster payments systems followed by a Q&A with the attendants. The organization was pretty happy with the outcome of this first RoundTable discussion and the Digital Currency RoundTable is already preparing for the next round of discussions, supposedly to be held in the 1st quarter of 2015. Details of the next upcoming event will be released soon. Link to source: courtesy of Sarah Tyre, DCRT and Coin Apex Photo Source: The Digital Currency RoundTable
bitcoinist	the-dollar-far-outstrips-cryptocurrency-in-illicit-activity-spending	The Dollar Far Outstrips Cryptocurrency in Illicit Activity Usage - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-03T11:30	A recent panel held by the US Senate Judiciary on modernizing anti-money laundering laws found that only a small percentage of illicit activity spending is done through cryptocurrency. If there’s one thing that media outfits love to do is hype up the drama and intrigue, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency. Most mentions of virtual currencies are usually accompanied by a blurb about how criminal groups use cryptocurrency for nefarious reasons. Of course, the Dark Web is usually brought up in how people use Bitcoin and other crypto to buy drugs, finance terrorism, hire assassins, and so on. However, perception does not equate to reality. This was shown during a recent panel held by the US Senate Judiciary where it was revealed that the use of cryptocurrency for illicit activities is actually rather small. Looking to Curtail Money Laundering The panel was held to discuss Bill S1241 : Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. The bill is designed to give law enforcement the tools needed to prevent, identify, and prosecute those who wish to break the law. Of interest to the panel was a study by the Tax Justice Network that said that the United States is one of the easiest places in the world for criminal elements (human traffickers, corrupt politicians, and terrorists) to hide illicit money. Crime is Now a Global Enterprise One of the key aspects of the hearing was how criminal activity is carried out on a global scale. Criminal groups are now following in the footsteps of economies and financial systems that have moved from being local to being global. Kenneth Blanco, a deputy attorney general at the US Department of Justice, said the following : Transnational criminal organizations, kleptocrats, cybercriminal groups, terrorists, drug cartels, and alien smugglers alike must find ways to disguise the origins of the proceeds of their crimes so that they can use the profits without jeopardizing their source. Illicit activities are obviously pretty popular. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that more than $2 trillion is made in annual proceeds from illicit activities. Money laundering is a key concern and can be done through multiple methods: prepaid access cards, digital currencies, illicit cash, and trade-based money laundering. Crypto a Figurative Drop in the Bucket There is no denying that cryptocurrency is handy for illicit activities. It bypasses national banks, government red tape, and international borders in an instant. Then there’s the supposed anonymity promised by many virtual currencies. The poster child for crypto and the Dark Web is the infamous Silk Road site that was shut down a few years ago. Yet for all the bad press that crypto gets for being a facilitator of illegal goods, the US Senate hearing actually presented a different picture. According to the deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the US Department of the Treasury, Jennifer Fowler, the currency of choice for bad guys is still the old fashioned US dollar. She notes: Although virtual currencies are used for illicit transactions, the volume is small compared to the volume of illicit activity through traditional financial services. However, don’t expect the media, TV, or the movies to accurately portray this bit of reality. It’s more exciting (or grabs higher viewer numbers) to tout the dangers of cryptocurrency and the shadowy existence of the Dark Web. Are you surprised that the US dollar is far more popular for illicit activities than virtual currencies? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	the-life-of-litecoin-without-lee	The life of Litecoin without Charlie Lee	2018-01-22T02:30	Crypto traders can be a fickle bunch as last month’s hero can quickly become this month’s zero. Altcoins can go out of favor just as fast as they came into it and can rapidly slide down the market capacity charts in favor of a shiny new contender. One stalwart of the crypto world that has suffered this fate lately is Litecoin, and many are speculating about the effect the actions of its founder have played on its current performance. Litecoin has always been relatively stable in comparison to other altcoins which surge, spike, and crash at the whim of a Tweet or the word of a shill. There has recently been some speculation that LTC founder and ex-Google engineer Charlie Lee selling off his entire stash could have affected the market price and confidence in the coin. Lite Flying Often described as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin rose steadily from around $10 in April 2017 to around $55 in November. It has proved to be one of the most stable virtual currencies out there and aims to provide a faster, more efficient payments system than Bitcoin, which has its value considered more as an investment than a currency. Litecoin literally lifted off between the end of November and mid-December 2017 when it shot up around 570% to a record high of $370 on December 14th. Since then, it has been on a downward trend, aside from a short revival just after New Year, falling back to $192, where it trades today. Year on year, however, LTC is still up an epic 4,700% and was one of the best performing cryptocurrencies of 2017. Charlie’s Angel Unlike the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee is somewhat of an internet celebrity and can be very vocal about his project. This has attracted criticism from unforgiving netizens who repeatedly accused him of promoting his own coin, the success of which would fill his own coffers. His decision to sell his Litecoin holdings and donate a portion to charity came in response to this criticism as a way of commenting without conflict of interest. Some see Lee’s exit as an advantage for the altcoin, which can now grow without his interference, while others speculate that it was a detrimental decision. There has been further speculation that without Lee holding so much of the asset, he is free to enter into partnerships with other companies to offer tech support and guidance on blockchain development and acceptance of LTC, should they use it. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has been mentioned a few times since the company has been researching a blockchain payments provider. Founders of companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Google do not get lambasted when they endorse their products, but life in crypto land seems to be different. Charlie Lee did not give up on Litecoin, he simply turned it into a truly decentralized currency in the hands of the people, where even the founder cannot control it any longer. Will Litecoin soar again in 2018? Share your views in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	the-noose-tightens-us-senate-meeting-with-market-regulators-over-cryptocurrency	The Noose Tightens? US Senate Meeting with Market Regulators Over Cryptocurrency - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-11T06:00	Bitcoin regulations may be on the way as the US Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to meet with top market regulators in February over cryptocurrency. The noose may be tightening around Bitcoin and its digital brethren in the United States in the coming months. According to Reuters, the Senate Banking Committee will be meeting with some top financial regulators in early February. Their topic of concern – cryptocurrency. Are Regulations Coming? Right now, there are no federal regulators that oversee cryptocurrency within the US. The government (and most importantly, the IRS) view crypto as property that’s subject to capital gains taxes. However, this may change in the future. The Senate Banking Committee will be talking to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton to discuss Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, along with any risks that crypto trading can bring to the public. Will this meeting lead to future Bitcoin regulations? My magic 8-ball says that it’s a distinct possibility. Governments Yearn for Control The reality is that the CFTC and SEC have been staking out some jurisdiction over crypto. The CFTC did allow both CME and CBOE to begin listing Bitcoin futures contraacts last month. However, they are now reviewing their process for this after receiving some criticism. It should be noted that both the SEC and CFTC have issued warnings about the volatility of cryptocurrency and that they may not be able to protect investors from crypto scam artists. There are always those looking to earn some ill-gotten gains by using crypto as the lure. Case in point is BitConnect, who were shut down by the state of Texas over their claims of monetary rewards. Yet any time government committees get together, it should be a cause for concern. The reality is that any national government will not be too friendly with an economic system that lies outside of their control. To that end, you can bet that regulations are at the forefront of every senator’s mind when that meeting rolls around. Of course, one of the chief draws for cryptocurrency is its lack of centralization and regulation. Many view virtual currency as an expression of economic freedom, but governments look at crypto in a different light: something to control and to tax. Shidan Gouran, president of Global Blockchain Technologies Corp. summed up the thought that one of the reasons why cryptocurrency was so valuable was due to a lack of regulation. He said : We believe that the greatest threat is regulation. Several governments across the world have clamped down on exchanges, some halting trading altogether. Others have gone on to outright ban the use of Bitcoin. Sudden government actions in major Bitcoin trading hubs stand to disrupt the market, with the potential to severely affect the utility of bitcoin — and accordingly, the value. Are you worried that the upcoming Senate Banking Committee meeting will lay the cornerstone for increased Bitcoin regulation? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	the-north-american-bitcoin-conference-2016-day-1	The North American Bitcoin Conference 2016: Day 1 - Bitcoinist.com	2016-01-21T22:53	This piece was written by Ryan Strauss. This weekend, I am in Miami for The North American Bitcoin Conference. This is the third Bitcoin Conference that I have ever attended; the first was in Chicago in June 2014, the second was in San Diego last month. I am incredibly excited to be here. Every Bitcoin conference or Meetup I have ever attended has been three things; informative, uplifting, and nerdy. There’s nothing better than being able to Nerd-Out with the other Bitcoiners present. As you likely know, it is very difficult to have deep conversations about Bitcoin usually! Also read: Meet the Guys Who Paid $10,000 for a Bitcoin Comic Book Over the next two days, I’ll be providing an Hour-By-Hour look into the craziness that is a huge Bitcoin Conference. TNABC does a great job running these events, sourcing top quality speakers from around the industry, and getting the word out for the best and brightest to attend. This should provide some good insight into the current state of and trends within the Bitcoin Industry. So, here we go. Below is a running recap and summary of TNABC in Miami, January 21 st -22 nd, 2016. Morning [7:30 AM]: Wake up. Running on 2.5 hours of sleep from writing my blog on Medium late last night. [8:34 AM]: Dropped off downtown by a good friend. Call Lyft, start heading towards the Miami Beach Convention Center. [9:12 AM]: Get to Miami Beach Convention Center, realize that the conference isn’t actually here. It’s at the James L. Knight Convention Center in downtown Miami, not Miami Beach. [9:46 AM]: Finally arrive at the right location. Pay in United States Dollars. Run into John Scianna, a bitcoin entrepreneur who I only knew through Facebook and by-name. Discuss our current work in-person for our first time. [10:01 AM]: Arrive at check-in location for the conference. Said hi to Moe Levin, who I met in 2014 at TNABC in Chicago. Was informed that my name is not on the press pass list. Mention how Caleb Chen approved a press pass for me. Get into the conference for free. [10:04 AM]: Bump into Caleb at the table for Ledger, “The Bitcoin Security Company,” as their slogan goes. Talked to the team for a bit. Learned that Ledger is creating hardware wallets which store your private keys in them. This is essentially a form of cold storage. Saw a demonstration of how one of these work. Ledger also had 4 blockchain-enabled debit cards on display. The wallet is paired with “companion apps,” which are a user-friendly interface for detailing the transactions. The intention behind these products is to give Bitcoin a physical element that people can relate to, similar to their house keys. Ledger sold their hardware wallets on site; planning to buy one with Bitcoin later today. [10:05 AM]: See David Ripley of Glidera from afar. I first met David in late 2013 at a Bitcoin Meetup in Chicago when Glidera was just starting. David was deep in conversation with someone. It is amazing to see Glidera doing well. [10:10 AM]: Talk to t0, a team lead by Patrick Byrne aiming to decrease settlement costs and inefficiencies. Was told that the team recently conducted the world’s first documented Bond transaction on a blockchain. Was told that the team is working closely with the SEC to enable trading of other securities on this platform, including the shorting of stocks. [10:13 AM]: Actual-overheard the following comment while walking between booths, while overhearing a conversation about Bitcoin and its potential applications in the Marijuana industry: “But where do you get the cannabis?” [10:14 AM]: Talk to the team at Block C, a mining services company for less experienced Bitcoin Miners as well as those looking for American based options. Was told that there has been concern recently in the Mining community about centralization of mining power and also about the over centralization on Chinese or Hong Kong based Mining operations. Block C provides the opportunity to run a Bitcoin miner for you in proportion to the amount you invest. Additionally, if you want them to run an old or new Bitcoin miner for you, you can drop it off at their offices and they will run it for you. They are not a mining pool, I was told, because they structure their mining investments in ways that aren’t pooled. Yes, they partner with other pools, but each miner at Block C is run individually. Seems to be a low barrier to entry here for anyone looking to get involved in mining; seems to be run by competent people. [10:25 AM]: Spoke with the team at DASH. DASH is an impressive and ambitious endeavor, aimed at providing an alternative to Bitcoin with better incentive structures built in for the community. I was told that the Bitcoin network has ~200x more processing power now than Google, and that this infrastructure should be used for incentives “other than providing transactional security,” other than rewarding the coinbase to only miners. As their pamphlet reads, “Dash is an open-source project that delivers safe decentralized financial solutions.” DASH provides incentive structures which reward many parties involved for the coinbase component of a block-reward, not just the miners. We discussed how rewarding solely the miners encourages centralization of mining, and it doesn’t build in strong incentives to reward the rest of the community. I was told that the Bitcoin network only has 5800 full-nodes running at this point, while the DASH network has 4000 full-nodes running; through the unique incentives that Dash provides, the hope is that it will encourage a healthier network and more full-nodes on the DASH network than on Bitcoin in the long run. Additionally, DASH had a really sweet looking soda-vending machine that can be used for purchase with DASH (coins). Another unique feature of their network is InstantX, which provides instant transaction confirmations that supposedly confirm payments within 1-4 seconds! [10:38 AM]: Run into John, who I met at the Bitcoin Conference in San Diego last month. He is still working on his Local Bitcoins business and also offers educational and consulting services. He spent so much time on his Bitcoin work last semester that it significantly hurt his grades. [10:41 AM]: After a flurry of talks, was flustered. Run to the sign-in table asking where the actual talks and panels for the conference are. Ask where is a good place to work. [10:42 AM]: Literally bump into Mate Tokay, CEO of Bitcoinist, who I had met originally at the Conference in San Diego last month, out of nowhere. Mate was in from Hungary and we talked briefly about what was up with our lives. Mate and Caleb saw the potential in me, believed in me, and helped give me this opportunity to write. [10:44 AM]: Post up at the Bitcoinist table in the atrium next to the room where the conference is. Meet Scott, a.k.a. “Talon”, who I had been corresponding with over Telegram for the past month. Had a spirited, 20-minute conversation about Bitcoinist and the successes of the site recently. [10:59 AM]: Finally downloaded the AirBitz app. This is the best iPhone Bitcoin wallet I have ever seen to-date. I am impressed by it’s simplicity. [11:01 AM]: Mate pays me in Bitcoin for the commission I earned for my first sale for Bitcoinist, which was a $45 press release that I sold last week. We discussed how awesome it was that Bitcoinist pays employees in Bitcoin. Mate showed me the basics of how to use the AirBitz app. [11:10 AM]: The Bitcoin transaction from Mate confirmed to the blockchain. 16,902.08 Bits, which equates to exactly $7. [11:46 AM]: Moe Levin swings by the Bitcoinist table. He is looking for an additional speaker for the panel on Bitcoin in the media. Mate and Scott volunteer to speak on the panel as needed. [11:48 AM]: All caught up, finally wrote everything up to this point. Afternoon [12:05 PM]: Tone Vays, Bitcoin technical trading expert, walks up to the Bitcoinist table. He recognized me from the conference in San Diego because I spoke with him briefly there and also asked questions during his talk. Tone described Bitcoin trading as “a sandbox of trading with random quicksand holes.” Tone also said that Bitcoin may be overpriced currently because we are still waiting for another wave of users to the like that we saw in 2013. Tone feels that 2013 was unprecedented in terms of the amount of new-users who joined the Bitcoin community that year. [12:14 PM]: Random comment overheard among people leaving the talks and the panel: “they switched and started talking about the block-size debate.” Also, “even Factom started talking about the block-size debate.” In my opinion, these “debates” are actually healthy for the community, because they bring more people into the decision-making-discussion. [12:23 PM]: Spoke with Joe Colangelo from Consumers’ Research (established in 1919). Joe informed me that tomorrow after his talk he is releasing a Whitepaper around mechanisms and processes for the insurance industry and legal community to follow when working-with Bitcoin or Blockchain companies. We spoke about how important it is for the Bitcoin community to work with regulators and the legal community, not “against” them. We spoke about how impactful blockchain technology will be in the years ahead. Joe said that he is involved in the space because he wants to tell his children he helped play a part in this-thing-that-changed-the-world, and that whether he was successful or not he wanted to be involved. [12:31 PM]: Random, older gentleman walks up to the table. My intuition said that he was from here in Miami. He was wearing a pressed blazer, and had an immaculate watch on. Our table had caught his attention because it said “Bitcoin.com”. This gentleman asked us, “Where can I get some Bitcoin? I want some Bitcoin and I do not know much about it.” We explained to him how he was in the right place, a Bitcoin Conference, and that on Bitcoin.com he could find exchanges listed where he can obtain Bitcoin from. [12:37 PM]: Lunch time… Chicken Fingers!!!!! [12:45 PM]: Get yelled at for not realizing that the Chicken Fingers were $2 per finger. [12:53 PM]: After waiting in line to pay, got to the front of the line. The credit card machine that the conference center was using did not work very well. It was taking a long time for people to pay. The woman working the cashier had to talk to two managers to figure out how to get the credit card machine to work. They tried to funnel everyone using cash to the front of the line. Being that this is at a Bitcoin Conference, it was truly hilarious to watch. Someone behind me in line said, “This is hilarious!” And ironic, too. [1:04 PM]: An information systems professor from Florida International University comes over to the Bitcoinist booth. He starts talking about how he conducts a lot of his research around Bitcoin, and has analyzed price movements and potential of the Blockchain. [1:06 PM]: Scott mentioned off-hand that he saw Nick Szabo speak at a conference in Las Vegas recently. He said that Nick was reserved and brilliant, and that his presentation was really cool. [1:15 PM]: Heading into panel on Media in Bitcoin. Caleb and Mate participating in the panel along with Pete Rizzo of CoinDesk. [1:19 PM]: Discussion around the centralization of Bitcoin mining. Discussion around the different large mining operations currently going on around the world. [1:20 PM]: Pete discusses how CoinDesk wants to bridge the gap between “corporate”/”traditional” companies and the bitcoin community. And that everyone, even the leaders of more “traditional” companies, have important ideas to contribute to the larger Bitcoin discussion. [1:21 PM]: Caleb says that the Bitcoin media sector has re-branded in the past 3 years, which I agree with. What previously was writing for just-bitcoiners, now is spanning towards a larger, tech-focused audience. Use of the term “Blockchain” is a means to make the FinTech community feel more welcomed. [1:24 PM]: Pete: we (the Bitcoin media sector) need less news; we need to focus on providing better quality news. If the bitcoin community doesn’t spend enough time to teach mainstream audiences the basics of bitcoin technology, Pete says, then it will be harmful for bitcoin in the long run. This is why there is so much misinformation (labeling bitcoin as “a failure”) being written now about the block size debate. [1:29 PM]: Mate makes point about how mainstream media still largely doesn’t understand Bitcoin. I agree with this, and feel that the entire community needs to continue to play a collective roll in educating people about bitcoin and blockchains. Mate’s example; “When there’s a server outage at a prominent site, it is not written that ‘the internet is dead’.” [1:36 PM]: Pete: If you have something that’s an actual story, that’s creative and that goes beyond simply reporting, then this will be read. This is not “content.” This is a way to produce great and engaging ideas, ones that will build the brand of that website. [1:38 PM]: Caleb: A lot of people in the media industry are hoping that micro-transactions and tipping will replace advertising. This, as Pete later pointed out, is a very difficult behavior to begin to induce in most people as they are then paying for something that they used to receive for free. [1:42 PM]: Pete: the industry is still in its early stages. The fact that institutions like banks are testing out blockchain technology is a great sign, but also demonstrate how far we collectively have to go. [1:44 PM]: Pete: it’s up to the leaders in the space to create new technologies, to create new news that is inherently story-worthy. [1:46 PM]: Pete: the bitcoin media sector has been very active in reaching out to, educating, engaging, and answering questions for more “traditional” companies. Scott says that bitcoin media companies do indeed field requests for information about bitcoin from “mainstream” media companies and larger companies, and quite often, too. [1:51 PM]: Mate: the primary goal of Bitcoin media companies is to provide a healthy forum for discussion, to enable people and ideas to meet one another. [1:56 PM]: Person in audience suggests micro-tipping for commenting sections of the site. Crowd really likes this idea, because they collectively dislike “trolls” in the comments section. Caleb points out how ZapChain and CoinJournal are already trying this out. [1:57 PM]: Person in audience explains how newer users to Bitcoin and newer people to the Bitcoin community are often turned away, because they do not understand the basics of Bitcoin. Most people, as he puts it, have not gotten to “Step 1” in understanding Bitcoin. He made a great point that for the other 7 billion people on earth, it’s really difficult to get and internalize this new technology. This received applause from the audience. This person ended on the question; “what’s the one message that you as bitcoin media companies would have for everyone? [1:58 PM]: Mate says that he thinks it’s too difficult to distill this into one sentence; points out how Bitcoin.com recently posted a 50-reasons to use Bitcoin post. Furthermore, Pete says that he feels that it is dangerous to take any one position here; he feels that media companies have a responsibility to view technology agnostically. Lastly, Caleb says that “bitcoin will do for money what the internet did for knowledge.” [2:26 PM]: Finally found a charger to plug in my laptop and phone. I’ve been juggling like 3 things at once. Been overhearing a conversation between an investor and an entrepreneur pitching to him at an isolated table in a conference room next to where my charger is. Investor at one point says “everyday our clients are dealing with law enforcement. Everyday. And it is a major question of how to take the risks within, how to approach the risks that they’re taking… I work with law enforcement all the time.” [2:29 PM]: See a model posing in a bikini next to a bitcoin vending machine. She was out of place; a conference of nerds didn’t necessitate models. I felt bad for her; that someone was subjecting her to do this, at a bitcoin conference. Then someone from the conference center yelled at her to put her dress back on. [2:40 PM]: Spoke to the team at Bitso, the largest Mexican bitcoin exchange. Learned that some of their users are freelancers, and that the CEO used to be a freelancer himself. Discussed the bitcoin community in Mexico; was told it is smaller than that in America, and about 1-2 years behind in terms of its size and momentum. But that it is indeed there and it is a community that’s growing. We also discussed bitcoin media aimed at serving the Spanish speaking bitcoin community, a likely-underserved demographic. The 3 publications that were mentioned around this were El Bitcoin, Sobre Bitcoin, and NotiBitcoins. [2:51 PM]: Spoke to the team at Clef, an application for getting around having to remember your passwords. Clef provides an interface which allows users to login without a password. This is done by scanning a QR-like code and signing off on the login with the actual-user’s private key. The team at Clef is great; I genuinely got along with them. We discussed the theoretical possibilities of blockchains allowing for fully decentralized identity verification. We discussed the block size debate and how bitcoin is software. I took one of their “Fuck Passwords” stickers. [3:18 PM]: Bumped into Edwin of the College Cryptocurrency Network, a friend of mine who I knew from the bitcoin community at the University of Michigan. We both talked to the team from Clef some more, then caught up off to the side. Edwin told me how CCN switched its name to BEN (Blockchain Education Network). I told Edwin that as a CS Major and college sophomore he should be hustling hard here, meeting people, promoting himself, and looking for new opportunities. [3:31 PM]: Waited to speak to Patrick Byrne one-on-one. Patrick was very friendly, a great listener, and was respectful to what I had to say. Patrick gave good advice about how to push forward difficult ideas. He recommended working hand-in-hand with the legal community. He also spoke positively of the potential for smart contracts. [3:53 PM]: Sitting in a separate room off to the side again, charging my computer. Patrick Byrne walks in with a group of entrepreneurs and sits down at the table next to me and starts talking as part of a podcast. Discusses the realities of fiat money with the entrepreneurs. Discusses China and negative interest rates. Discusses how transparency in the Federal Reserve through a blockchain can, theoretically, be a means towards creating a freer society. Discusses the benefits of being an entrepreneur. Be your own boss and self-actualize, Patrick says. “View yourself as mankind’s public servant,” he says. Off to a talk featuring Bobby Lee (CEO of BTC China) now. Podcast with Patrick is still going on next to me. [4:12 PM]: Bobby Lee’s talk actually hasn’t started yet (schedule is 10 minutes behind). Now in main auditorium at talk by Ledger CEO Eric Larcheveque. Eric discusses the potential and power of open source software. He discusses the advantages of hardware wallets, and how they’re more secure and people can relate to them better than digital wallets. [4:18 PM]: Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, enters the stage. His talk is about to be on the potential for Bitcoin to function as a (global) reserve currency. Makes analogy to currency being like a house. [4:22 PM]: Bobby defines money as a “Store of Value” and also having qualities including “stable, recognizable, rare, hard to counterfeit, hard to obtain, and it has to have a stable supply.” [4:23 PM]: Bobby defines what a currency is; simply a legal classification or definition. He details how many people in the media confuse references to “money” and “currency.” Speaks to how gold was originally not backed by anything, and that this was okay, because gold was essentially all they had once “currency” was first starting off. [4:28 PM]: Reserve currency is needed to give people confidence, Bobby says. Bobby views the idea of a “reserve currency” as an anchor, one which helps people not be too concerned about the fact that we use fiat money. The reserve currency is a counter-weight. Bobby: “Today, Gold is still the Reserve Currency, but Central Banks won’t openly admit that.” [4:30 PM]: Bobby says that Bitcoin “is real money.” And that “We have now invented a digital form of the perfect money. And now, because of that, it (Bitcoin) is suitable for the future world of digital reserve currencies.” [4:36 PM]: Next up, Brennen Byrne, CEO of Clef, gives talk making analogy of a CIA classified document from the 1950’s to the Hackathon Hacker’s ethos of today. [4:41 PM]: Brennen: “If you look carefully in your logs, you will see that basic attacks like this will happen all the time”. Discusses how hackers scan for opportunity and then look for justification later. [4:44 PM]: Brennen: Botnets, SQLi, DDoS cannons, Phone calls and emails to support are all main forms of attacks. [4:45 PM]: Security tips from Brennen: Do not reinvent the wheel! Follow industry best practices. Use concentric circles of defense. [4:48 PM]: Brain is hurting. Feeling tired. Should probably get some water soon or take a nap. Brennan’s talk just ended. One talk to go. [4:50 PM]: Final talk of the day, by Patrick Deegan, starts. Patrick is the CTO of Personal Blackbox, a company putting forth solutions for decentralized identity and trust. [4:55 PM]: Patrick: Distributed ledger technology can serve as the DNA of our identity and being online. Blockchains allow for this all to happen in a decentralized manner. [4:57 PM]: Patrick: We need to create something that makes it easy for our grandparents to use and manage private keys. This is key, Patrick says. I agree with this wholeheartedly. Evening [5:02 PM]: Really tired at this point. Getting sidetracked. See article on Facebook titled “Feminist Frequency takes on ‘strategic butt coverings’ in video games.” [5:03 PM]: Slide during Patrick’s presentation catches my eye. It makes a point about Smart Contracts. It says; “Smart Contracts: autonomous and secure execution of governance, legally binding alternative dispute resolution, Rule of Law.” [5:06 PM]: Patrick’s talk is over, going to get some water. [5:14 PM]: Didn’t actually go to get water. Stayed to hear the Q&A with Patrick. Someone in audience asks about Homomorphic Encryption. [5:18 PM]: Conference is declared officially over for the day by the host. Off to actually-get-that-water now. I hope that everyone has enjoyed following along in today’s post. Bitcoin conferences, as you can see above, are fun, nerdy, and intertwined places for entrepreneurs to meet. They’re a great place to learn in general and also learn about new opportunities. I’d recommend going to one if you haven’t yet. Be on the lookout for a day 2 recap tomorrow evening!
bitcoinist	tim-bitcoin-2016-new-years-toasts	Cheers, Tim: Bitcoin's Stellar 2016 Means New Year's Toasts For All	2016-12-31T08:00	At the end of Bitcoin’s rags-to-riches year, it’s hard to think of a bigger industry winner than Tim Draper – the ‘Warren Buffett’ of Bitcoin. An $18 Million HODL The venture capitalist, who purchased just shy of 32,000BTC at two US government auctions in 2014, is now sitting on a Bitcoin fortune of around $31 million. Compare that to the wholesale price he paid at the time – even during an uptick to $650, the haul ‘only’ cost Draper $18 million. Bitcoin’s current (almost) unprecedented highs have taken the investor’s net worth well north of $1 billion, leaving other Bitcoin celebrities like Roger Ver firmly in the shade. Buffett meanwhile had an equally encouraging year, finishing 2016 an extra $12.3 billion richer, with a total net worth of almost $75 billion – enough to make him the world’s second richest man. Bitcoin Comes of Age in 2016 If Buffett’s figures seem daunting, however, it should not detract from the run that Bitcoin has had – and continues to have – over the past year. Starting out from a modest $428 per coin at the start of January, Bitcoin is currently trading at over double that – around $950 – and more in some places. In fact, the still relatively unknown and often misunderstood cryptocurrency outperformed the Dow Jones 124% to 14% in 2016, the Wall Street Journal reports. It is interesting to reflect back on which events caused ups and downs in price in 2016, and how these were not at all foreseen. The mining reward halving in July, as well as the release of Segregated Witness block size solution in April, did little to alter the cost of a coin, despite the constant heated debates which seemed to engulf the entire community. In fact, it was geopolitical factors that really saw knock-on effects in the Bitcoin price. This is because as Bitcoin has matured, it has become a genuinely useful tool to hedge against major events. A prime example of this was the UK’s ‘out’ result in its EU referendum June 24. After the results were in and markets retreated in horror, Bitcoin appreciated in value by as much as $140 in a single day in some markets. Thanks, Fiat! While Donald Trump’s election victory produced more muted results, the switch in Bitcoin’s characteristics is evident compared to previous years. Only hacking could have more profound effects, and these came true in July when Bitfinex was relieved of almost 120,000 BTC, sending the price per coin plummeting 20%. But it wasn’t to matter for long. Despite Bitfinex customers getting a 36% financial haircut and nine other exchanges falling prey to cybercriminals, the state of various countries’ fiat economy decisions later this year was enough to send citizens across the world flooding into Bitcoin. Bitcoinist wishes our readers, Tim Draper, and Warren Buffett a Happy New Year. What do you think were Bitcoin’s highlights of 2016? Let us know in the comments below!

Here's How Saifu Could Help - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-26T14:00	As a crypto investor, do you often find it very hard to keep track of your many coins and investments? Wouldn’t you like a way to see all your holdings easily, and buy and sell different coins with the click of a button? Here’s how Saifu could help. Saifu – Taking Cryptocurrencies Mainstream Wallets, private keys, accounts, addresses; most of us have gone through all that before. Securing and keeping track of all of our crypto holdings can seem daunting at times. Setting up different wallets for different coins can be exhausting even for the veterans in the field – having to download and install a new piece of software every time you make a new investment isn’t exactly convenient. Fortunately, a new service called Saifu could change this. Saifu makes using cryptocurrencies together with regular currencies accessible, easy and secure for a wide audience of non-tech savvy people and businesses. For those that are familiar with online banking, Saifu will seem no different; it is an online and mobile banking platform that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without going through any hassle of setting up wallets. However, Saifu isn’t limited to just that – users will also have the ability to open IBAN bank accounts for both traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. They will also be able to issue debit cards linked to cryptocurrencies for their customers; a very handy feature, considering that most bitcoin debit cards were shut down a few weeks ago. Your Coins are Safe with Saifu Instead of forcing users to secure their coins using cold storage and hardware wallets, Saifu makes the process much simpler for the end user. Saifu uses a combination of hardware and software technologies to deliver multi-layered security to protect each customer’s account. They have partnered with Thales – the world leader in banking security technologies – to secure customers’ funds. Each account has an access key that is stored within the Thales Hardware Security Module, meaning that it cannot be stolen by hackers. Saifu is also a fully regulated financial institution, so there is little to no risk of them collapsing in a fashion similar to Mt Gox. Their day-to-day operations are frequently audited by one of the world’s largest accountancy firms, and they are fully compliant with regulators by adhering to strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. Saifu Token Initial Coin Offering Launched on January 15, 2018, the Saifu Token Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is currently ongoing and will continue through March 11, 2018. Saifu hopes to use this ICO as a means to raise funds for marketing and operational development to grow their business. The token plays a vital part in the platform, seeing as all transaction fees and exchange fees will be paid in Saifu Tokens, creating a natural demand for them. The tokens will also act as an incentive for users to participate in the Saifu loyalty program, which will reward users based on the amount of Saifu Tokens they hold in their account. Bitcoinist has just learned that, in addition to the loyalty program, users of the platform will receive a discount for making payments using the Saifu tokens in their account. The initial coin offering is currently being held at a rate of 0.0001 BTC per token. Trading of the token is expected to commence within a few weeks, if not days, of the conclusion of the ICO. For more information about Saifu, please visit ico.saifu.ai and download the project whitepaper. What do you think of Saifu’s concept? How do you currently keep track of multiple cryptocurrency investments? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Saifu
bitcoinist	tnabc-2016-coverage-day-two	TNABC 2016 Coverage: Day 2 - Bitcoinist.net	2016-01-22T20:49	This piece was written by Ryan Strauss Hello again! Checking in here from TNABC Day 2 in Miami. It was a lot of fun writing yesterday. I’m going to try and keep the style the same today; honest, open reporting about what’s actually being discussed here at a Bitcoin conference. There’s a lot more going on here than you may think! While the media often turns their attention to huge shows like DevCon and ComicCon, these Bitcoin conferences fly relatively under the radar. Also read: The North American Bitcoin Conference 2016: Day 1 TNABC Day Two: Getting Started How are there only ~300 people here? Surely, there are more people in the world who could benefit from attending a Bitcoin conference, who want to go and who have valuable ideas to contribute. I am hoping that this recap today entertains, provokes thought, and also encourages you to attend a Bitcoin Conference in the future. This is the best place to actually learn about Bitcoin: In person. Sit back and relax. Here we go. Morning [8:10 AM]: Wake up to the third of many snooze alarms going off. We had intended to wake up at 7:45 AM. Oh well. [8:11 AM]: Stumble over to Sanna. Tell him to wake up. Am going off of literally 1.75 hours of sleep after I was up very late last night writing my “In Defense of Greek Life” post for my blogging campaign (#100DaysOfBlogging) on Medium ( follow me on Medium! @ryanstr ). [8:15 AM]: Nothing better than a shower in the morning to wake you up. This has literally been one of the busiest, craziest weeks of my life (was co-best man for a wedding in Chicago last weekend, too). [8:47 AM]: Finally get into Sanna’s car. It’s raining heavily in greater Miami. Respond to multiple Facebook Messenger messages. Head downtown. [9:10 AM]: Get dropped off by Sanna somewhere near 12 th street and 3 rd avenue. It was somewhere not far from Brickel. Yes, the streets here in Miami actually are grid-intertwined with “Avenues” on one side and “Streets” on the other. This was very confusing. Thought through how a blockchain could help remedy some of the problems presented here around naming streets, identifying houses, identifying who owns what and where that property is. [9:11 AM]: Saw a turf soccer field surrounded by a fence next to a busy intersection where I was dropped off. Got really excited by this. Took a picture of it. Wondered why they don’t have something like this in Ann Arbor, particularly that spot right next to Lorch Hall. Start walking towards the James L. Knight Convention Center. [9:14 AM]: A large bus passes by in the rain. I start thinking about how cool it would be if a city like Miami started accepting Bitcoin on all their public transportation systems. This requires software upgrades and integration with the blockchain. Guessed in that moment that this may not happen in Miami until 2026. [9:15 AM]: Saw parking meters not being used and slanted over in a decrepit manner. Thought how Bitcoin and a blockchain could alleviate the problems of knowing where to park, having to run out to your car to put more money in the parking meter, and of having to drive and park your car in the cold (in Chicago). [9:20 AM]: Noticed how low the gas prices were. What effect does this have on the price of Bitcoin? [9:39 AM]: Sitting outside of Capital Grille in Brickel, marveling at the luxurious nature and grandeur of all the swanky high rises which surrounded me. Watched as the bridge opened across the river/channel that divides the convention center from where the Capital Grille is in Brickel. [9:46 AM]: People waiting for the boat bridge to close, so that they can walk across, are getting impatient. One man tries to start biking across the bridge even though the gates to access the bridge are still closed. This gave me a flashback to the time when I was in San Diego last month and witnessed someone try and climb under the train outside of the convention center where ComicCon is held. This person nearly died, as the train started up with an intensely loud screech just as this person was crawling under the train. [9:52 AM]: Arrive at Day 2 of TNABC. Right now, it’s a lot less crowded than yesterday. [10:00 AM]: Speak with Julio of Bitcoin.com about tips to improve my writing. Discuss how Bitcoin.com is different than Bitcoinist.net. [10:16 AM]: Mate offers to buy me a bagel and cream cheese. I reluctantly accept this generous gesture. Bagels… For free. 0 satoshis spent. #HelllllYeah! [11:55 AM]: FINALLY am done with my “In Defense of Greek Life” post on Medium. I initially wrote this out here as “In Defense of Bitcoin.” That is now a post for another day. For today, time to get back to Bitcoin and TNABC, Day 2. Afternoon [12:07 PM]: Start talking with the team at BitMain. Get into a deep discussion about Bitcoin Mining. Get to see an up-close look of what an actual bitcoin miner looks like. This was no communal mirage, like what happened in 2013. This was a multitude of miners, sitting right in front of me, right before my eyes. [12:14 PM]: Start talking to Hayden Gill about bitcoin mining. We unearthed some amazing insights that I had not previously internalized. This made Jordan Birnholtz’s “Bitcoin is a donut” blog post from March 2013 make that much more sense. We discussed trends in mining currently; how the mining difficulty has risen by so much since September 2015, and how this was also around the same time that the Bitcoin price started rising again. We discussed how bitcoin mining is at the core of Bitcoin, at its heart. Without these seemingly useless computers, there would be no Bitcoin, no accountability or trust over the web without having to rely on centralized institutions, no TNABC. Mining is the culmination of 40+ years of computer science research. It is the physical manifestation of both the Bitcoin software and Bitcoin itself. Miners are crucial, they are insanely important to the future of Bitcoin. [12:25 PM]: Hayden and I still talking here. We discussed how the United States Dollar equivalent value per day generated by Bitcoin miners confirming transactions from blocks remains essentially the same, all the time. Whether the price of Bitcoin is at $100, $200, $400, or $2,000, either way the price will create an incentive that will either attract miners or it will not. The electricity costs involved in running a Bitcoin mining operation are now huge! Therefore, depending on the price of Bitcoin, individuals will be tempted differently to either turn their miners on or not. Similarly, only some people went west in the 1840’s, during the Gold Rush, which was based out of San Francisco. [12:26 PM]: There are certainly parallels to Bitcoin with this analogy here, too. Because of this, the difficulty of Bitcoin adjusts to the decisions made by individuals as to whether or not they want to use their miners. With this, there is a tradeoff; mine or not mine? Increase the difficulty and lower the amount you receive in raw-bitcoin per day by mining more (which will also drive up the price), or lower the difficulty on the network by not-mining, therefore increasing the amount in raw-bitcoin you’ll receive when you do solve a block (and the subsequent lowering of difficulty will also help lower the USD/BTC exchange rate). This is a really difficult tradeoff to internalize; it took me about 3.5 years of following Bitcoin closely until I really got it. Until I spoke with Hayden at TNABC, Day 2, in Miami, Florida. It took me 3.5 years to really realize that the USD equivalent value per day generated by miners remains relatively constant. For this reason, bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game; the profits for mining operations in the long run will trend towards zero as the market becomes more and more saturated and competitive* (*as the difficulty increases, oddly, which is a paradox, too). [12:39 PM]: See Marco Santori walk by out of the corner of my eye. Only knew that this was him because Hayden said so. [12:40 PM]: Learn that large bitcoin mining operations are starting to find creative ways to form partnerships with energy companies to leverage inefficiencies in the electrical grid. They do this because it is actually mutually beneficial for both the mining companies and the energy companies. At night, energy companies often have to power down large parts of their power grid, which is costly, takes time, and is simply inefficient. Now, to address this, bitcoin mining operations are using this electricity to mine, which it seems lower the costs associated with the power grid. This is a symbiotic and mutually beneficial relationship, one which provides miners with cheaper electricity, encourages the running of more full nodes, and also does not put as much stress on the grid from turning it on and off. On and off. On and off. The cost of electricity is one primary reason why the price of oil does indeed impact Bitcoin’s price (which is a Spectacle, a distraction from the underlying aforementioned realities about Bitcoin Miners). [12:50 PM]: Lunch time. Bump into Tone Vays in line. [12:51 PM]: Get a tuna sandwich for lunch with chips. Talk to the friendly woman working the cashier. Joke with her asking if other people here have been joking about how the conference center in Miami does not accept Bitcoin. She was not amused, and just smiled instead. [1:40 PM]: Heading into Bitcoin related panels now. [1:47 PM]: I lied. Just spent 7 minutes of bliss jamming to @BroJoeDroJoe. Now heading into the big room with the Bitcoin related panels. [1:56 PM]: I lied, again. Spoke with Mia Molnar of Genesis Mining. Learned that she is organizing a music event in Munich. Reached an interesting insight about differences in music culture between Europe and America. Thought to myself how cool it would be if a smart contract controlled the possibility to reward bitcoin to a crowd or a musical artist based off of the sound patterns present and crowd noise. Felt excited that LivelyGig is helping to make this a reality. Mia also handed me a “paper wallet,” which at a Bitcoin Conference is hilarious and an amazing marketing tool. [2:10 PM]: Finally actually-in the big auditorium with the panels. The gentleman speaking, Jerry Brito of Coin Center, made a comment that around how any attempt to regulate Bitcoin technology is futile; the cat is already out of the bag. The technology of trustless distributed systems is already out there. If we want to talk about “regulating” Bitcoin, then we need to do this in the context of regulating Bitcoin as a currency, which is fundamentally different than regulating Bitcoin/blockchains as a technology. [2:13 PM]: Jerry: “The U.S. is the leader when it comes to regulation.” The US issued the first guidance on how a regulation applies to Bitcoin, in 2013. And the Bitlicense was the first measure passed of its kind anywhere in the world. The US is a leader in the regulatory community on many issues, so it would make sense to see it here. [2:16 PM]: Jerry: The Bank Secrecy Act is a crucial act in the history of the United States of America. It is a law that requires information about all parties involved to be obtained from any country in the world. This are known as AML checks, Know-Your-Customer (KYC), and Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR). In enforcing this law, OFAC (Office of Foreign Asset Controls) has a legal responsibility to identify the identity of all parties involved. This law was designed for a world of wire transactions, not Bitcoin. Using Bitcoin, which is inherently-semi-secretive, poses challenges to identifying the information of and location of the parties involved. Our approach when regulating Bitcoin companies is often, in ways, like trying to fit a peg into a round hole. [2:21 PM]: Jerry: Consumer Protection is a very important area for the Bitcoin community to work hand-in-hand with the legal community to make progress on. Right now, for almost every form of investment, consumers are protected. This earns these associated forms of investment respect among the legal community and increased usage among more mainstream users more largely. [2:23 PM]: Jerry: Right now, the attempts to regulate this take place on the state level. This is a hangover from a previous era of financial infrastructure. It is difficult to require each and every Bitcoin company to obtain a monetary transmission license from each and every state that they want to legally operate in. Often, these state level licenses are costly to obtain and require knowing lawyers and also meeting a minimum capital requirement threshold. [2:25 PM]: Jerry: Engaging regulators and getting regulation to come out with new and favorable laws to Bitcoin more quickly will only help the Bitcoin Industry. This is why it is important to be nice to lawmakers and to be honest with them. There needs to be a mutual understanding of how the technology at hand works in order to craft mutually beneficial regulation, which will meet the needs of both government, consumer protection, and entrepreneurs (who often currently operate under grey areas, and this often discourages action too). [2:28 PM]: Jerry: Multi-Sig, the ability to give control to multiple parties at once, is a fundamentally new concept in IP and Property Law. [2:29 PM]: Jerry: The Bitcoin community making friends with the legal community, being honest and genuine with them, needs to happen now. This will help protect Bitcoin in the event of a Black Swan event. This is what Coin Center does. [2:32 PM]: Talk ends around a discussion over the ethics of “money laundering.” Jerry made it clear and the crowd acknowledged that money laundering is, in all cases, illegal. Someone in audience asks Jerry why he is not fighting to change this. Jerry made a brilliant point, that I 100% agree with; money laundering is illegal and will always continue to be illegal. It is for our collective safety, and it makes sense. Rather than trying to fight against this reality, the Bitcoin community should embrace it and form partnerships and have insightful discussions with regulators. [2:38 PM]: Talk by Josh Dykgraaf, Freelance Art Director, on Bitcoin Branding begins. As Josh put it, “The (Bitcoin) logo should instill the confidence and perceived security of a bank… The logo needs to appeal to both developers and soccer moms equally.” Right now this clearly is not the case. [2:51 PM]: Josh: Mastercard’s logo, two overlapping circles, is simple, technologically thought provoking, and ignites feelings around security and trust within us. It instills confidence in users due to the trust that people have in the brand. An attempt in 2010 to change their logo failed. [2:53 PM]: Josh: “Mass adoption will be much easier if Bitcoin has the right Branding.” [2:54 PM]: Talk by Jason King, founder of Sean’s Outpost and Unsung.org. Jason has recently ran across America, from Miami to San Francisco, to help raise awareness around and money for the homeless population. [2:55 PM]: Jason: “This is my third time here. Moe [Levin] puts on the best conferences in the space.” [2:56 PM]: Our country throws away millions of pounds of food per year. To address this, Jason has created a sharing-economy based application to share “excess” food and help feed the homeless. [2:58 PM]: Jason: Often times, restaurant owners have to pay to throw away their own food. They have to pay a specialized professional to pick it up and throw it away. This, additionally, is also costly because the restaurant paid for the food too. [3:00 PM]: Jason: “Our tagline here is ‘Hack Hunger’.” This received a loud applause from the audience. Jason said that they are helping to game-ify the space by showing leaderboards which in turn put form a social pressure on others to donate their excess food to those who are hungry. [3:04 PM]: Bitcoin Regulation Panel now starting. Marco Santori, who I walked by earlier, is now on stage with Jerry Brito and Veronica McGregor. [3:27 PM]: Marco: “Bitcoin is only perceived as a good tool for money laundering. It is not actually a good tool for money laundering.” [3:33 PM]: Marco: “Remember when we used to call this ‘Bitcoin 2.0’, not ‘Blockchain technology’?” [3:50 PM]: Marshall Long, CTO of Final Hash, now is speaking. “Mining is not supposed to be a profits game. It is supposed to be a zero sum game.” These words, this realization, really resonated with me, as I first came to this realization earlier today. “Whoever creates the best chicken shed for miners wins the game, right now.” [3:51 PM]: Marshall: In China, mining companies can obtain subsidized electricity through the local government. [3:52 PM]: Marshall: Development in mining chips has advanced quickly of late. This, in my personal opinion, has been a huge factor in the recent difficulty increase and subsequent price rise over the past 5 months. [3:53 PM]: Marshall: Bitcoin mining technology is running into the problems of Moore’s Law. Evening [4:29 PM]: I just posted my “In Defense of Greek Life” blog post from Medium (@ryanstr) on Hackathon Hackers. Comments already streaming in. [4:42 PM]: Paying attention to TNABC, Day 2 again now. Feels good to finally be done with that blog post. [4:45 PM]: The current and also final speaker, Dean, is the President of the Blockchain Education Network (BEN), which was formerly known as College Crypto-currency Network (CCN). I watched CCN start at the University of Michigan. It was really cool seeing it transform from an idea to “Michigan Bitcoiners” in Ann Arbor to CCN being featured in the Wall Street Journal. [4:46 PM]: Dean: “Our generation will change the world.” [4:48 PM]: #GenerationBlockchain. This is the first time in my life that I have ever seen this hashtag used. I love it. [4:49 PM]: Dean: All modern and new financial applications must be global. Given the behavior of young people, this is the only form of financial possibility that is in-alignment with the way that they are used to sharing information (and money is a form of information, too). [4:57 PM]: Moe Levin now for closing remarks. [4:57 PM]: Moe (paraphrased): We are now ready for a new form of currency that is in alignment with our heavy-travel-style lives. [4:58 PM]: Moe: “One of the aims of this conference was to set the direction for the coming year, and I think we have done that.” [4:59 PM]: “Bitcoin is on the bring of monumental change. We are that change. We are the future of this industry… We are the agents of that change. Thank you guys!” Thanks for reading our coverage of TNABC 2016!
bitcoinist	tokyo-crypto-exchange-bitflyer-approved-europe	Tokyo exchange BitFlyer approved for Europe	2018-01-23T02:00	Governments across the world are either opening their doors to crypto or closing them. Exchanges need to keep up with this fast-paced ecosystem and seek out friendly nations and markets. Japan is still a haven for crypto and Tokyo exchange BitFlyer has recently gained approval to operate in Europe. According to Coinmarketcap, BitFlyer is the world’s fourteenth largest exchange with a 24-hour volume in the region of $300 million. More significantly, it carries 80% of the Bitcoin trading volume in Japan which is one of the globe’s largest crypto markets. BitFlyer offers trading directly in fiat but only carries Bitcoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. The UK’s Daily Mail has reported this week that the exchange has been given the green light for a European launch. bitFlyer Launches in Europe and Becomes the World’s First Bitcoin Exchange to Be Regulated in Japan, the US and Europe https://t.co/GR1N6kZjRr — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) January 23, 2018 Branching Out The exchange has been granted a payment institution (PI) license from the Luxembourg regulator for the European Union, building on its regulatory approval in Japan. According to the report, BitFlyer is the only licensed exchange in Europe giving traders access to one of the world’s largest crypto markets – Japan. Founder and chief executive Yuzo Kano told media: When I set up BitFlyer in 2014, I did so with global ambitions and the belief that approved regulatory status is fundamental to the long-term future of Bitcoin and the virtual currency industry. I am proud that we are now the most compliant virtual currency exchange in the world; this coveted regulatory status gives our customers, our company and the virtual currency industry as a whole a very positive future outlook. An estimated 10 billion Euro ($12 billion) of Bitcoin is traded worldwide per month, which makes the currency the third largest Bitcoin market after the Japanese Yen and the US dollar. Exchange Expansion The move has been greeted with open arms by industry professionals and investors. Cedric Jeanson, CEO of BitSpread, one of the world’s largest digital currency market makers, said; We’re pleased to see BitFlyer landing in Europe. As virtual currency trading becomes mainstream and institutional investors get involved, there is a gap in Europe for a platform which specifically caters to the professional market. According to the FT BitFlyer will only offer trading of Bitcoin/Euro pairs but said it planned to support other virtual currencies such as Litecoin and Ethereum and more fiat currencies in the coming months. The move is a positive one during a month of negative news regarding crypto exchanges and general media FUD. Will Japanese exchanges in Europe bring in more investment? Share your thoughts below.

bitcoinist	top-venture-capitalist-says-cryptocurrencies-worth-trillions-dollars	Top Venture Capitalist Says Cryptocurrencies Could be Worth Trillions of Dollars - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-02T16:00	The total value of all cryptocurrencies currently sits at around $300 billion, but venture capitalist Albert Wenger believes that it could eventually be worth trillions of dollars. The economic, not to mention societal, impact of cryptocurrency cannot be denied. Individuals from across the globe are turning to decentralized digital currency for numerous reasons, such as investment, ease of transactions, anonymity, lack of bank access, or sheer need. It seems every new week brings a new high to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and the total value of all cryptocurrencies is now around $300 billion. However, one of the top venture capitalists, Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventures, says that cryptocurrencies could eventually be worth trillions of dollars. Is the Future of Cryptocurrency Rosy? At the Slush technology conference in Helsinki, Finland, Wenger made a number of remarks to CNBC. He said that there’s a lot of “irrational exuberance” in the cryptocurrency market right now (as seen by the recent dips and surges), but he believes that the total value of all the various digital currencies could go a lot higher in the future. He told CNBC that it’s too early to tell if digital currencies are in a bubble, and he added: So I believe there’s a good chance that cryptocurrencies taken together as a bucket will be worth trillions of dollars. We are a long way from that. Cryptocurrency Following in Amazon’s Footsteps? An interesting note made by Albert Wenger was his reference to Amazon when discussing the long-term prospects of cryptocurrency. He said: If you look at (the) Amazon stock chart, it looks like this massive upward sloping curve. But then if you zoom in you see in the beginning there was this very quick run up and then this big drop off. So the way I look at this (cryptocurrencies) is when we look back at it from far in the future, it will be a very massive run up. The current run up could turn out to be a blip on that chart. So I think it’s you know, once you reach the territory we are in today, there’s definitely a way for it to go down. And there’s definitely also a path in the future where, cryptocurrency as a whole will be worth trillions of dollars. Overall, this is an interesting perspective from a widely respected venture capitalist, and his Amazon reference could be spot-on. Albert Wenger was an angel investor to Etsy and Tumblr, and Union Square Ventures has invested in a number of blockchain startups. Wenger is not alone in being bullish on cryptocurrency. Ronnie Moas of Standpoint Research told CNBC he expects Bitcoin to be worth at least a trillion dollars in a few years. Hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz said that the market cap of cryptocurrency could be $2 trillion by the end of 2018. Of course, there are still the naysayers, like Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who believes that Bitcoin is a fraud. Do you agree with venture capitalist Albert Wenger that the market cap for cryptocurrency could one day be trillions of dollars? Or will digital currency eventually crash and burn? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Flickr, Pixabay, and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	trace-mayer-bitcoin-115k-2018	Trace Mayer: Bitcoin May Hit 'Significantly Overvalued' $115k in 2018	2018-01-18T08:30	Bitcoin Knowledge host and notorious advocate Trace Meyer has suggested Bitcoin could hit $115,000 in 2018 after its correction ends. Wall Street Money Mountain ‘Lining Up’ The latest in a cluster of buoyant forecasts for the Bitcoin price to surface in recent weeks, Meyer tipped fellow analyst Tone Vays for suggestions on what to expect over the next eleven-and-a-half months. $115,000, despite being a theoretical possibility based on previous behavioral cycles, would be “very overvalued,” Mayer adds. “Current (Bitcoin) run very similar to Jan-Mar 2013 run ($7->$266->$90; $700-$20k->$9k) with backlogged new accounts, etc. then Silk Road catalyst (salable supply shock) for $100->$1,200. Mountain of (Wall Street) money lining up,” he wrote in accompanying comments. Current #Bitcoin run very similar to Jan-Mar 2013 run ($7->$266->$90; $700-$20k->$9k) with backlogged new accounts, etc. then Silk Road catalyst (salable supply shock) for $100->$1,200. Mountain of #WallStreet money lining up. What are potential 2018 $BTC scenarios? @ToneVays ? 😎 pic.twitter.com/PqrinsGSFz — Trace Mayer (@TraceMayer) January 17, 2018 Bitcoin is currently recovering from a 48-hour slide which saw prices dip the most since 2013’s Mt. Gox implosion. Trading around $11,370 at press time, major exchanges had offered as little as $9402 per coin Wednesday, representing the lowest asks since late November. Tempering 2017’s Epic Bull Run Mayer’s optimism meanwhile partly echoes that shared by mainstream news outlet Business Insider earlier this month. On the topic of Wall Street participation moving Bitcoin markets, the publication suggested this week’s bonus allocation would result in a “buying spree” seeing cash flow into both Bitcoin and major altcoins. If that extra investment would “overvalue” Bitcoin, Mayer suggests that a “fair” value would lie anywhere between $9500 and $14,340 – meaning Thursday’s average exchange value in USD is the average traders should expect for the next year. Before this week’s downturn, Fundstrat investor Tom Lee had suggested a return to $20,000 in 2018, which if managed by June could result in a protracted move into new all-time highs. “So I think Bitcoin is still something you should own,” he told CNBC in comments January 9.

bitcoinist	trade-io-bringing-innovation-financial-sector	trade.io - Bringing Innovation to the Financial Sector - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-29T04:00	trade.io has a vision to revolutionize the financial industry, recognizing that in 2008 the world economy nearly collapsed, arguing that it was not due entirely to recklessness and a lack of transparency, but also because the financial sector had failed to keep up with innovation. The team behind trade.io sees that little has changed since 2008, nor have lessons been learned. Investors are at the mercy of high fees and low liquidity and, with transparency still lacking, even third-party verification suffers from conflicts of interest. trade.io aims to disrupt the current financial establishment and lead it forwards with honest and fair trading, conducted and recorded on the secure and transparent blockchain. trade.io’s one-of-a-kind trading and financing platform goes beyond cryptocurrency assets, also offering Forex and CFDs over precious metals, oil, commodities, indices, and global equities. At launch, they plan to feature more than 120 products on their platform. The Trade Token and ICO In order to facilitate a new trading platform, trade.io will introduce the Trade Token (TIO), a utility token that enables transactions of a wide range of assets, which also acts as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. One of the main benefits that trade.io will be offering investors is access to what they are calling the liquidity pool, where owners will be given the opportunity to contribute an amount of their stored assets to a P2P liquidity pool. From this pool, 50% of the daily revenue generated by trade.io will be paid to owners in the pool although a minimum of 2500 Trade Tokens will be required to qualify for this benefit. Trade.io will be issuing 500 million Trade Tokens, of which approximately two thirds will be made available for the crowdsale. Their ICO will run from the December 7th until the 4th of January 2018, and any unsold tokens will be destroyed at the end of the crowdsale. Allocation of the tokens will be in the following areas; 23% for acquisitions and IP’s, 20% for licenses, 20% for operations, 18% for the liquidity pool, 7% for development, 9% for seed and venture fund, 3% reserved for legal, audits and advisory purposes. trade.io has completed their pre-ICO successfully, raising over $11.3M from over 4,000 participants. According to icoscanner.io, trade.io is currently the 5th most successful ICO in Ethereum contributions. trade.io’s Experience and Partnerships trade.io’s team have over 20 years of experience in trading, investment banking, compliance and risk management. They have formed strategic partnerships with a number of companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces, including: Civic, whose technology will be used for identification and verification purposes; MODULAR, whose new Biosym framework decreases ICO processes by 85% on the Ethereum Network; HitBTC, the London based exchange has agreed to accept trade.io Trade Tokens. trade.io will announce shortly when the Trade Token (TIO) will start trading. TIO will have trading pairs with Bitcoin and Ethereum; Bancor, whose protocol will allow trade.io users to convert Trade Tokens (TIO) to any other ERC20 token. Paul Clarkson, CPO of HitBTC had the following to say: “It’s no secret that HitBTC is extremely selective in the tokens & coins we list, we have strict criteria and require an extensive amount of due diligence prior to extending an offer. trade.io has proven to be a trusted partner and we are pleased to list TIO, and start a long-term relationship.” As well as partnering with other high profile and innovative companies, trade.io also purchased the US regulated broker-dealer (BD) in an effort to focus on US regulatory compliance. William Heyn, trade.io’s VP of Capital Markets, explained: Being able to conduct trade.io’s business in the United States in a regulatory compliant manner is critical. The broker/dealer will afford us with tremendous opportunities and unlock many sources of revenue potential. One of the newest partnerships forged by trade.io is that with Bancor. By integrating the Bancor protocol with their own platform, trade.io users will be able to convert their TIO tokens to any other ERC20 token in the Bancor network at an automatically calculated price. Of the new partnership, trade.io CEO Jim Preissler commented: We continue to deliver to the trade.io community unique value-added propositions, and see this relationship with Bancor as a further example. We already have generated a large demand for our community and it’s only logical to provide a simple way to convert tokens. Investment in Education and the Future of Blockchain trade.io recently announced that they had funded two post-doctoral seats at the University of Nicosia with a specific focus on advanced research into Distributed Ledger Technology. Research will help develop and implement future updates regarding side-chains and cross-chain interoperability, as well as smart token corporate governance in an effort to develop best practices and implementations. Preissler spoke with Bitcoinist about the company’s educational support at the University of Nicosia: This is a major development for us, it provides trade.io with access to some of the brightest and most innovative minds in blockchain and digital currency. The University of Nicosia has embraced blockchain technology since 2013, they were the first university in the world to offer coursework and an accredited academic degree program in this field (MSc in Digital Currency) and are considered a global leader in academia in this area.

bitcoinist	tron-struggles-break-free-fud	Tron Struggles to Break Free From FUD - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-15T09:30	These are still very early days for crypto markets, and rising stars can fall just as quickly. Just ten days ago, one altcoin was looking to be the Next Big Thing, surging into the top ten and reaching the number six spot in the market capacity charts in a couple of days. Things can change quickly in crypto land, and a wave of social media FUD and PR blunders has brought Tron back down to earth. There can be fierce rivalry and loyalty over different virtual currencies on social media, and this can produce waves of sentiment that can actually influence the performance of a token, in addition to the presence of a few whales and the odd shill. Tron has seen this first hand as it has fallen from grace and out of favor for often fickle and inexperienced crypto traders. Pump and Dump TRX reached an all-time high of $0.28 on January 5th following a bucket load of publicity, a surge of 1700% since December 15th of last year. It has peaked and plummeted in the past month from $0.015 to its summit and then back again to $0.08, falling back a massive 70%. The USA Commerce cites this collapse to a number of PR blunders from the team at Tronix who are very active on Twitter. The first major setback for the cryptocurrency was the posts circulating on social media that the white paper had been somehow plagiarized. Founder Justin Sun has taken to Twitter to offer up an explanation in which he essentially blamed the translators for the problem by saying: Our original version of the whitepaper is in Chinese and we have a very detailed reference to the latest Chinese version. The English, Korea, Japanese and Spanish versions are translated by the volunteers. The translation missed numerous important details not just reference. Add to this the omission of South Korean exchanges from analytics website Coinmarketcap, and the price continued to decline. Newbie traders panicked and a selloff ensued. Partnership Promo Tron has announced a number of partnerships recently, but they seem to have been a little over-hyped. Sun has taken to the micro-blogging platform to extol the virtues of his platform by claiming access to millions of Chinese users through new partnerships, such as the one he called Chinese Netflix. The company, Baofeng, will be using Tron in their hardware division, which does not directly relate to millions of new users. According to a Medium post, the company has also hired tech experts from Alibaba, including Lucien Chen, who will head the team. There are also vague links with big investors, such as Feng Li, who apparently was one of the initial investors in Coinbase back in 2011. Tronix has recently announced applications for registration in Japan where it is hoped that the coin will be listed: We have officially filed the application to the financial regulators in Japan. Several Japanese exchanges will list us once the application is approved by the government. There have also been rumours circulating on Reddit of a Tron coin burn in the next couple of months. This should reduce the total overall supply, which is 100 billion, and make the token more appealing to investors. Considering this cryptocurrency has come from nothing to $0.10 in around six weeks, it is still an impressive feat despite the recent slide. However, in the fast-paced world of crypto trading, patience is a commodity in short supply, and those investing in Tron will need some to wait for those clouds of FUD to clear. [Disclaimer: the author of this article is a holder of Tron (TRX)]. Is Tron destined for greater things or will the token be gone by the end of the year? Add your comments below.

bitcoinist	two-big-four-accept-bitcoin	Two of the Big Four Accounting Firms Now Accept Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-02T21:30	In their quest to gain supremacy in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the Big Four accounting firms (Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG) are focusing their strategies and shaping their services to better respond to their customers’ demands. And, as a testament to Bitcoin’s status as an increasingly mainstream financial asset, PwC is following EY’s lead in accepting payments in Bitcoin. PwC Hong Kong Accepts Bitcoin Bitcoin and its blockchain technology are becoming so pervasive throughout business, finance, and industry that corporations, no matter how big or small, cannot avoid doing business that is, either directly or indirectly, related to Bitcoin and its technology. The Big Four accounting firms (Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG) affirm the cryptocurrency’s worthiness by embracing it and continuously adapting their services for new business models, such as crypto exchanges, crypto funds, and initial coin offerings (ICOs). For example, PwC offers its advisory services to help startups, financial, and technology companies to take advantage of Bitcoin’s blockchain technology. Consistent with this outlook, the PwC office in Hong Kong is now accepting payments in Bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal reported: PwC in Hong Kong said that it accepted the payment because it is increasingly working with startups in the city involved in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the open-ledger technology that processes bitcoin transactions by logging them on a public record. In a September 2015 paper entitled “Money is no object: Understanding the evolving cryptocurrency market,” PwC had already acknowledged that “Bitcoin has demonstrated its value.” The Wall Street Journal quotes Raymund Chao, chairman of PwC Asia-Pacific, who said: It is also an indication that bitcoin and other established cryptocurrencies have now developed into more broadly accepted forms of settlement. The Big Four Are Full Steam Ahead on Bitcoin’s Technology The other Big Four firms (Deloitte, EY, and KPMG) are also eager to keep up with the transformations driven by Bitcoin and its blockchain technology. For example, to promote Bitcoin’s adoption, EY made available ATMs at the World Web Forum for donations to Avatar Kids in January 2015. Subsequently, as of January 2017, EY became the first of the Big Four to accept Bitcoin for its services. According to an EY press release : EY is digitalizing itself – starting in 2017, it will be possible to pay invoices from EY Switzerland in Bitcoin, employees will receive a digital wallet, and a Bitcoin ATM will be put into operation in the main building. Deloitte also concurs with the belief that Bitcoin’s technology is creating amazing opportunities. Accordingly, a Deloitte article states: Although this electronic currency was originally viewed with quite some skepticism, the underlying technology is now being seen as an innovation that is creating a revolutionary range of opportunities. Bitcoin-friendly Deloitte has been actively involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for a long time. Moreover, a Deloitte report acknowledges Bitcoin’s virtues as a vehicle for payments, in spite of its volatility. Deloitte personnel are already making use of a BTM and paying for their meals with Bitcoin at Bistro 1858, both located in Deloitte’s Toronto office. KPMG is also providing advisory services related to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as blockchain solutions and ICOs. Recently, in November 2017, KPMG joined the Crypto Valley Association as a first partner. The Crypto Valley Association’s mission is “to take full advantage of Switzerland’s strengths to build the world’s leading blockchain and cryptographic technologies ecosystem.” Also, KPMG recently joined the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance (WSBA) as a corporate member. WSBA fosters the adoption of blockchain technology across financial markets. The Big Four group comprises the four largest providers in the world of audit, taxation, advisory, actuarial, management consulting, and corporate finance and legal services. They provide audit services to most of the public companies in the world, as well as many private companies. In fact, the Big Four offer auditing services to 99% of the FTSE 100 companies. Therefore, the involvement of the Big Four in the cryptocurrency industry is substantial evidence of Bitcoin’s significance in today’s corporate world. Do you think that the fact that the Big Four firms are accepting Bitcoin will accelerate Bitcoin’s rate of adoption? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	u-s-government-receives-approval-to-sell-bitcoin-seized-from-dark-web-dealer	U.S. Government Receives Approval to Sell Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Seized From Dark Web Dealer - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-07T22:00	The U.S. government has received approval from a judge in Utah to sell off 513 Bitcoin and 512 Bitcoin Cash seized from an investigation involving Aaron Michael Shamo, a dealer on the dark web. $10 Million in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash Seized The U.S government is preparing to liquidate all assets of Aaron Michael Shamo following his recent arrest, including his Ford pickup truck, BMW, and his nearly $10 million worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Shamo was arrested in November 2016 for allegedly selling counterfeit pharmaceuticals as well as using the US mail system to distribute his products. Shamo, along with other dark web operators Drew Wilson Crandall, Mario Anthony Noble, and Sean Michael Gygi, was found guilty on May 31, 2017 of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, aiding the importation of a controlled substance, intentional adulteration of drugs, use of the US mail in drug trafficking, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and engaging in monetary transaction in property derived from specified unlawful activity. The charges racked up by the conspirators carry a 10-year minimum sentence. Immediately following the verdict, the dark web operators’ holdings in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash were seized and transferred to the custody of the United States Marshals Service (USMS). The government expressed concerns over the cost of securely storing the seized currency for a long period of time, favoring the sale of the coins instead. “Here, there is a good cause for the sale because each of the following vehicles are accruing monthly payments pf storage and maintenance fees – which would total several hundred dollars a month for the vehicles – during the pendency of sentencing and forfeiture proceedings would significantly reduce the value received for these items.” The U.S. government must wait a period of 60 days before they may proceed with the sale, a period which will land in early 2018. Not U.S. Government’s First Crypto Sale In October, the U.S. government disclosed the sale of 144,336 bitcoins that they seized after shutting down the Silk Road. Officials cited concerns over the volatility of the currency and felt that it was likely to depreciate in value, prompting the government to sell off the coins. At the time of the 2014 sale, Bitcoin was valued at $336 per coin, making the total value of the seized coins more than $48 million. Had the government possessed itself in patience, however, and instead held onto those bitcoins, they would be worth $2.4 billion at current value. Large fluctuations in the price of the currency, as well as rocketing transaction fees, have caused officials to push for a prompt sale of the coins. The U.S. government intends to sell the 513 Bitcoins and 512 Bitcoin Cash in upcoming weeks at the current combined market value of approximately $9.9 million. Is the government selling at a good time or should they HODL? Tell us what you think of the pending sale in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay, Justice.gov
bitcoinist	ukraine-is-creating-official-group-for-cryptocurrency-regulation	Ukraine Is Creating Official Group for Cryptocurrency Regulation - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-14T23:30	The Ukranian government is planning to form a group that will oversee regulatory measures for cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges. Regulating Cryptocurrencies As cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular and widespread, many governments worldwide are introducing regulatory frameworks for digital currencies and exchanges. In 2017 the whole cryptocurrency market experienced an explosive growth rate which drew a lot of attention from governments and financial institutions. According to a recent statement by the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, the National Bank of Ukraine urged the government to implement proper regulatory measures for cryptocurrencies in Ukraine. The National Bank of Ukraine is mainly concerned by the fact that cryptocurrencies can be used for criminal activities like drug and weapons trafficking. The statement mentions that a working group will be launched, which will consist of representatives of the National Bank of Ukraine, Ministry of Finance and various other security agencies in order to create such a regulatory framework. The proposal would also give law agencies more access to websites and platforms that deal with cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Ukraine’s Own Cryptocurrency Many countries have already experimented with the idea of creating fiat-based cryptocurrencies. A couple of weeks ago EU officials denied the possibility that the Eurozone would introduce its own cryptocurrency. Russia and Venezuela already started experimenting with their own fiat-based cryptocurrencies. The statement by the NSDCU also mentions that the National Bank of Ukraine is considering to create its own cryptocurrency. Analysts believe that Ukraine’s own cryptocurrency would aim to curb the popularity of Bitcoin and altcoins in Ukraine and give authorities and regulators more financial control. The new regulations would also allow Ukranian authorities to properly tax any income that was archived through cryptocurrency trading, investing or mining. What are your thoughts on the regulatory proposal by the Ukranian authorities? Do you think that it will benefit cryptocurrency users in the country? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	ulterior-states-2015-film-review	Ulterior States (2015) Film Review - Bitcoinist.com	2015-07-03T14:00	[ezcol_1quarter]★★★/5 Director: Tomer Kantor Online, Documentary Running Time: 52 minutes [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_3quarter_end] At the moment, US politicians are lining up in droves to seek the coveted Presidential seat in the White House, and yet public faith in government institutions are at the lowest in decades. In an attempt to revive citizen participation, many candidates are slapping on new faces, new words, and new labels like ‘restore,’ ‘defend’ or ‘grassroots.’ But despite their tries to enfranchise a disenchanted public, they can’t hide the fact that politics hardly changes society more than a couple laws at a time and a couple new faces in a term, and especially in international economic turmoil that is still unraveling in Argentina, Greece, and the US Puerto Rico, people are not finding the serious political and economic answers they’re seeking. But something integral is seething at the heart of “ Ulterior States,” Tomer Kantor’s latest documentary. As a compilation of his interviews and videography over the past three years, what is so striking about this film is its almost pure kineticism in direction and concept. Full of latent energy, this film seriously stands uniquely apart from its contemporaries in the blockchain film space. To Kantor’s benefit, I think that’s the point. Where other filmmakers have been too cautious in their footing, he set his foot down. The film is radical in every sense of the word – it doesn’t toy around with definitions and who people are, but instead strikes deep into the philosophical underpinnings of blockchain technology, a topic treated with general trepidation in “ The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin ” (2014). Instead, Tomer Kantor is fearless, expressing a level of depth regarding the nature of the State, institutional injustice, power structures, and society. In his previous short film “ Bitcoin in Kenya,” Kantor was relentless as a documentarian, positing upfront that the hype of cryptocurrency potential in the African nation was mainly just that: hype. Instead of providing an easy listen, he poses a complex question about life in developing nations and the role of blockchain technology in a market dominated by a State-sponsored tech-sphere. It’s not simple, and it’s not shiny, but it reflects a visceral and intellectual understanding. In “ Ulterior States,” Kantor took a similar approach, acknowledging both the revolutionary implications of the blockchain as well as the near impossibility of a quick and painless political and monetary transition. It’s a complicated topic that he does justice. But that, in itself, is a caveat. Because the film is so patient, because the film is so intricate in execution, it finds itself to be a difficult piece for a global audience. It’s elusive in a way that is jarring and yet so dense; it’s certainly not introductory material. And yet, any audience can recognize and feel the sense of unavoidable uprising that is so pertinent and so pervasive to the discussion – be it the soft-spoken words of Andreas Antonopolous or the chilling footage of Aaron Swartz, something about this film is so irresistibly thought-provoking. It reminds us that the original intent of Bitcoin was not simply meant for an accumulative assimilation, but was an experiment meant to radically change the structure of State and society. The scope of the subject matter and the people involved carries an energy that is so present, yet so withheld. Kantor continues this tension by refusing to contextualize anything; no one has their name typed onto the screen, no geographical locations are expressly identified, even the interviews are shot with nondescript backgrounds, sometimes in front of a black curtain. It feels subversive and underground, covert inside the 1s and 0s of the internet, caught in a cultural revolution of information and technology that is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Indeed, we live in an ulterior state. What do you think of Ulterior States? Image: IAmSatoshi [/ezcol_3quarter_end]
bitcoinist	un-combating-climate-change-one-blockchain-time	The UN is Combating Climate Change One Block(chain) at a Time - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T20:00	We’re all aware of the versatility and usability of blockchain technology, and not just in the virtual currency industry. It can be used in nearly any industry relying on recording transactions and data, including the UN. The UN will soon be taking advantage of the power of blockchain in the fight against climate change. According to the EconoTimes, the group’s Climate Change secretariat has launched the Climate Chain Coalition (CCC), whose main aim will be to research how the technology can help in the fight against this global problem. The coalition currently has 32 members but will welcome more participants. It comprises of 25 organizations involved in researching and implementing distributed ledger technology (DLT). Massamba Thioye, who is leading the secretariat’s blockchain efforts, had this to say: The UN Climate Change secretariat recognizes the potential of blockchain technology to contribute to enhanced climate action and sustainability. UN Has Been Warming up to Blockchain for a While This isn’t the first time that the UN has expressed a keen interest in using blockchain technology to help combat climate change. A blog posted by the group in June 2017 discussed how the UN was aware of blockchain’s potential. Alexandre Gellert Paris, Associate Programme Officer at last year’s United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), previously said: As countries, regions, cities and businesses work to rapidly implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement, they need to make use of all innovative and cutting-edge technologies available. Blockchain could contribute to greater stakeholder involvement, transparency and engagement and help bring trust and further innovative solutions in the fight against climate change, leading to enhanced climate actions. The Benefits of Blockchain Blockchain would offer real-time data on greenhouse emissions and even the carbon footprint of certain industries. This data would be immutable, easier to monitor and would also result in more accurate reporting. The complete transparency that blockchain offers would foster trust among the parties involved, which could go a long way to improving the state of green finance, especially in developing countries. The CCC will follow a predetermined and agreed upon framework, which includes researching DLT and implementing pilot projects to further test its viability and success. However, as with any new venture, there is a level of trepidation and caution. Thioye added: To fully and promptly mobilize this potential, broad collaboration among stakeholders is needed to direct resources to priority areas, avoid duplication of effort, and help avoid the pitfalls of working on a new technology with countless unknowns.

bitcoinist	upcoming-cme-bitcoin-futures-may-draw-more-trading-volume	Upcoming CME Bitcoin Futures May Draw More Trading Volume - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-17T22:30	Since last week Bitcoin futures have officially started trading on CBOE Global Markets. Many Bitcoin investors are anticipating a rapid price movement once CME group launches its own Bitcoin futures contract this week. The Effects of Bitcoin Futures Bitcoin futures are currently one of the most popular topics in the Bitcoin and finance communities. In the last couple of weeks, many investors and traders were eagerly waiting for Bitcoin futures to officially start trading. Last week, the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) officially launched its own Bitcoin futures contract for trading. Most traders speculated that Bitcoin would drastically lose value, as rumors spread that many institutional investors would try to short the decentralized cryptocurrency. On the first day of trading, the futures surged by 20% and 4,000 contracts were exchanged in total, a relatively low trading volume since the average is more than 100,000. Experts believe that the main reason for that is the uncertainty that clouds Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Many institutional investors are still struggling to fully understand Bitcoin and its technology, and thus hesitate to invest in the digital currency. Upcoming CME Futures The Chicago Board Options Exchange isn’t the only entity that is launching a Bitcoin futures contract. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is also planning to launch Bitcoin futures in the upcoming week. Analysts believe that the CME will be able to bring in more trading volume and perhaps further influence the price of Bitcoin. In a recent Reuters article, Matt Osborne, chief investment officer of Altegris stated following regarding CME’s Bitcoin futures contract: The CME contract is based on a broader array of exchanges. So there is a possibility that the CME contract may generate more interest and more volume. It’s important to keep that in mind when (investors) are trying to make a decision. He also added: Volumes are going to slowly increase as professional traders get comfortable with the price action and more importantly get comfortable with the volatility and the margin usage, It will definitely be interesting to see how high CME’s trading volume will be. Traders are anticipating strong price movements once the futures officially start trading on the CME. Recently Bitcoin hit another all-time high price and is currently trying to stabilize at the $20,000 mark. What are your thoughts on CME’s upcoming Bitcoin futures? Do you think that CME will be able to attract more interest from investors and traders? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay, Pexels
bitcoinist	us-and-china-use-blockchain-to-trade-soybeans	US and China Use Blockchain to Trade Soybeans - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-23T17:30	A shipment of soybeans traveling from the US to China has become the first fully-fledged agricultural trade to utilize blockchain. Blockchain Continues Its Newfound Influence According to a report in The Business Times, the parties involved in the trade included Louis Dreyfus Co, Shandong Bohi Industry Co, ING, Societe Generale, and ABN Amro. The companies took advantage of blockchain to digitalize the sales contract, letter of credit, and certificates using the Easy Trading Connect (ETC) platform. Blockchain is a distributed record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet and first emerged with the introduction of Bitcoin. This is not the first time blockchain has been used to trade goods, as the technology has been successfully deployed to trade in other markets such as oil. Robert Serpollet, the global head of operations at Louis Dreyfus, expressed excitement about the trade stating, “We noticed very significant efficiency gains… far beyond what we expected.” Efficiency gains, he added, were a result of less time spent processing documents and data. Louis Dreyfus Co acted as the seller in the transaction, while Bohi acted as the buyer. The exchange also involved teams from both parties participating on the blockchain, while banks issued and confirmed the letter of credit. Russell Marine Group and Blue Water Shipping also contributed to the complex transaction by issuing all required certificates. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) gave counsel and provided insight on how to incorporate phyto-sanitary certificates in the process. Banks just put 60,000 tonnes of soybean on the blockchain https://t.co/459z8lj0RG — Jorge Sanchez (@JorgeSanchezIII) January 23, 2018 Officials Expect More Widespread Adoption The results include streamlining cost and overall time the transaction takes, a benefit for any business. Mr. van Vilet, a representative for ING, said, “This [cost saving] is key as we operate in a business that has high volumes and very low margins.” “If not months, then in a year or two max, I think the world in this space will look quite different,” he continued, alluding to the recent interest in blockchain and the potential the technology has for widespread adoption. News headlines have been teeming with stories involving financial institutions trying their hand at investing in cryptocurrencies and other projects, and it seems that we are getting closer to adopting the technology into our everyday lives. If businesses and this new technology are able to sync and work in harmony, the world will experience a new age of efficiency and be able to allocate resources more effectively. Will we see more companies begin to use blockchain in day-to-day transactions? Will more efficient practices benefit consumers as well? Let us know what you think in the comments!

bitcoinist	us-government-fears-bitcoin-will-be-the-next-swiss-bank-account	US Government Fears Bitcoin Will Be the Next “Swiss Bank Account” - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-12T18:30	Bitcoin’s explosive growth is dramatically disrupting the monetary and banking system to such an extent that banking and government authorities are sounding the alarm. In effect, the chief of the U.S. Treasury now fears that Bitcoin will become like a “Swiss Bank Account.” Bitcoin Defies the Banking System Bitcoin lets you have your private bank in your electronic wallet. As a result, Bitcoin will eventually render the fiat monetary and banking system obsolete. Hence, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s concerns might be justified. Now, Mnuchin is warning against Bitcoin becoming the next “Swiss bank account.” Sec. Mnuchin reports to #EconClubDC that @USTreasury is very focused on #cryptocurrency. His biggest concerns: making sure “bad people cannot use currencies for bad things,” as well as the speculation surrounding these currencies. — The Economic Club (@TheEconomicClub) January 12, 2018 For example, Mnuchin believes that anonymous financial transactions should be prevented. In this regard, according to Bloomberg, Mnuchin said: We can track those activities. The rest of the world doesn’t have that, so one of the things we will be working very closely with the G-20 is making sure that this doesn’t become the Swiss bank account. As Secretary of the Treasury, Mnuchin is the principal economic advisor to the U.S. President and plays a critical role in policy-making. His duties involve bringing an economic and government financial policy perspective to issues facing the U.S. government. Bloomberg reports that Steven Mnuchin said that he would work with the G20 countries “to prevent cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin from becoming the digital equivalent of an anonymous Swiss bank account.” The Economic Club of Washington, D.C. is the premier forum for elite global leaders to share their perceptions about significant issues of the day with top-tier business leaders. Mnuchin was sworn in as Secretary of the Treasury on February 13, 2017. Before his confirmation, Mnuchin was Finance Chairman for Donald Trump’ Donald Trump for President and Senior Economic Advisor to the President. As such, Mnuchin crafted Trump’s economic positions and economic speeches. Bitcoin Will be The Focus of the G20 Secretary Mnuchin is echoing his French counterpart. Indeed, the French government has already requested a debate about regulating Bitcoin at the upcoming G20 summit. The G20 will meet in Argentina this year. The G20 includes the governments and central bank chiefs of the world’s significant economies: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Union. On December 17, 2017, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire declared that he was going to ask the President of Argentina Mauricio Macri if G20 member countries could discuss regulating Bitcoin. According to Reuters, Le Maire said: There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how (…) with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin. As Bitcoin expands, bankers and governments will increasingly get worried and call for stricter regulations. However, Bitcoin will prevail and remain censorship-resistant. What do you think about the potential impact of the G20’s debate about how to regulate Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Reuters, The Economic Club of Washington, D.C.

Is the Bubble Ready to Burst? The cryptocurrency market had a phenomenal bull run this year. As the cryptocurrency industry is constantly improving and innovating, many finance experts believe that the hype behind it is just speculation. Experts believe that the global cryptocurrency market may be in a bubble state, and it might burst any moment. But many cryptocurrency experts are still optimistic and believe that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still undervalued. The Winklevoss twins recently stated that Bitcoin is still to undervalued. Global regulators have started warning investors from cryptocurrencies and potential fraudulent ICOs. SEC Warns Cryptocurrency Investors The US Security and Exchange Commision (SEC) has issued a new statement regarding its stance on cryptocurrencies and token sales. The SEC’s public announcement mainly focused on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. The announcement strongly advises investors to be more careful with their cryptocurrency investments, as the market is still unregulated and doesn’t offer the same securities as traditional investment markets offer. The report also noted that entrepreneurs that plan to host an ICO should implement the proper securities regulations by the SEC. SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, stated following in the report: Investors should understand that to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC. The SEC also has not to date approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies. [2] If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary. He also added: I believe that initial coin offerings – whether they represent offerings of securities or not – can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise funding, including for innovative projects. However, any such activity that involves an offering of securities must be accompanied by the important disclosures, processes and other investor protections that our securities laws require. A change in the structure of a securities offering does not change the fundamental point that when a security is being offered, our securities laws must be followed. [4] Said another way, replacing a traditional corporate interest recorded in a central ledger with an enterprise interest recorded through a blockchain entry on a distributed ledger may change the form of the transaction, but it does not change the substance. The SEC’s mains concerns are centered around fraudulent ICOs and token sales that promise unrealistic profits for investors. Recently, the special SEC cyber team managed to shut down a fraudulent token sale before it could start collecting money from unsuspecting investors. What are your thoughts on SEC’s new announcement? Do you think that new regulations would benefit the cryptocurrency space? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Pixabay, AdobeStock, Reuters
bitcoinist	us-treasury-warns-investors-venezuelas-petro-violate-sanctions	US Treasury Warns Investors: Venezuela's Petro Could Violate Sanctions - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-18T01:00	The US Treasury Department has cautioned investors that Venezuela’s Petro could be in violation of Washington-imposed financial sanctions. In December last year, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro announced that his government would be creating a digital currency, the Petro. In a country that is rapidly spiraling into a financial abyss, Maduro sees the state-controlled cryptocurrency as a sanction workaround and subsequently, a way to improve the country’s deep economic problems. During his annual message on the 15th of January, President Maduro stated: The center of financial policy will be the consolidation of the Petro. This cryptocurrency is the future of humanity. Venezuela has entered the future. However, the US Treasury Department doesn’t agree. According to Firstpost, the department cautioned a possible sanction violation through the usage of the digital currency. Coming up Short on Sanction Evasion Because of these sanctions, the country is unable to refinance its seemingly insurmountable mountain of debt. In addition, thanks to hyperinflation, Venezuela’s fiat currency, the bolivar, has dropped to record lows. A representative for the department previously told Reuters : The Petro digital currency would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government (and) could therefore expose US persons to legal risk. (It) is another attempt to prop up the Maduro regime, while further looting the resources of the Venezuelan people. Oil Backing a Concern This is a concern also shared by the country’s opposition Congress, who have stated that they will not recognize the Petro. They have also questioned the legality of the Petro as using oil to issue debt is unlawful. Maduro has said that each Petro will be backed by, and will cost the same as, one barrel of oil. In addition, he has said that 100 million petros will be issued soon with a subsequent value of approximately $6 billion. However, Maduro’s government has not detailed how and when investors will receive the actual oil. Venezuela’s Parliament: Maduro’s #Petro #Cryptocurrency ‘Illegal’ https://t.co/IdBNieHD2P pic.twitter.com/j4ZT5LGgUN — Bitcoinist.com (@bitcoinist) January 11, 2018 Discounted Private Petro Sale A document seen by Reuters shows that VIBE, a crypto advisory group working with the government, has proposed that Maduro first sell $2.3 billion worth of Petro privately, with a discount of up to 60%. The public would then be able to buy their share of $2.7 billion worth of Petro one month after the private sale. The remaining petros would be divided between the Venezuelan government and VIBE. The document went on to add that tax can be paid in petros and that PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, can use the crypto to help facilitate cross-border payments. VIBE also suggested that the Petro token be developed on the Ethereum network, a popular choice in the virtual currency industry. An anonymous source noted that the contents of the document have allegedly already been discussed by government officials. According to Maduro, exchanges would deal with both bolivars and cryptocurrencies when trading with the pre-mined petros. Do you think that these issues will put a dent in investor interest and contribution for the Petro? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Wikimedia Commons
bitcoinist	velix-id-partners-largest-cryptocurrency-exchanges-india-revamp-kyc	Velix.ID Partners with the Largest Cryptocurrency Exchanges in India to Revamp KYC - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-27T11:00	Velix.ID — a RegTech Blockchain startup, working in the Identity Verification Space — is partnering with Cryptocurrency Exchanges in India to improve upon the existing KYC processes. Initial cryptocurrency exchanges to confirm the partnership with Velix.ID are Coinsecure & Bitxoxo, two of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in India. On the partnership with Velix.ID, Mohit Kalra, the CEO of Coinsecure, said: The current process of KYC and identity verification is too troublesome and tedious for us as a Cryptocurrency Exchange and a cause of significant loss of business. I personally believe that with Blockchain Technology, this process can be improved upon drastically. When the idea of Velix.ID was presented to me, I was left impressed with the idea and the technical soundness of the execution plan. In fact, I wholeheartedly believe in —not just the idea— but the actual ability of the Velix.ID team to be able to execute this project successfully. The current procedures of KYC are a cause of major concern for both the cryptocurrency exchanges and their customers causing a significant business loss for the exchanges. There are multiple faults in the contemporary KYC methods that make the process of signing up on the exchanges very inefficient: Too time-consuming: It takes a least of 3 days to 5 days normally for an individual KYC process to be completed at the moment with any exchange. There are huge backlogs with many cryptocurrency exchanges because of the pending KYCs, which is causing huge business loss on daily basis for the exchanges. Loss in Customer Acquisition: The requirement to sign up with basic information, then make copies of your identity documents, uploading them, and then waiting for the verification process to be completed is a discouraging process for the Users, and incurs a loss in customer acquisitions for the businesses. The Velix.ID Solution: Revamping KYC The Velix.ID Ecosystem is a decentralized solution to the KYC problem. As a business partner, the exchange can simply request the verified identity of the User over the Velix.ID blockchain from a business/authority that has already verified it. This Verified-Identity Provider can be the User’s bank, another cryptocurrency exchange, or any other authentic organization from which the exchange is willing to obtain the identity from. This transaction is carried out in a secure, efficient, and private manner utilizing technologies such as Smart Contracts, Stellar Consensus Protocol, zSNARKs, HD Wallets (BIP32), and PoeT. This transaction of identity using Velix.ID is blazingly fast as the transaction is verified through multiple nodes on the Velix.ID blockchain, who are rewarded for these transactions. Velix.ID offers free verification stamps to the business partners so that they can test out the Velix.ID Ecosystem to see if their business costs improve with the Velix.ID improved KYC process. Other than the already secured partnerships with Coinsecure and Bitxoxo, Velix.ID is currently in talks with all major cryptocurrency exchanges in India for their KYC processes. The KYC process is, however, only one of the many use-cases of the Velix.ID Ecosystem in the Identity Verification space, which covers many industry verticals including cryptocurrency trading, real-estate, Travel & Hospitality, Banking & Insurance, Employment, Commerce, Transport. The Velix.ID Presale begins January 27, 11:59 PM UTC at 35% discount, you can register now.

bitcoinist	venezuela-now-requires-bitcoin-miners-register-government	Venezuela Now Requires Bitcoin Miners to Register with the Government - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-14T03:15	Bitcoin mining has exploded in Venezuela due to the country’s massive hyperinflation. Now the Venezuelan government is requiring bitcoin miners to join an online registry. It seems that the misery of the Venezuelan people knows no end. The South American country’s economy has been hammered by massive hyperinflation due to the policies of the authoritarian government, now headed by President Nicolas Maduro. Many people, both poor and rich, have turned to mining Bitcoin in order to survive. Now a further clampdown is coming as the Venezuelan government is requiring bitcoin miners to join an online registry. Sign Up … Or Else The announcement of the new registry was made at a recent press conference by Carlos Vargas, the newly appointed “superintendent of Venezuelan cryptocurrency.” Bitcoin miners will have to start registering with the government on December 22nd when the online registry goes live. Of the information that the government is looking for, Vargas says: We want to know who they are, we want to know where they are, we want to know what equipment they are using. Those in favor of the registry say that it will offer legal protections to bitcoin miners. Currently, the government has been cracking down on miners, such as the recent police raid on December 9th that saw the confiscation of 21 mining computers and the arrest of their 31-year-old owner. The police have charged the bitcoin miner with exchange fraud, computer crimes, damage to the national electric system, financing terrorism, and money laundering. (I’m surprised they didn’t throw in jaywalking while they were at it.) What Could Go Wrong? The people of Venezuela have been hammered by the socialist economic policies of the country’s last few administrations. Basic necessities, such as food and medical supplies, are non-existent, and inflation has reached over 4000% this year. Such circumstances have forced people to turn to Bitcoin in order to get the items they need to actually survive, and the situation is not getting any better. Weekly bitcoin trading in Venezuela has skyrocketed from $225,000 early in the year to a staggering $2.1 million in the first week of December. As soon as the people turned to bitcoin mining, extortion and theft by the authorities have happened. Many individuals have had their mining rigs confiscated by police and federal authorities, only to have those authorities use the machines to mine bitcoins for themselves. One miner recently gave up 11 of his 20 machines in lieu of a $20,000 bribe, and insult has been added to injury as the officials who stole his machines now contact him for technical advice. So, what could go wrong with an online registry for bitcoin miners? The most obvious is that the government will be able to do a mass confiscation once a full list has been compiled. The government of Venezuela has nationalized (forcibly taken over) hundreds of businesses, which has led to the vast majority of them failing. As David Fernando Lopez Torres, who moved his mining farm from Venezuela to San Francisco, notes: If I were still in Venezuela, there’s no way I would sign up. If they weren’t protecting miners’ rights without a registry, how can they trust that they would protect their rights with a registry? First they need to publicize what the registry will be used for, because we can’t trust their intentions. The likely result of the new online registry is that the majority of bitcoin miners will move even further underground. You would have to be stark-raving mad to believe that a corrupt government will honor any agreement to allow bitcoin miners to legally operate in peace. Either new taxes will be imposed upon the miners or the government will outright confiscate the equipment. Either way, the government will take the bounty of bitcoin mining for themselves. A dictatorial president, a national government who has seized hundreds of legal businesses, economic policies that have ravaged the country, and massive corruption all point to a really bad outcome for those who sign up for the registry. But at least Venezuela will have the Petro, their own national cryptocurrency! What do you think about the compulsory registry for bitcoin miners in Venezuela? Would you sign up? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay and Bitcoinist archives.
bitcoinist	venezuelas-parliament-maduros-petro-cryptocurrency-illegal	Venezuela’s Parliament: Maduro's Petro Cryptocurrency 'Illegal' - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-10T23:30	Venezuela’s president may have to put his Petro plans on hold as the country’s opposition party has outlawed the proposed state-controlled crypto. As decentralized cryptocurrencies continue to shine and grow in interest, certain governments are becoming aware of the benefits that virtual currencies have. Countries like Russia and Venezuela are reportedly aiming to introduce their own state-controlled cryptos soon, with latter seeming to make great progress in doing just that. In a bid to fight both hyperinflation and US-imposed sanctions, Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, recently announced that he would be developing the Petro, a national digital currency that would be backed by some of the country’s most precious natural resources, including oil. In fact, each Petro would be supported by one of five billion barrels of oil. To prove his intent, Maduro has ordered that 100 million petros, which cost a total of $5.9 billion, be issued. Not so Fast There Mr. President However, according to Reuters, Venezuela’s opposition-run congress has declared the Petro illegal. Legislator Jorge Millan made his thoughts on the matter quite clear: This is not a cryptocurrency, this is a forward sale of Venezuelan oil. It is tailor-made for corruption. The opposition parliament also hinted that Maduro would not be successful in his re-election efforts. Congress cautioned possible Petro investors that the currency would be worthless and nullified once the current president is no longer in office. In addition, because the development and planned issuance of the Petro were not approved by parliament, it essentially goes against the constitution. Maduro Dancing to His Own Tune Maduro has continuously ignored congress-imposed legislature since 2016 when his party lost control of said congress. This is not the first time the opposition parliament has opposed Maduro’s decisions. In July last year, the omnipotent Constituent Assembly was elected by the country, a vote which the opposition boycotted. At the time, the Trump-led administration defined the new legislative body as way to cement Maduro’s authoritarian regime. Based on this, the US imposed financial sanctions against Venezuela, making it near impossible for the country to refinance its looming debt. These sanctions have also resulted in extended payment delays between the country and its foreign suppliers, a problem that Maduro hopes the Petro can solve. Investor Caution According to crypto experts, investor support may be even more scarce due to Venezuela’s destructive economic history. In a country bursting with lucrative natural resources, the poverty level continues to rise. In addition, Maduro’s Socialist Party has an infamous reputation for blatantly disregarding privacy rights. Not really selling points for investors. There has been no comment from the country’s Information Ministry as yet, so it seems as if its full steam ahead for the Petro, and now it is just a waiting game to see if and when it will be issued. Do you think that the Petro will be successfully issued? If it is, will it help get Venezuela out of the financial hole that it finds itself in? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	vericoin-sms-wallet-dynamic-interest-and-much-more	VeriCoin: SMS Wallet, Dynamic Interest, and much more! - Bitcoinist.com	2014-06-08T05:26	Vericoin is a coin that has received much interest in the past few days due to many plans being teased by the developer Patrick Nosker. As I always say, an active developer, innovation, and a community is what you need for your coin to succeed. Fortunately, Vericoin has all three of these aspects. The coin’s developer Patrick Nosker is very active, and not only that, he is a gifted programmer with abilities some developers aren’t able to imagine of. Having someone as talented as Patrick, innovation is a given, and Patrick has teased many features that will be implemented in Vericoin, the one most teased being an SMS wallet. The first thing I asked myself when I saw all the SMS wallet hype. Why do we need an SMS wallet when we have smartphones? The answer popped up as quickly as the question was asked, not everyone has a smartphone, and it’s good for people to know that no matter your phone, you will be able to carry your Vericoin with you wherever you go. I can definitely see myself buying a 20 dollar phone to keep my Vericoin safe, but that’s just me. Whether its possible or not is yet to be seen, but I hope its possible. Diversity is very important, and the SMS wallet achieves just that. Hopefully, they are able to implement this wallet with many countries from the get-go. Photo posted by Patrick Nosker. Seems like a great cold wallet to me So, an SMS wallet isn’t capable of bringing a coin to the elite status right? Well, Vericoin is going to bring anonymity into play as well. Many false promises have been made regarding anonymity for coins, but it seems as if Vericoin might be the coin closest to achieving anonymity through what is being called Verisend. It will work through node mixing, and mixing of ring nodes. A very detailed whitepaper was released, and can be found here. The whitepaper goes in-depth on how anonymity will work with Verisend, and how effective it is as well. Another interesting feature of Vericoin is dynamic interest. Interest received through staking is higher if more people are holding and staking their coins. Therefore, the amount of coins would be higher or lower depending on the amount of people who hold their coins. Vericoin’s dynamic interest inflates the supply which in turn increases the network’s stability. To stabilize the way this inflation works, they have created the VeriFund which purchases liquid supply to have stable growth in the coin’s value. Another good thing about Vericoin that took place about a day ago is the integration of vericoin into Bter which will surely attract many bitcoin investors into the currency. Overall, the work being done by the Vericoin team is remarkable, and the developers are working to making the coin as innovative as possible. The coin has grown a lot in the past few days with an active developer and community. If all goes to plan, and the developers keep on improving the coin with their creativity, there is no doubt in my mind the coin will succeed. When we speak of coins such as Vericoin, value isn’t the most important thing. Innovation is key, and bringing such innovation into a real market used by all people is a great achievement. Vericoin has failed to disappoint, and I firmly believe it will keep on proving the naysayers wrong.
bitcoinist	vertcoin-asics-beware	Vertcoin: ASICs Beware! - Bitcoinist.com	2014-05-05T07:18	If you have heard of the ominous Titan from KNC capable of hashing at 300 mh/s on scrypt, or perhaps the gridseeds or any other scrypt asics, a algorithm that was designed to be anti-asic and you’re a miner, you are most likely searching for the next coin to mine. Take Vertcoin into consideration as that coin. Here are some Vertcoin coin specifications. Vetcoins has a 84 million Vertcoin max coin supply with block times of 2 and a half minutes, 50 coin block rewards, KGW difficulty adjustment to discourage multipools, and block halving every 4 years or so. But where it really shines is its algorithm. Vertcoin gets its anti-ASIC capabilities from its algorithm, known as Scrypt-Adaptive-Nfactor, which is not to be confused with Scrypt-Jane. This just means, that it runs on the same algorithm as Scrypt, but is able to change the Nfactor or memory requirement required to mine for Vertcoin. This is important for keeping ASICs out. Without going to much into technical details on how it bars out ASICS, it works basically like this. Imagine you had a machine that could play a game, start to finish in 10 seconds, but on easy. But what happens when you set the difficulty on normal? The ASIC, or machine in this case, no longer works. That is the approach Vertcoin is going with, upping the difficulty every year to discourage ASIC companies from developing ASICs for Vertcoin. This means for the miner that Vertcoin is a mineable cryptocurrency that you will be able to mine for a long time, if not forever; that is until all 84 million coins are mined. The Nfactor isn’t all rainbow’s and sunshine however. As Nfactor increases by one, memory requirements to hash double, effectively cutting your GPU’s hash rate in half. For the time being, GPU’s is still the fastest and most optimal way to mine Vertcoin currently, and will be for a long time. However as Nfactor increases, more memory will be required, making it more advantageous to mine with CPU’s, as they have access to large, variable amounts of RAM vs. GPU’s fixed amount, usually around 2 GBs, with most usually being 4 GB. Vertcoin is right now, even for its low price per coin; around $0.84 per coin, has considerable oomph market cap wise. Reason for this is a great community, being one of the largest cryptocurrency communities on reddit, and a fantastic developer with a emphasis on decentralization and anti-ASICS. As scrypt ASICS come more the norm, more miners will hop on to the “next coin”, which many believe to be Vertcoin therefore increasing value. So get in the scene while its early, and get ready to go vertical! Written By: Nigel Dollentas A.K.A. Precrime3
bitcoinist	volinex-offers-crypto-community-solution-major-debit-card-issue	Volinex Offers Crypto Community Solution for Major Debit Card Issue - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-26T18:00	BARCELONA, 25 January 2018 – On 14 January Switzerland based start-up Volinex AG launched its debit card to offer a solution for the sudden closedown of all W ave Crest issued Visa debit cards. The issue still causes major problems for millions of European cryptocurrency owners. For their debit card, Volinex is partnering up with a company that works with the largest credit card providers in Europe. At volinex.com people can place a pre-order for one of the 100,000 available Volinex Cryptocards. Up until this moment over 5,300 cards have been sold. Confidence The Volinex platform offers a wallet from which cryptocurrencies can be sold in euros and dollars based on the daily rates. From there the money can be loaded onto a debit card, and soon it will also be possible to put money on a linked IBAN account and make transfers directly from a crypto balance. Not only is Volinex working closely together in 2018 with their trusted partner, from 2019 onwards the company will also have its own banking license. This means third parties will never be able to block their cards. Money Laundering Act Volinex takes its responsibilities very seriously and therefore complies with the regulations as stated in the Money Laundering Act (MLA). This means that people who want to order a debit card will have to register under their real name, need to provide a copy from their passport or national ID card, a selfie with their ID card or passport, and a bill from the last three months. This verification is necessary to comply with the AML and to make sure the cards can be issued. Once the pre-order has been placed and paid for, Volinex sends an email to inform their clients when their debit card will be sent. Clients will receive their cryptocard by ordinary mail, and once received they need to verify their identity in order to activate the card. Prices The sudden end of the collaboration between WaveCrest and Visa caused very few active crypto cards to be available in Europe at the moment. Volinex decided to take quick action in order to solve this major debit card issue. The debit card which the company has released can be used for Bitcoins (BTC), Litecoins (LTC), Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and will be sold for €24.90. This includes manufacturing, shipping, and mailing. People can pay for the card in BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH. About Volinex On the Volinex platform, anyone can easily set up a free bank account with a linked Bitcoin Wallet, regardless of whether they are a private or business customer. With the Volinex software, clients can make a direct bank transfer with personal IBAN from their Bitcoin balance. This makes the manual transfer and sale of Bitcoins a thing of the past. Volinex makes crypto easy! Additionally, Volinex offers debit cards that can be topped up with the use of the online platform. The collaborating partners ensure that all legally relevant procedures, such as observance of the Money Laundering Act, the necessary licenses, and linkage to a FIAT-certified banking system are provided. Additional information about Volinex can be found on www.volinex.com, Facebook, Twitter, and our YouTube channel Volinex TV. Images courtesy of Volinex
bitcoinist	vootcoin-a-comeback-with-supporting-developers	VootCoin: A comeback with supporting developers - Bitcoinist.com	2014-06-25T04:59	Vootcoin had a rocky start as its developers had pretty much abandoned the coin. That is the first fact you should know about the coin. However, the community at bitcointalk was kind enough to show support and a developer was found to take over the coin. Currently, Vootcoin is doing some great things, showing what a community can do to save a coin from a devastating end. Having reached a low of 60 satoshis, and currently at 900 satoshis, it just comes to show that a good developer can change things around fairly quickly. General specifications of vootcoin include the use of the x11 algorithm as well as a total of 68 million coins in the proof of work phase. Vootcoin has knowingly shown some improvement since the day of its release with Nitesend soon to be implemented. Nitesend is a project I find to be quite nifty as its quite different from different methods of anonymity we have seen in the past weeks. Nitesend is an implementation of CoinJoin that aims to provide high levels of anonymity to Vootcoin. The whitepaper based on Nitesend can be found here, and it gives a great overview on how Nitesend’s system is going to work. There are two features I still want to discuss regarding VootCoin. The first one being SMS tipping which has suddenly become popular after VeriCoin implemented SMS tipping. The SMS tipping system for Vootcoin is in alpha testing at the moment, therefore, I don’t recommend using it just yet as there are some risks involved. You can see how the SMS system works here. I love this idea of SMS tipping as it opens cryptocurrency to the ordinary person while requiring as little preparation as possible. You may also wonder, why would I want to use SMS tipping when I can download the android wallet. The reason is that, believe it or not, not everyone has a smartphone, and its a great way of expanding cryptocurrency to those not heavily knowledgeable in the technological field in general. The last feature that is being worked on in VootCoin which I am looking foward to, and I hope is released is the VootMarket. Anonymity is going to be key in Vootcoin right? Why not introduce a open-source, decentralized market with anonymous peer-to-peer payments in which no central authority is present. Although I find it to be a great idea, and definitely innovative, the only concern I have would be government intervention such as the one we saw with the Silk Market. Even if it will be an open-source market, there has to be a way to counter the selling of drugs and such items. Personally, I believe the plans put in place by Vootcoin are certainly appealing, and even more so considering its troubled past which we should leave aside. I never tell anyone to buy a coin, and following on that, do research to gain in-depth knowledge on the coin, and make an informed decision. If VootCoin delivers on its promises though, it definitely will be a coin with a bright future.
bitcoinist	wall-of-coins-review-good-bitcoin-beginners-so-so-veterans	Wall of Coins Review: Good for Bitcoin Beginners, So-So for Veterans - Bitcoinist.com	2016-03-02T06:00	Wall of Coins is a peer to peer exchange for Bitcoin that advertises security and privacy as their primary features. Their service features zero transaction fees, a web API, and they boast 100% cold storage reserves. While their infrastructure for exchange is an interesting departure from both centralized and P2P exchanges, how practical and convenient is it compared to more sophisticated options like Circle and Mycelium? With a service that operates as uniquely as Wall of Coins, I think it necessary to evaluate where it fall in as a Bitcoin exchange solution. Read also: Linux Mint Backdoor Puts Users and Bitcoin Miners at Risk Let me start by stating that I use Circle and Mycelium as my standard solutions for the purchase and sale of Bitcoin. Both of these services have put a lot of thought into polishing their platforms, so your mileage may vary based on your exchange of choice, especially regarding user-friendliness. The aim of this review is to evaluate where Wall of Coins falls in the spectrum of Bitcoin exchanges and cover why (or why not) to give it a try, not to make direct comparisons to older, more mature solutions. However, analogous features will be pointed out where relevant. Ease Of Use Is Paramount The website proper is simple and inviting, with a no-nonsense interface and big, clearly labeled exchange functions. The design language harkens back to the pre-HTML5 internet, in the best way possible. The dynamic backgrounds, scrolling animations, and opaque site navigation that have become ubiquitous in new web startup splash pages is markedly absent, giving Wall of Coins a very professional aesthetic. Account creation is impermanent and not strictly necessary, and their 2-factor authentication system is refreshingly easy to use. The most convenient facet of their account system is that ID based verification isn’t required, which admittedly is a standard feature of most P2P exchanges. I used Wall of Coins for a few transactions to evaluate their system. Buying and selling Bitcoin is easy enough, and with a minimum transaction amount of $5, their system is pretty flexible compared to other P2P solutions, which depend on the sellers to set pricing and minimums. I’d say their system is perfect for those that are new to or only dabble in buying and selling Bitcoin, as it doesn’t have the ID verification barrier of traditional exchanges, and works around the proverbial craigslist murder-factor pretty well compared to older P2P solutions. There are a few quirks in their system that could put new users off, though. You have to drive to a bank to deposit your purchase directly into one of Wall of Coins’ accounts, to avoid transaction fees among other things. The other big hang-up is the rates you get on each purchase. On average they’re lower than traditional exchanges, and even most P2P exchanges if you put even a little work in (your mileage may vary based on your location and the state of the market.) This can be attributed to their smaller size compared to more established solutions, though. Bitcoin is released to your wallet quickly compared to central exchanges, taking around half an hour in my tests compared to a few days average on my solution of choice, despite Wall of Coins acting as a security intermediary. Selling Bitcoin is equally simple, though I wasn’t able to use it, as my bank is not supported by their website (I use a local credit union.) [EDIT: they do support Credit unions through the “co-op banking” option in the initial drop-down menu, as well as Western Union and Moneygram if you aren’t comfortable with providing bank info. While these options could be organized better in their interface, they are present. ] You can set your price per Bitcoin, the amount you want to sell, and even track your sale price dynamically to several popular exchanges. As Wall of coins handles the transactions between the buyer and vendor, this process feels a lot like selling on a traditional exchange, which is a significant step up from most P2P solutions. The difference is in ease of use. You simply go through a few drop down menus, deposit your Bitcoin, and wait. How fast your sale goes through depends on buyers, so be sure to price accordingly. Where Does Wall of Coins Fit in? The ease of use and low entry barriers inherent in Wall of Coins’ infrastructure make the exchange very newcomer and casual user-friendly. Wall of Coins also offers paper Bitcoin gifting via mail However, the exchange does have its flaws. While the 100% commitment to transparency and peer to peer exchange is posted prominently on their site, they act as an intermediary layer between Bitcoin buyers and sellers in the same way central exchanges do, so for security reasons, there will always be some necessary opacity in their system. This also brings a lot of drawbacks to their transaction system that P2P exchange users are looking to avoid in the first place. While their exchange has a substantial elegance and convenience not present in most P2P exchanges, the central authority that moderates the transaction system puts it in a strange middle ground between traditional and P2P exchanges. They have publicly auditable deposit addresses and a system that is markedly more private than traditional exchanges, but the way they solve the problems with older P2P exchange methods detracts from their decentralized nature. The layers between buyer and seller necessary to make their system work could understandably put off the more hardcore P2P Bitcoin adopters, and their simpler, more transparent exchange system may well drive away those looking for an “exchange as a service” experience. It’s difficult to place precisely where Wall of Coins falls within the range of exchanges. The market that best fits their services can be hard to place at first, too. They offer elegant solutions to problems pervasive in the P2P Bitcoin exchange ecosystem, and offer up far more info in the name of transparency compared to centralized exchanges, but fall short on the core features that each market seeks out because of it, making Wall of Coins decidedly a niche platform. However, they do what they do very well. Their offering is secure, private, easy to use, and refreshingly elegant. While I’d like to recommend Wall of Coins to everyone because of the positive experience I had using their exchange, they don’t offer an all in one platform for centralized exchange users, or a completely decentralized solution for fans of P2P exchange methods. If Traditional exchanges can be compared to commercial banks, and P2P exchanges to anonymous money orders, then Wall of coins would be close to a credit union. While I can’t say it’s a perfect solution for everyone, I think that it IS good for those new to Bitcoin. The simplicity and integration of traditional bank deposits make it easy for a casual user to buy Bitcoin without sacrificing privacy or trusting a faceless stranger, which breaks down the most common barriers to people on the fence about Bitcoin adoption. Wall of Coins’ exchange platform may not be what people want from a day to day Exchange platform, but it’s simplicity and robust design have obvious utility for many interested in Bitcoin, but don’t know where to get started. While that use case is the best fit for Wall of Coin at present, their strong foundation could easily take their exchange mainstream in either direction as they add features and polish to their platform. If you’re happy with your current exchange(s), then I see no reason to switch, as you’ll be sacrificing features or privacy depending on what camp you come from. If you want to introduce others to the Bitcoin ecosystem or are new to it yourself, though, Wall of Coins is certainly worth a look.

bitcoinist	wall-street-bonuses-bitcoin-spree	Wall Street Bonuses May Spark 'Crypto Buying Spree of Epic Proportions'	2018-01-09T08:30	Digital Currency Group director Meltem Demirors has forecast an “explosion” of buying across cryptocurrency as Wall Street bankers spend their bonuses. ‘A Buying Spree Of Epic Proportions’ January 15 Speaking to Business Insider late last week, Demirors echoed earlier tweets in which he expected a giant influx of cash from traditional investors with “cash a plenty to put into crypto.” “Get ready for an explosion,” she told the publication. Cryptocurrency markets are broadly down this week after the latest altcoin spike fizzled out and Ripple’s extraordinary growth revised downwards. Bitcoin’s market share remains at an all-time low, with Ripple attention in particular resulting in executives insinuating this week the largest cryptocurrency may not be the ultimate asset investors assume. As with the run-up to Bitcoin futures trading early December, Demirors suggests however that Wall Street cash could turn its price fortunes around once again. “When wall st bonuses hit bank accounts on January 15, i imagine we’ll see a crypto buying spree of epic proportions,” she added January 4. The comments received a warm reception on social media. when wall st bonuses hit bank accounts on January 15, i imagine we'll see a crypto buying spree of epic proportions. — Meltem Demirors (@Melt_Dem) January 3, 2018 Gold To Be ‘Vinyl Bitcoin’ In 2018 – Keiser A more sustained moonshot in Bitcoin meanwhile could have beneficial effects on beleaguered gold, Max Keiser forecast on the last episode of his Keiser Report December 30. Traditionally considered to have suffered from investors piling into Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency’s very success could see gold “hit $2300 or $2400 in 2018,” Keiser predicted. “Gold will be seen as an authentic version of Bitcoin, ironically enough,” he continued, “it’ll be the vinyl version of Bitcoin.” The millennial generation will be keen to amass and use gold as a result of “huge profits” from cryptocurrency. Keiser declined to give a Bitcoin price target for the forthcoming year, repeating an original prediction from several years previously when Bitcoin was worth $3, in which he eyed $100,000 per coin as a likely future value.

bitcoinist	warren-buffett-still-wont-admit-got-wrong-bitcoin	Warren Buffett Still Won't Admit He Got It Wrong On Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-10T17:00	The Oracle of Omaha just doubled down on his Bitcoin predictions, while openly admitting he’s got no idea what he’s talking about. Back in 2014, legendary investor Warren Buffett went on CNBC’s Squawk Box and claimed that Bitcoin was, “a mirage,” warning investors to stay away from bitcoin and, indeed, the cryptocurrency space as a whole. At the time, the digital currency was trading at around $600 per coin. Fast forward a few years (a little more, to be accurate) and the Oracle of Omaha is at it again. This time around, however, Bitcoin is trading at around $14,000, having only recently corrected from highs just shy of $20,000 in December 2017. From Buffett’s initial warning to Bitcoin’s all-time high, that’s a more than 3,200% appreciation. By comparison, some of Berkshire Hathaway’s (Buffett’s publicly traded investment vehicle) most prominent holdings – Coca-Cola, GEICO, etc. – have barely outperformed the major equities indices. Has Buffett Seen the Light? So what’s his latest take? In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box earlier today, Buffett once again had nothing but bad news for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investors. In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending. He added: When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know… If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it but I would never short a dime’s worth. In the options space, if you buy a “put” on something, you are wagering that it will decline in value between the time of purchase and the expiry. In saying he would but a five year put on all cryptocurrencies, then, Buffett is essentially saying he thinks that all coins will be down on current prices by the time the strike date comes around, five years from now. Of course, these sorts of options aren’t traded as relates to cryptocurrency assets right now (might we suggest that Buffett consider the futures market instead?), but the implications of his statement are clear nonetheless – possibly the world’s most well-known investor (and certainly the most respected and revered value investor in the world) still thinks that crypto is doomed. Is This The Right Guy To Ask, CNBC? Given his track record in this space, readers can be forgiven for taking what Buffett says with a pinch of salt. Indeed, he points out to the interviewer that he doesn’t actually know anything about cryptocurrency: Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don’t know anything about. As is becoming par for the course, however, this doesn’t stop CNBC from splashing his opinions as gospel headlines all over the internet. What do you think of Buffett’s opinions? Does it really matter? Will CNBC continue to lead with unqualified opinions in their cryptocurrency coverage? Let us know in the comments below!

bitcoinist	waves-ethereum-deloitte-igf-unite-self-regulate-icos	Crypto Platforms Unite to Self-Regulate ICOs - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-11T23:30	Regulation is one of the primary concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies at the moment. Pretty much anyone can set up a blockchain, put up a fancy looking website, add some slick looking team members, and tout their token as the next best thing since sliced bread. At the same time asking for your coin to support them. Open source blockchain platform Waves is addressing the issue by setting up an independent regulatory body which will provide reporting, legal, tax & accounting, KYC (identity verification), and business due diligence standards for the blockchain industry and ICOs. Swiss-Based The organization will be founded as an association based in Switzerland which was determined to be the most suitable location for an entity based on transparency and regulation. It will be open to all crypto exchanges and market leaders, blockchain and ICO platforms, marketing companies, professional service firms and reputable investors. According to reports, leading market platforms including Ethereum, Deloitte and the ICO Governance Foundation have pledged their support for the association. They will be working to coordinate on cross-platform ICO disclosure protocols. CEO and founder of Waves Platform, Alexander Ivanov, stated: Regulation is clearly an emerging phenomenon and concern in the crypto space. If certain jurisdictions have not yet announced their intentions, then it’s only a matter of time. Waves has always been clear that regulation – the right kind of regulation – is a good thing for the crypto space. We have also been clear that we want to be a part of that emerging dialogue. We want a seat at the table to be able to shape the future of regulation in the ICO and blockchain space. Ethereum On Board Ethereum’s Advisory Board member, Vladislav Martynov, had this to say on the initiative: Joint and voluntary initiatives such as this self-regulatory body for token sales are a critical element in the professionalization of the blockchain industry. As custodians of some of the most remarkable and disruptive technology ever created, we must be seen to be fostering its responsible use as well as building functionality and maintaining the security of the ecosystem. There will be a number of major functions that the association will be dealing with, and these include the creation of reporting guidelines for ICO projects, KYC/AML guidelines for ICO investors, business due diligence, and legal assessment. Waves will be registering the Swiss-based association over the next couple of months while creating its executive bodies and issuing proposed industry standards. Waves is currently trading at a three month high of just over $11, over double its November price of $5. Are blockchain platforms right to self-regulate or should it be left to governments?

bitcoinist	we-have-liftoff-bitcoin-rockets-past-3000-record-high	We Have Liftoff: Bitcoin Price Rockets Past $3000 Record High - Bitcoinist.com	2017-08-05T11:30	Bitcoin’s price reached historic new highs at $3230 late last night, while Bitcoin Cash settled below $300. Enthusiasm has finally picked back up amidst the volatility following August 1’s hard fork, and Bitcoin has a brand new price tag to show for it. Bitcoin shattered its previous record high of $3000 last night, while Bitcoin Cash took another haircut and has settled at around $285. The 3k price represents a notorious resistance level for Bitcoin, one which infamously ended BTC’s previous bull run in mid-June. BTC’s price had just barely grazed the 3k level before a massive sell-off sent it plummeting to around $2,500 in one of the currency’s largest single day losses. Since then, many have waited for Bitcoin to return to its previous highs as prices stubbornly hovered around the mid-2k range for much of June and July. Market volatility leading up to the August 1 UASF activation drove it down even further below $2000 before SegWit2x signaling finally restored prices to around $2600 in mid-July. BCH Down, Other Cryptos Up On the other hand, Bitcoin Cash (BCC/BCH) took another hit last night as BTC climbed. Although BCH launched at $200 and then skyrocketed to $1000 quickly after the fork, it has since been slowly losing value in its first six days of trading. It lost just over 20% value in the past 24 hours of trading. Many have already pointed out that BCH’s inflated price was a result of being unable to withdraw BCH funds from various wallets and exchanges, leading to low market liquidity. Once these issues were resolved and trading re-commenced, however, the price plummeted to around $400 and has since continued to dip. No one can move coins so the price is totally out of whack. A block hasn't been mined in over 12 hours. 😱 — elizabeth stark (@starkness) August 2, 2017 Regardless, it appears that things have been going well for traders who held on to both coins. Although many traders reaped large profits from selling off their BCH while prices were high, both coins’ combined value is now just under $3500. It remains to be seen if BCH’s price will dip further before stabilizing. Other cryptocurrencies are also faring well during this new boom. Ethereum is recovering previous losses and is now roughly $238. Litecoin shot up from $43 to $46 and is currently holding there. Ripple prices have also just recently spiked to $0.185, up from $0.175 last night. A Milestone for Bitcoin BTC’s new price marks a historic moment for users of the digital currency, who have waited with baited breath to see the outcome of August 1. Many have long awaited a resolution to the contentious scaling debates which have dogged the community for months. Although Bitcoin’s scaling issues are by no means over (there’s still the 2x part to implement in November), for now, users can breathe a collective sigh of relief that Bitcoin is now sailing in smoother waters. Do you think Bitcoin’s prices will stay above $3000? Did you hold both your BTC and BCH, or have you dumped either coin yet? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	whats-name-lots-cash-companies-rebrand-blockchain-profit	What's In A Name? A Lot Of Cash: Companies Rebrand 'Blockchain' Profit	2018-01-22T19:00	One of Blockchain’s more bizarre fringe benefits is still seeing huge success as companies make millions just for changing their name. (Company Name) + Blockchain = Bank The latest in a string of shrewd corporate moves to profit from the craze associated with the technology, UK company Stapleton Capital announced it had renamed itself to Blockchain Worldwide – making its share price jump 160% Monday. Previously trained on acquiring UK telecoms companies, its focus will now shift to Blockchain startups. While the temporary spike fizzled fast, Stapleton nonetheless pocketed an enduring 44% rise in a less than a day. In a statement repeated across mainstream media, chairman Jon Hale stated: We have seen a number of very exciting blockchain opportunities in recent months and believe the underlying technology has the potential to disrupt many industries around the world. […] This change in strategy, and name to change to reflect this, could generate significant shareholder value if we are able to acquire one or more of these fascinating nascent technologies. Magic Stock Money A testament to the magic effect Blockchain is having on investment, Hale is, in fact, rare among the Blockchain renamers to publicly link his company’s offering to an actual aspect of Blockchain technology. Similar moves, notably including Hong Kong tea manufacturer Ping Shan Tea Group’s name change to Blockchain Group Co., have been a lot more opaque. Ping Shan, for example, is yet to provide concrete plans for its Blockchain involvement beyond the updated description on its website. Companies in the US and Russia meanwhile followed suit in December, copying another UK firm, On-Line Plc, which in October became On-Line Blockchain Plc and benefitted from share rises approaching 600%. Experiments in Blockchain continue apace in January, with global giants keen to assess what impact the technology could have on their security, efficiency and, ultimately, balance sheet. Bitcoinist reported at the weekend how oil conglomerate Shell had purchased a stake in Applied Blockchain, in a move which is still shrouded in mystery. Chief technology officer Johan Krebbers told Reuters the investment was part of the company’s “commitment to use digitalization to create value in (its) core business and develop new business models.” What do you think about companies rebranding to Blockchain?

bitcoinist	will-icos-survive-sec-bloodbath	Will ICOs Survive the SEC Bloodbath? - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-17T14:45	The SEC just issued another warning over Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) but the test of a utility versus a security token is still murky. Here’s what I believe the 5 Actions the SEC will take against ICOs in the next 6 months. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton says, “I have yet to see an ICO that doesn’t have a sufficient number of hallmarks of a security.” Of course! But are you applying this standard fairly Mr. Clayton? Beanie Babies, baseball cards, and virtual goods in video games all have the same hallmarks of a security, but where are the regulations? The expectation of future profit? Check. Asset sellers promoting their future value? Check. A current product or service in a common enterprise? Check. Profits derived from the efforts of a third party? Maybe not. And therein lies the rub. I wanted to condemn the SEC for hypocrisy, but unlike other government bodies, found them exercising patience and reason. Referring to an SEC investigation report published this month Clayton discussed how to distinguish whether a token is a security: Specifically, we concluded that the token offering represented an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. By the way, that’s not new. The Supreme court stated nearly the same thing 71 years ago. But does a 71-year-old opinion still apply to today’s world? Golf Club Memberships and Crypto Kitties If you haven’t been following the CryptoKitties craze you’re missing an important Pokemon moment in the crypto community. Like Pokemon did for augmented reality last year, CryptoKitties have broken through an important threshold for cryptocurrencies. CryptoKitties is a game for breeding, collecting and selling digital cats for real currency. Think Beanie Babies that breed. Players of CryptoKitties have spent over $10 million on these digital felines and some sell for as much as $100,000. They meet all the “hallmarks of a security” so why hasn’t the SEC neutered them yet? Ostensibly the digital kitty owner takes “possession” of it, but not really. Axiom Zen, the site owner also has “possession” by setting the rules and control of the marketplace. So if Axiom is still providing a service to increase the value of the CryptoKitty, doesn’t that mean it’s an SEC violation? The situation is littered with contradictions. Still not getting it? Let’s look at something that SEC regulators and all the other fat cats on Capitol Hill can relate to: golf memberships. One of the charges the SEC laid on the now-defunct Munchee ICO was a claim that there was not an immediate use for the token. Back to golf memberships. A lot of golf memberships are sold to fund new golf courses and many of them are re-saleable prior to the golf course’s grand opening. Moreover, the membership owner neither has possession nor controls the golf course. So why is the SEC handicapped in this situation? 5 Actions the SEC Could Take Regarding ICOs These aren’t easy questions to answer but after reviewing several SEC documents and Mr. Clayton’s statements, I am going to lay out 5 actions I believe the SEC will take in the next 6 months. The SEC will accept ICOs as a legitimate fund-raising vehicle. I know there have been a lot of noise in the crypto community about shutting down legitimate ICOs, but I am confident this will not happen. Clayton’s comment on this reinforces my belief: It is possible to conduct an ICO without triggering the SEC’s registration requirements. For example, just as with a Regulation D exempt offering to raise capital for the manufacturing of a physical product, an initial coin offering that is a security can be structured so that it qualifies for an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. The SEC will shut down hundreds of past, current and future ICOs in one big sweep. In may not be a midnight raid, but I suspect they will send hundreds of cease and desist letters within the next 6 months. The SEC will develop an update to the Howey test to help guide future ICOs on whether they should be classified as a security or a utility token. Clayton recently hinted at this a few times and most recently: When advising clients, designing products and engaging in transactions, market participants and their advisers should thoughtfully consider our laws, regulations and guidance, as well as our principles-based securities law framework, which has served us well in the face of new developments for more than 80 years. I also encourage market participants and their advisers to engage with the SEC staff to aid in their analysis under the securities laws. The SEC will come down extremely hard on companies that are actively promoting the future value of utility tokens. Incidentally, if you’re thinking about doing an ICO, one way to protect yourself is to email the SEC staff at [email protected] and ask for guidance. The SEC will fine or shut down the worst offending platforms, brokers, and dealers and provide guidance to those that appear to be acting in good faith. Clayton warned about this action in his memo: Similarly, I also caution those who operate systems and platforms that effect or facilitate transactions in these products that they may be operating unregistered exchanges or broker-dealers that are in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Can the SEC Regulate Bitcoin? Cryptoassets' Legal Questions (Tentatively) Answered https://t.co/PwGpqwE9nF #CryptoRegulation #CryptoRuling — Crypto Ruling (@CryptoRuling) December 17, 2017 Summing It All Up So far, the SEC has played a measured and positive role in helping manage this complexity. What it should not do is constrain the actions of this developing market by being overzealous. Judging by Clayton’s opinions on the matter, it appears the SEC is supportive: We at the SEC are committed to promoting capital formation. The technology on which cryptocurrencies and ICOs are based may prove to be disruptive, transformative and efficiency enhancing. I am confident that developments in Fintech will help facilitate capital formation and provide promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike. In the final analysis, the SEC appears to be on board with change and they are stepping in to protect main street investors. ICOs are reaching a dangerous frenzy on the scale that we haven’t witnessed since the Dotcom Bubble, driven by inexperienced investors trying to make a quick buck. If the SEC provides clear guidance and drains out the “pump and dump” schemes, we’ll have a healthy, entrepreneurial alternative to Wall Street and venture capitalists. Note: Bitcoinist has reached out to the SEC for further comments, however, they have yet to respond. Do you think that the SEC will ever accept ICOs as a fund-raising vehicle? How will such acceptance impact the cryptocurrency market? Images courtesy of CryptoKitties, Pixabay, Reuters
bitcoinist	will-justice-served-bitcoin-trading-platform-bitconnect-sued-six-investors-lost-700k	Will Justice Be Served? Bitcoin Trading Platform BitConnect Sued by Six Investors Who Lost Over $700k - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-25T15:15	Six BitConnect investors, who collectively lost over $700k on the platform, are taking the company and its affiliates to court in the US. Earlier this month, BitConnect released this piece of so-called ‘System News’ on its website, outlining the fact that closing the Bitconnect lending and exchange platform. In line with the halt, the company reported that it would be moving forward with some key changes made to its platform, primarily rooted in the idea that BitConnect would serve as a wallet service and, at the same time, would news and educational services through its platform. At this time, we are closing the lending platform only. The BCC Exchange will work as usual and the wallet service will remain operational to hold your BCC on the website. @bitconnect @hitbtc @CoinExchangeio @livecoin_net @CoinMarketCap — BitConnect (@bitconnect) January 18, 2018 From its early days of operation, many suggested that the system that the company was operating was akin to a Ponzi scheme. The company’s offer of interest on holdings of BitConnect Coin, its proprietary token, while not guaranteed, still seemed too good to be true and the affiliate nature of the platform seemed to reinforce this suggestion. The latest news to hit press as relates to this saga is that a pool of alleged ‘victims’ – investors who claim to have lost between $15,000 and $200,000 individually through the company ending its operations – have sued BitConnect, filing a suit with a U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida. The suit, which is available here for anyone that wants to check out the allegations, outlines that BitConnect was offering up to 40% interest monthly on BitConnect Coin holdings and was promoting this through a variety of channels, luring unsuspecting investor capital. It goes on to highlight the fact that while the company promised to support the value of its token once it halted its lending operations, this promise was unsubstantiated because the token lost more than 90% of its value almost immediately subsequent to the news, wiping out the vast majority of the token’s holdings. Here’s a snippet taken from the Class Action Complaint section of the above linked to document: As the business’ closure in January 2018 revealed a Ponzi scheme, numerous securities laws violations, and thousands upon thousands of investors who lost [more than] 90 percent of their holdings. Interestingly, the suit also names some of the promotional channels and affiliates associated with the company as defendants in the suit, suggesting that the investors aren’t just seeking compensation from the core company but also from those who sought to lure them in through their various methods of promotional activity. There’s a good chance that this suit will pave the way for many like it given that while it is representative of more than $700,000 worth of losses across six investors, BitConnect Coin had a market capitalization of more than $2.5 billion at the time of its collapse.

bitcoinist	winklevoss-twins-hodl-billion-bitcoin	This is How The Winklevoss Twins 'Hodl' Their Billion in Bitcoin	2017-12-25T07:30	The Winklevoss twins have cut up and stored their Bitcoin keys in safety deposit boxes across multiple banks in the United States. One of the main problems with cryptocurrency is that thieves can plunder a person’s wallet, and there’s very little recourse that one can do in such a situation. To ensure that such an event doesn’t happen to their 120,000 bitcoins, the Winklevoss twins have cut up their Bitcoin keys into multiple pieces (on paper) and stored them in safety deposit boxes across multiple banks in the United States. Determination Pays Off One thing you can say about the Winklevoss twins is that they embrace determination. They spent years rowing in order to become Olympic athletes in the sport, which they did in 2008. After they were screwed by Mark Zuckerberg, they went to the mat and sued him, gaining $65 million in a settlement. They then used $11 million of that settlement to buy bitcoins, back when they cost less than $10 each. Most people laughed at them, but they were willing to go the long distance for the virtual currency. That wait has certainly paid off as Bitcoin has soared in value over the course of 2017. While it has dipped once again, the value of the bitcoins held by the twins is still well over a billion dollars. A great retort to all the naysayers who mocked the twins over their initial Bitcoin purchase, Tyler Winklevoss says : We’ve turned that laughter and ridicule into oxygen and wind at our back. Keeping the Coins Secure While the Wild West nature of crypto land can be exciting, it can also be dangerous as criminals hack exchanges to steal whatever they can get their hands on. The brothers are very keen on keeping their cryptocurrency safe, so they went to an extreme in order to do so. The printed out their various Bitcoin keys and then cut up the individual sheets of paper into pieces. They then put those pieces into different envelopes and mailed them to a number of bank safety deposit boxes spread throughout the United States. If a thief wants to get an entire key, they would have to pilfer every single safety deposit box in order to do so. Of course, us mere mortals can’t go to such extravagant lengths as the twins have done, but it’s a pretty good idea. What is most fascinating is that the Winklevoss brothers saw the writing on the wall early for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and they’re big believers. They operate the Gemini exchange and hold about $350 million more in virtual currency, with most of that total in Ethereum. As for the massive price spike in Bitcoin, the brothers have no intention on selling. Tyler Winklevoss says: We still think it is probably one of the best investments in the world and will be for the decades to come. And if it’s not, we’d rather live with disappointment than regret. What do you think about how the Winklevoss twins are keeping their Bitcoin keys secure? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Pixabay and Bitcoinist archives.

bitcoinist	xapo-reveals-fortified-military-bunker-storing-bitcoin	Xapo Reveals Fortified Military Bunker for Storing Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com	2017-11-25T19:30	Xapo, the company owned by Wences Casares, recently allowed a reporter to visit their secret ex-military bunker in the Swiss Alps where they store Bitcoin for important clients. There are times when the real world can be as surreal and fantastic as a movie. Case in point is the recent article written by Joon Ian Wong for Quartz and the World Economic Forum detailing his trip to a secret military bunker in the Swiss Alps. Is he visiting the bunker to view gold deposits? Priceless artwork? No, the answer is that the ex-military bunker is used by the Xapo company to store Bitcoin for their clients. A Base Worthy of a Bond Villain The location of the bunker is a secret, but it is placed within a granite mountain in the Swiss Alps. The bunker served as the Swiss army’s secret headquarters during the Cold War and was built in 1947. Now it is operated by the Deltalis company and is a 10,000 square-foot data-center that fills a space dug over 320 meters into the mountain itself. The bunker is used by Xapo to store private, cryptographic keys used to access wallets. The reporter was told by his guide that he has taken a number of clients with millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to tour the vault. Needless to say, such a site is a huge target for hackers and criminals, so the security precautions are off the hook. Good Luck Storming This Castle The security for this bunker is intense. Initially, the location of the bunker is a secret. The first barrier is a 10-foot gate, which is the lowest level of security one will find at the bunker. The bunker’s entrance is a foot deep of concrete, and visitors are photographed and fingerprinted after entering the lobby. Next, the person enters a “man trap” – a cylinder made of bullet-proof glass that shuts a person in until an operator opens the door on the opposite side, allowing deeper access into the bunker. Then there’s a set of steel revolving doors that require ID cards to pass through, which leads to a 100-meter long corridor. At the end of this corridor are two red steel doors that can survive a nuclear blast, and these doors are closed every night. The reporter was allowed to try to close one of the doors, but he couldn’t even budge it. But wait, there’s more! Next is the very secure, customized private suite used by Xapo, which was founded by Wences Casares, who is also known as “patient zero” of Bitcoin for Silicon Valley’s elites. Next is another “man trap” that leads to a white door. Behind the white door is a room the size of a closet and which contains a cooling unit and another door. Wences Casares The reporter was not allowed any further, but he was told that there were two more rooms past the closet-sized one. The first is the operator’s room, and the second is the “cold room” where the keys are kept. Nobody is allowed to enter the cold room, not even the operator. Its door is sealed with tape (like a crime scene). Now here’s the really cool part. The cold room contains hardware that is used to sign for Bitcoin transactions, but the hardware is never connected to the internet. The hardware is accessed by special cabling, and the actual transaction has to be approved by two more sign-offs, which are done by two other vaults that are located on separate continents. Yeah, you read that right. And there’s even more. To keep the keys secure from being wiped out, the cold room is enclosed by steel slabs to form a Faraday cage, which means an EMP attack will have no effect. Xapo maintains that such security precautions are absolutely necessary. The vault was designed to keep out hackers and terrorists, who routinely try to penetrate the vault’s defenses. As the head of security for Xapo told the reporter: We are under attack 24/7. This is not a race. It is a chess game. You have to think about the opponent’s next movement. You can never relax. Do you think such security precautions are necessary or are they overkill? How much would you love to tour this secret bunker? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	xcloudcoin-cloud-integration-within-a-coin	XCloudcoin: Cloud Integration within a coin - Bitcoinist.com	2014-08-04T08:07	XCloudcoin is an altcoin that integrates the cloud into cryptocurrency. Currently, the cloud feature is in a closed beta, and is mainly being given out to those who wish to review it. Therefore, I approached XCloudcoin, and they were kind enough to provide me with an invite. Other than this, XCloudcoin is also verified by CoinsSource with a trust rating of 6/7. It should be noted that the last point is given after a postage is sent that takes up to 2 weeks. You can find the whitepaper here. They have also integrated NiteSend, a unique feature used by SyncCoin. XCloudcoin is a fully PoS coin with an ICO at bittrex. The total coin amount used to be 5 million, but 3.85 million would be destroyed to bring the ICO amount to 1 million with a 150 thousand premine which has been used to pay for bounties. The main features by XCloudcoin are as follows: Cloud Storage Cloud Music Player Cloud Video Player News Feeds A Picture Gallery CryptTrader Charts Online Wallet Now, after using the cloud storage by XCloudcoin, I must say I’m quite impressed with it. It has a very nice UI with some nice built-in features. It has a nice news feed with latest news regarding cryptocurrency in general. Its online wallet is quite smooth, and is a great addition to their cloud system. The audio player impressed me as well. It was very smooth, and worked with all songs I had uploaded to the cloud. The cloud storage itself was decent. The reason I say this is because the maximum upload is 512 megabytes. Other than that, files were uploaded fairly quickly. A feature I found the most useful though, was the CryptTrader charts as they were very helpful to do some technical analysis on all coins. The truth is, XCloudcoin aims to be quite big in regards to their cloud system. It is functional, and has all that is needed to be successful. Features I appreciate the most are the addition of things such as the onlien wallet, charts, music players because they seperate this cloud storage from any other cloud storage. It kinda feels like the cloud storage for an altcoin with so many features unique to cryptocurrency. My experience was quite good using the cloud storage, and that is why I would recommend using it. To receive more space though, you will have to pay a fee in XCloudcoin which would stabilize itself according to the price. Personally, the cloud idea proposed by XCloudcoin is a great one. I love the idea, but whether it means a rise in value. That, I can’t be sure of. What’s true though, the coin has some great features, and their idea is an amazing one. Its use is there and it can’t be denied. Whether it means a value increase is unknown.
bitcoinist	xcurrency-a-serious-contender-for-the-2-0-crown	XCurrency: a serious contender for the 2.0 crown - Bitcoinist.com	2014-08-26T10:16	After my last article highlighting some of the anonymity players in the market was published I was asked (more than once) why in the world I neglected to mention blockchain 2.0 focused, strong anonymity player, XCurrency. My reasons for this are two fold in that 1) there is no way I could cover all the players in the anonymity market in a single article and 2) XCurrency seems to be much, much more than a simple “one trick pony”. So with that in mind let’s take a closer look at what exactly XCurrency has to offer and see if I can’t make some of my readers happy in the process. Ranked at #15 with a total market cap of 8,571 BTC ( 4,373,302 USD ) XCurrency is currently positioned high enough to feel confident about but not so high as to make you feel like you might be too late to the party. With BitsharesX rocketing up the charts lately, the market is certainly signaling that it is ready for fresh innovative blockchain 2.0 ideas and XCurrency seems like it just might be a serious contender to climb the ranks and challenge for the top spot. As I mentioned in my last article, anonymity will most reasonably be achieved by multiple layers of security. Something XCurrency achieves with gusto by using what it calls “Multipath Architecture” (a system that breaks transactions into smaller bits and pieces before sending them along different paths through the network) coupled with default end to end encryption, along with app encrypted keys… suffice to say this is one tough cookie to crack. However, it takes much more than robust anonymity protocols to be a real contender for the coveted 2.0 crown. In fact I would surmise that the time of single feature focused coins (that are basically Bitcoin + or – a few tweaks) are slowly slipping away to be replaced by more feature rich and dramatically different offerings. In this regard too, XCurrency does not disappoint. With development led by Boston based Dan Metcal f, XCurrency is still technically a DAC. Which is seemingly going to be a prerequisite of any legitimate 2.0 contender now and into the future but that fact, as with the anonymity issue, seems almost an afterthought when compared to the slew of features XC is proposing. For starters, they seem to have solved the blockchain bloat problem making the XC platform ideal for mobile devices.They are also planning to offer secure encrypted messaging/chatting, decentralized cloud storage, a payment network complete with NFC payment options, and the XC Stick which promises to deliver an added layer of security to your transactions. Now whether or not this multi-featured approach will be the key to market dominance remains to be seen but single focus coins (at least for the time being) seem to have been put on notice. While this exciting new market seems to thrive on experimentation; where strong ideas flourish and weaker ideas get dropped in a flash. The new hypothesis seems to be that it’s best to offer a robust, multi-layered, multi-faceted option that attempts to solve a myriad of problems (such as anonymity, blockchain bloat, mobile compatibility, and automated payment systems). Playing devils advocate one might suggest that such an approach runs the risk of spreading development resources too far and too wide. However, XCurrency seems to have a handle on that problem too by timing their development step by step, as seen on their short term roadmap. Whether or not XCurrency can fully execute that roadmap again is a question only time will answer. As of this week, they are up 14.29% and at the very least I would suspect they have the ability to fund their next stage (or two) of development. So while we cannot predict where they will be in 2 years, in the interim, we can reasonably expect them to be in the game. Perhaps even making gains on some of the seemingly stagnant offerings higher in the charts. As always the future belongs to anyone but in today’s hyper fast markets the future seems to be crashing into us headlong and I for one, am excited to see it arrive.

bitcoinist	youbit-bankruptcy-hackers-assets	Youbit Exchange Files For Bankruptcy As Hackers Wipe 17% Of Assets	2017-12-19T04:30	South Korean exchange Youbit has announced it is filing for bankruptcy after hackers stole 17% of its net assets. ‘Very Sorry (Again)’ In an announcement on its homepage since reported by various news outlets, the relatively unknown exchange, which is not to be confused with the similarly-named Yobit.net, said it had made “every effort” to stay afloat. A previous hack in April saw 4000 BTC covertly leave Youbit’s books, an episode from which the exchange never fully recovered. “I am very sorry to inform you again with the sad news,” the announcement reads. After the accident in April, we made every effort to strengthen security, recruit personnel, and reduce hot wallet storage… In the meantime, due to the hacking of our company at 4:35 in the morning, funds have been lost from your wallet. A Wild West Of North-South Korean Hackings The news comes amid increasing reports of malicious activity involving South Korean Bitcoin exchanges perpetrated by North Korean entities. Claims hackers have stolen millions of dollars in cryptocurrency over an extended period are circulating in the mainstream press, while even the South’s biggest exchange Bithumb has been left shaken by losses this year. Youbit has said it will go through a formal bankruptcy procedure to minimize customer fallout, but that balances would still auto-adjust to a fraction of their former worth, with the aim to refund once formal proceedings are over. “Through various measures such as the sale of cyber comprehensive insurance (3 billion [won]) and the operating rights of the company, the loss to members is expected to be lower than 17%… I will make every effort to minimize this,” the announcement continues. Only a day earlier, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith warned CNBC viewers that the time was ripe for another major hack in the Bitcoin space. “We see attacks and breaches about every six months – major breaches – so we’re probably due for one in the next month or two,” he told the network. What do you think about Youbit’s filing for bankruptcy? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock
bitcoinist	youtube-ads-hijacked-for-cryptocurrency-mining	YouTube Ads Hijacked for Cryptocurrency Mining - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-27T03:00	YouTube viewers are upset that their computers are being used for cryptocurrency mining due to YouTube ads being hijacked with Coinhive. While the value of cryptocurrencies continues to fluctuate, the desire for people to mine them hasn’t abated at all. In fact, many individuals look for additional ways to enhance their cryptocurrency mining. One option that many have turned to is the notorious Coinhive code that is often embedded in websites. Now it’s shown up in YouTube ads as users of the video streaming platform are complaining of having their computers used to mine crypto for some third party. Malicious Ads Take More Than Your Time Everyone who uses YouTube knows of their irritating ads. Most of them play before a video can be watched, but some will pop up in the middle of a streaming video. They’re an annoyance, but at least they only steal a few seconds of your time. That changed for a short time when a number of YouTube ads were hijacked with the Coinhive code. The affected ads were from Google’s DoubleClick platform. Basically, the ads contained JavaScript that enabled cryptocurrency mining through Coinhive. YouTube users found their computer resources being consumed at a high rate (80%!) to mine Monero. An independent security researcher, Troy Mursch, told Ars Technica : YouTube was likely targeted because users are typically on the site for an extended period of time. This is a prime target for cryptojacking malware, because the longer the users are mining for cryptocurrency the more money is made. Google Responds Once reports of the YouTube ads being used to mine Monero came out, Google (parent company of YouTube) said that the issue had been dealt with within two hours. However, data from social media and Trend Micro, a cybersecurity company, showed that the infected ads ran for up to a week. Google did release an official statement that reads: Mining cryptocurrency through ads is a relatively new form of abuse that violates our policies and one that we’ve been monitoring actively. We enforce our policies through a multi-layered detection system across our platforms which we update as new threats emerge. In this case, the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms. The never-ending arms race between protection and hackers continues. The reality is that attempts by some people to get others to mine crypto for them, without their knowledge, is going to continue and probably expand. As long as cryptocurrencies gain in value, and the likelihood of being caught and punished is essentially nil, there’s an incredible incentive for hackers and their ilk to step up their efforts.

bitcoinist	zach-piester-singapore-become-hub-icos	Zach Piester: Singapore Has Become a Hub for ICOs - Bitcoinist.com	2018-01-20T21:00	Zach Piester, a co-founder of Intrepid Ventures, works in Central Asia and refers this part of the world to a center of the universe for him and his colleagues. During the interview with the media office of Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Philippines, he described the region in terms of the growth of blockchain companies there and revealed why investments in cryptocurrencies and blockchain would be a prerogative of major investors soon. Interviewer: Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Philippines (BCP) Speaker: Zach Piester (ZP) BCP: Mr. Piester, as a leading venture investor, what do you think about cryptocurrency investments? How risky and profitable is this asset? ZP: Firstly, all that I share is just my personal experiences. I am not offering investment advice in any way. It is for information purposes only and is easily searchable on Google. Need to separate “retail” investors, sophisticated investors and institutional investors (not that some retail investors are not sophisticated). For the retail investor, there is extreme risk, volatility, and the likelihood you’ll lose all of your investments. Although I won’t provide any investment advice, I would caution everyone considering investing in an ICO or other crypto projects to fully understand what they’re investing in. The same fundamental/traditional research and diligence rules apply e.g. good team, good tech, results, accountabilities, growth history/patterns etc… Cryptos and ICO are not for the beginners and you’ll likely get scammed and/or lose money. Sophisticated and institutional investors should proceed with due diligence relative to the new crypto economics. This includes team, tech, plan, history, backers etc… BCP: What minimal sum should investors enter the market with? ZP: Retail – the amount they can afford to lose because most likely they will lose it all. Institutional – depends, we are seeing more and more institutional capital come into the ecosystem. The amounts are very small relative to their overall portfolios. This is beginning to change as the tech matures and the economics (in chain) become better suited to institutional investors. Many family offices, PE funds, Hedge funds and Venture funds are committing millions to tens of millions on specific projects. Overall, a very small amount, yet some are gaining huge returns. There are definitely new “investment” models starting to emerge that provide institutional investors some downside risk protection and strong upside potential. BCP: Investors frequently say that they don’t want to interact with cryptocurrency because of having no clue about its origin and operation concept. Do you think it’s important for investors to have vast knowledge about cryptocurrencies and blockchain? What self-education sources would you recommend? ZP: Their loss. It’s a bit lazy, to be honest. If you’re not willing to invest the intellectual capital to understand new concepts and crypto economic models you are not suited for this space. The question I would ask is are you doing your LP’s a disservice by not being informed. Yes, the space may not be right for their portfolio but at least educate yourself. BCP: Blockchain mass media includes opinions that 90% of projects launching ICOs are scams. Based on your experience, do you think this figure is true? ZP: Through our ICO platform TokenDeck.io we receive on average 10-15 projects a day. More than half aren’t yet at a stage we believe they are ready to launch and raise capital. We like to see a serious commitment from the team which includes well-thought-out concepts (at a minimum, would prefer a working prototype of the tech), strong understanding of the tech, the team is realistic and rational in how much they want/need to raise and most importantly have at least consulted with an attorney. How many of these are ‘scams” or just bad projects…Most are just bad projects with an improper use of the blockchain, underdeveloped business and crypto economics, limited to no tech development and /or just money grabs…are these scams maybe.. There is a definite % of projects that are in fact scams…Several cryptocurrencies that are in the top 50 (by market cap) are widely viewed as scams yet their values increase. I believe this is the result of “newbies” coming into the space… the greater fools game is clearly evident in these projects. However, there are some phenomenal projects coming through with world-class developers and teams that have or are developing major breakthrough protocol layer innovations. There are some very smart people in the space doing amazing things that will undoubtedly change the world. We’re super fortunate to be able to attract these types of visionaries and entrepreneurs to work with us. BCP: Your company, Intrepid Ventures, cooperates with hundreds of startups in Southeast Asia (Singapore, Philippines etc.). Could you please describe the development of blockchain technologies in your region? Is it worse or better than in other regions? ZP: We’re a global small enterprise based out of Hong Kong. We have offices, team members, resources and projects across South East Asia, Europe and the Americas including Hong Kong, Singapore, Philippines, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Ukraine, New York, USA and South America. We see a ton of deal flow through our TokenDeck platform along with our 36 blockchain communities through BlockchainStartups.Global. SE Asia is the center of the universe for us. There are many very talented, hungry and motivated entrepreneurs in the region that are doing amazing things. I wouldn’t say one area or region is better than another. Each region has its own flavor of entrepreneurs and developers. We do see some trends including very strong technologists coming from Eastern Europe and our Lviv Ukraine office. We see a lot of hustle and grit from some of the emerging markets in SE Asia especially in Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. We’re finding some great social enterprises coming through in the Middle East and especially Africa. Singapore has become a hub for ICOs and there are some great companies in SG. BCP: Could you tell us how saturated is the Asian market of blockchain solutions? Is it difficult for a young company to succeed on it? ZP: We’ve barely gotten started and there’s enormous growth potential. We are seeing the copycats and clones starting to bubble up. A trend we’re definitely seeing around the world is that current startups that haven’t scaled or developed a product-market fit and now adding “blockchain” to their offering in the hopes of achieving success. Please stop adding blockchain to your food delivery app or other broken model. No, it’s not difficult for a young company to succeed if you’re solving a problem worth solving, utilizing the technology in new and unique ways, building a product, application or solution that people must have… it’s all very simple in the end. BCP: At Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Philippines, you will discuss investments in ICO tokens. Are you going to reveal other ways of investing in blockchain? If you are, what will you talk about? ZP: I will not be providing investment advice. I will inform, educate and entertain the audience on blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs. Will you be attending the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Philippines in Manila? Do you think that Singapore could become a hub for ICOs? Let us know in the comments below.

bitcoinist	zen-protocol-redefining-asset-trading-crypto-finance	Zen Protocol - Redefining Asset Trading and Crypto Finance - Bitcoinist.com	2017-12-15T10:00	Zen Protocol is a platform built for finance. We designed Zen to solve a real problem: trading assets without relying on third parties. Our team is based in Tel Aviv, with backgrounds in maths, finance, design, and marketing. Some of us have been involved in the Bitcoin space since 2011, and we’ve been creating tools to make Bitcoin better since 2013. In 2016, we began work on Zen Protocol. When Ethereum’s “theDAO” contract was hacked, it became clear to us that a platform designed for financial uses, like creating assets and granting rights, could provide much more security than was available at the time. Since then, we have been working on a new architecture that makes finance on the blockchain safe, fast, and useful. Zen Protocol uses an all-new codebase, with built-in tools that stop bugs from ever making it into the smart contracts you use on the platform. Zen will let you create and trade any sort of financial asset, with a modern system for using real-world data, and with links to the Bitcoin network. All of this is running right now in our testnet. Our crowdsale began on the 30th of November: over two-thirds of tokens have already been sold. Here are a few key points about Zen: Safe. The Zen Protocol uses a custom language, ZF*, that lets developers prove their contracts work correctly. Not only does this make contracts safer, it reduces development cost by accelerating testing and due diligence. Fast. Contracts are “proof of cost”, meaning that they show how long they take to run before they enter the Zen blockchain. This lets Zen Protocol can compile contracts, making them much faster than contracts on other blockchains. Useful. We’ve implemented an architecture for Zen that makes it easy to create and trade real-world assets. Any kind of asset or token on Zen Protocol is compatible with any contract, and oracles link products on Zen to any sort of data from the outside world. Check out our blog, pitch deck, and Telegram group, and view full details of the crowdsale. For inquiries about partnerships and other co-operation, contact us at [email protected]. How will Zen Protocol change how smart contracts are created an what impact will it have on future blockchain applications? Let us know what you think in the comments below.
